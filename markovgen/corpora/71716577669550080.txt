71716577669550080 (2017-11-03T03:05:00.317000+00:00) : so huge problem there
71716577669550080 (2017-11-03T03:04:52.056000+00:00) : and the fact that he's also exec producer on that show
71716577669550080 (2017-11-03T03:04:36.236000+00:00) : but thats the point he practically is getting paid to do it because of his role

71716577669550080 (2017-11-03T03:02:37.034000+00:00) : just him enjoying it i guess
71716577669550080 (2017-11-03T03:02:28.860000+00:00) : all the scenes in house of cards where spacy is having sexual interactions with his young security guard isnt even him acting

71716577669550080 (2017-10-31T17:45:10.554000+00:00) : when are the first pro games
71716577669550080 (2017-10-31T14:40:24.714000+00:00) : one of morphlings new talents is -25 sec morph cooldown (so you can have over 100% uptime) or morph targets allies
71716577669550080 (2017-10-31T14:40:01.379000+00:00) : actually wait
71716577669550080 (2017-10-31T14:38:55.403000+00:00) : im not sure
71716577669550080 (2017-10-31T14:38:53.768000+00:00) : also im pretty sure adaptive strike is actually 0 cooldown?
71716577669550080 (2017-10-31T14:36:49.472000+00:00) : its not any more buttons if you replace your replicate illusion button with the new adaptrive strike
71716577669550080 (2017-10-31T14:27:48.574000+00:00) : its just his lv 25 talent
71716577669550080 (2017-10-31T13:01:12.207000+00:00) : <@127535721857679362> https://streamable.com/1i2qg
71716577669550080 (2017-10-31T03:49:14.199000+00:00) : I'm going to be soon
71716577669550080 (2017-10-31T01:35:17.619000+00:00) : Also I'm pretty sure Kevin spacey's character in house of cards is just the same as him in real life
71716577669550080 (2017-10-31T01:34:51.695000+00:00) : The last season wasn't very good
71716577669550080 (2017-10-31T01:34:20.052000+00:00) : Oh yeah for sure but I'm pretty sure the decision had already been made to end it
71716577669550080 (2017-10-31T01:26:44.221000+00:00) : The last season was already nearing the end
71716577669550080 (2017-10-31T01:26:35.632000+00:00) : I don't think they canceled it it's just ending
71716577669550080 (2017-10-30T23:45:05.680000+00:00) : I like how the agi one doesn't have knockback
71716577669550080 (2017-10-30T23:44:19.865000+00:00) : And replace it with the new adaptive strike
71716577669550080 (2017-10-30T23:44:10.850000+00:00) : Well you can remove the replicate hero key binding
71716577669550080 (2017-10-30T23:43:27.633000+00:00) : And almost shotgun twice in one eblafe use
71716577669550080 (2017-10-30T23:43:15.668000+00:00) : That's true but you can morph faster now
71716577669550080 (2017-10-30T23:42:06.295000+00:00) : Not with ults but there are a lot of heroes who's strongest spell isn't their ult
71716577669550080 (2017-10-30T23:35:19.392000+00:00) : It's also an escape if your escapes are on cool down and if the enemy has one
71716577669550080 (2017-10-30T23:34:45.983000+00:00) : No because you can morph just to use a certain skill they have like hex or tombstone and then return to morph instantly
71716577669550080 (2017-10-30T23:02:59.686000+00:00) : and it's only a 3 second cooldown
71716577669550080 (2017-10-30T23:02:52.015000+00:00) : also: only the strength adaptive strike has knockback now
71716577669550080 (2017-10-30T22:57:24.884000+00:00) : it doesnt cost mana and the max rate of change went from 16 to 25 per second
71716577669550080 (2017-10-30T22:57:08.220000+00:00) : also do you realize how strong attribute shift is now
71716577669550080 (2017-10-30T22:56:23.754000+00:00) : and you can even more effectively use the enemy carry's power against them now
71716577669550080 (2017-10-30T22:56:10.460000+00:00) : thats a 10 second downtime
71716577669550080 (2017-10-30T22:55:54.495000+00:00) : you can be an enemy hero for 30 secodns every 40 seconds

71716577669550080 (2017-10-30T21:07:30.814000+00:00) : yeah honestly the new heroes are the least interesting part of this update

71716577669550080 (2017-10-18T19:15:01.893000+00:00) : I know but when I first thought that I dismissed it because he was way too big proportional to her
71716577669550080 (2017-10-18T19:13:42.678000+00:00) : I thought he was hiding in his coat at first but then couldn't figure out why she was so big

71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T14:28:02.190000+00:00) : if my meeting ends early

71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:13:00.923000+00:00) : and then the next day i have a big exam
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:12:55.229000+00:00) : and then keenan and i are seeing pokemon
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:12:48.407000+00:00) : because i have classes monday
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:12:42.184000+00:00) : especially because this time i'll have to leave sunday evening probably instead of monday morning
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:12:09.725000+00:00) : if possible i dont want to do another all nighter
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:12:03.260000+00:00) : depending on how good of an idea we have, thats what will determine how much effort i will put into it probably
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:10:56.925000+00:00) : it was just one day but i have fridays off anyway so it doesnt matter
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:10:46.103000+00:00) : had that already
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:10:43.130000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:10:21.336000+00:00) : and we probably cant plan the weekend before either since you'll be gone too right?
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:10:03.491000+00:00) : since we wont have the same planning time we did last year the night before
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:09:51.918000+00:00) : also i sort of dont know how serious i want to be with development this time
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:09:19.100000+00:00) : 2 right?
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:09:16.720000+00:00) : do you know when it starts?
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:07:34.771000+00:00) : i could arrive either friday evening or saturday morning, but on saturday i wouldnt get in until noon without any delays
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:06:50.639000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:06:18.169000+00:00) : we had a discussion and everyone agreed not to use that channel
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:06:09.408000+00:00) : sup
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:03:54.325000+00:00) : we've been doing it all these years no problems
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:03:48.342000+00:00) : you obviously arent hardcore enough to manage a single channel
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:03:08.953000+00:00) : with his maple syrup
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:03:02.248000+00:00) : asher just did
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:02:59.912000+00:00) : you and asher talk about work all the time
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:02:24.853000+00:00) : but they dont have normal computer science, which in my view is broader and more theoretical
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:02:12.897000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:01:47.441000+00:00) : i view those as different too
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:01:32.398000+00:00) : and their computer sicence option is called computer engineering
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:00:44.401000+00:00) : just cognitive psychology
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T02:00:39.266000+00:00) : my other problem with workday is that they dont have cognitive science as a major option
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:57:14.702000+00:00) : im not sure how early i applied to facebook
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:56:39.019000+00:00) : like a few days after their application opened
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:56:33.002000+00:00) : yeah but i did appply to google fairly early
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:56:03.577000+00:00) : i think all the big companies take a while
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:55:29.966000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:54:23.852000+00:00) : i guess it should be fairly easy to apply for multiple roles within adobe
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:53:03.393000+00:00) : because they all have their own specific workday portal
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:52:51.686000+00:00) : i hate how all these companies use workday for applications but theres no way to save applications across companies
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:50:35.224000+00:00) : i can do it right now

71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:40:33.166000+00:00) : actually you need to try really hard to get into microsoft

71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:31:54.690000+00:00) : how long do you have to decide?
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:31:36.838000+00:00) : but does it have an effect outside that company
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:31:09.618000+00:00) : you cant go back on an offer right
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:31:02.263000+00:00) : 5k sining means just upfront for accepting the offer?
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:30:23.408000+00:00) : well if you end up working at fidelity tell them their website sucks for me
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:29:57.149000+00:00) : yeah just say you have competing offers
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:29:39.739000+00:00) : and their color choices suck
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:29:25.692000+00:00) : and they dont have a favicon
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:29:18.044000+00:00) : also their video thumbnails are really low res
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:29:08.807000+00:00) : your test results?
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:29:06.128000+00:00) : what does amazon need to follow through on
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:28:42.324000+00:00) : why?
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:28:39.830000+00:00) : their website really dissuades me from applying there
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T01:27:30.255000+00:00) : actually i think i looked at their website and wasnt impressed

71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:32:00.901000+00:00) : I don't know how they made such a perfect non-nintendo nintendo game
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:31:49.747000+00:00) : this game is perfect
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:25:04.352000+00:00) : it's taking htem a while to schedule the phone interview, i filled out the survey they wanted last thursday
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:24:51.704000+00:00) : well see though
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:24:44.795000+00:00) : and i could be placed with a porject that most mathces my interests
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:24:35.508000+00:00) : yeah they told me there will be like 3-4 person teams doing different projects
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:24:05.803000+00:00) : there might be subdivisions
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:24:01.440000+00:00) : i think their intern program is just one area
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:23:34.736000+00:00) : i gave myself a 5/5 on javascript, so i'll probably get a bunch of hard js questions that i dont know
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:23:10.635000+00:00) : and said they would schedule an interview designed around what i said afterwards
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:22:53.557000+00:00) : they just made me rank my proficiency at a lot of programming languages
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:22:38.362000+00:00) : not yet
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:22:33.346000+00:00) : they havent scheduled it yet though
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:22:10.351000+00:00) : i did i have a phone interview with them
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:22:01.830000+00:00) : my main complaint with this game is that i think there's too much voice acting
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:19:06.022000+00:00) : this is just the gateway to my super mario odyssey photo mode addiction
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:18:31.739000+00:00) : i spend at least 30% of my time in the photo mode
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:17:03.309000+00:00) : hat kid is too pure for that
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:13:47.664000+00:00) : yay

71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:03:17.345000+00:00) : like i thought it was akin to slime-san
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:02:59.830000+00:00) : i thought it was much smaller of a game than it is
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:02:50.788000+00:00) : thats so weird
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:02:25+00:00) : but i guess it makes since the physical is more because it's an indie game
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:02:13.623000+00:00) : oh thats a weird price
71716577669550080 (2017-10-17T00:01:31.256000+00:00) : isnt it like a 15 dollar game

71716577669550080 (2017-10-16T23:57:00.619000+00:00) : i want to play it at the same time as you
71716577669550080 (2017-10-16T23:55:05.894000+00:00) : hm this influences my decision to play it
71716577669550080 (2017-10-16T23:51:40.746000+00:00) : asher are you actually playing hat or do you just have it open

71716577669550080 (2017-10-16T23:04:33.516000+00:00) : you probably just haev to grind
71716577669550080 (2017-10-16T22:47:59.388000+00:00) : I own it and have it in my playlist I just don't listen to it when I play because I don't need to hear it that many times
71716577669550080 (2017-10-16T22:44:42.262000+00:00) : We'll see. If this game actually has a good sountrack I don't even know what I'll do. They will have broken Mac.
71716577669550080 (2017-10-16T22:37:05.529000+00:00) : The game probably has like one song

71716577669550080 (2017-10-07T16:28:43.799000+00:00) : you should really listen to their podcast, they're responsible for the writing  and localization of a lot of your favorite games

71716577669550080 (2017-10-07T15:39:24.473000+00:00) : only like 5 review outlets have reviewed the game and they arent even major ones
71716577669550080 (2017-10-07T15:39:03.203000+00:00) : ive been following the development for a long time and im a little dissappointed with the dev's marketing
71716577669550080 (2017-10-07T15:35:46.221000+00:00) : especially because i need to finish it before mario comes out
71716577669550080 (2017-10-07T15:35:16.213000+00:00) : which is agood length
71716577669550080 (2017-10-07T15:35:09.706000+00:00) : i heard the game only takes 16 hours or so to 100%

71716577669550080 (2017-10-07T15:32:36.685000+00:00) : their official statement is "fall" but i wouldnt count on it because like i said it's a kickstarted project that decided to port to consoles at the last minute
71716577669550080 (2017-10-07T15:32:06.857000+00:00) : i think ps4 and xbox by the end of the year is likely and switch will be later because they only recently got dev kits
71716577669550080 (2017-10-07T15:20:58.232000+00:00) : it started as a pc exclusive and it was a kickstarted game so it might still be a while

71716577669550080 (2017-09-26T15:38:18.624000+00:00) : and also maybe for the high res art when you beat a puzzle but it will probably still be pixel art
71716577669550080 (2017-09-26T15:37:48.358000+00:00) : nobody because it's never happened before
71716577669550080 (2017-09-26T15:37:40.231000+00:00) : i think the only reason you should get a switch version of picross is the co-op local multiplayer and the tv play but who plays picross on their tvs
71716577669550080 (2017-09-26T15:36:48.822000+00:00) : (i personally think picross is better suited for 3ds though)
71716577669550080 (2017-09-26T15:36:13.333000+00:00) : its only 7
71716577669550080 (2017-09-26T15:36:07.468000+00:00) : are you getting picross on thursday?
71716577669550080 (2017-09-26T15:35:05.406000+00:00) : they should just have a checkers mode in chess
71716577669550080 (2017-09-26T15:33:32.906000+00:00) : everyone knows chess
71716577669550080 (2017-09-26T15:33:06.435000+00:00) : just wait until monopoly comes out
71716577669550080 (2017-09-26T15:33:00.859000+00:00) : dont you see it's genius

71716577669550080 (2017-09-26T15:26:42.677000+00:00) : since i dont have an ipad
71716577669550080 (2017-09-26T15:26:40.157000+00:00) : but switch screen is big enough to be actual tabletop

71716577669550080 (2017-09-26T15:26:00.180000+00:00) : and phone chess games are dumb
71716577669550080 (2017-09-26T15:25:53.431000+00:00) : but its not portable

71716577669550080 (2017-09-25T16:53:08.520000+00:00) : you could also enter through the mall right
71716577669550080 (2017-09-25T16:52:54.236000+00:00) : arent there two entrances to target though
71716577669550080 (2017-09-25T16:52:27.193000+00:00) : we can but that means we have to shift everything down by two hours since it opens first
71716577669550080 (2017-09-25T16:51:53.800000+00:00) : so the only thing that matters is how early you want to get
71716577669550080 (2017-09-25T16:51:42.100000+00:00) : yeah we all have stuff at 11 but bestbuy opens at 10 and it will only take like 20 minutes once it opens

71716577669550080 (2017-09-22T17:10:12.889000+00:00) : It's the catalog that matters

71716577669550080 (2017-08-22T19:55:18.001000+00:00) : it is a good class but im going to have to take handwritten notes and i wasnt prepared for that today

71716577669550080 (2017-08-22T19:37:49.629000+00:00) : because its probably a general intro class for non majors
71716577669550080 (2017-08-22T19:36:29.173000+00:00) : no it was a school in maryland where my profess got his degree

71716577669550080 (2017-08-22T19:26:03.625000+00:00) : it was definitely the hardest class ive taken at IU but also our teacher did not explain things well and our textbook sucked

71716577669550080 (2017-08-22T17:58:57.089000+00:00) : especially gamestop
71716577669550080 (2017-08-22T17:58:48.285000+00:00) : gamestop, toysrus, walmart, all have shitty websites
71716577669550080 (2017-08-22T17:58:23.752000+00:00) : i like them because their online/technology presence is the most robust out of any store besides amazon
71716577669550080 (2017-08-22T17:56:54.138000+00:00) : aw

71716577669550080 (2017-08-22T17:32:19.443000+00:00) : but toysrus has yet to make preorders live
71716577669550080 (2017-08-22T17:32:03.861000+00:00) : i think other stores are just inferior
71716577669550080 (2017-08-22T17:31:54.931000+00:00) : amazon and bestbuy preorders were in stock for 20 minutes
71716577669550080 (2017-08-22T17:31:43.517000+00:00) : idk whats the issue
71716577669550080 (2017-08-22T17:31:36.363000+00:00) : it was like 10x easier to get a switch when pre-orders went live

71716577669550080 (2017-08-21T05:42:16.035000+00:00) : Offlane has been a farm heavy role for a several patches now
71716577669550080 (2017-08-21T05:41:54.060000+00:00) : I don't think that will really change
71716577669550080 (2017-08-21T05:41:03.394000+00:00) : Or change how xp works
71716577669550080 (2017-08-21T05:40:44.178000+00:00) : Or just remove the extra creep
71716577669550080 (2017-08-21T05:40:29.767000+00:00) : They 100% will or they'll put the extra creep in the sidelanes instead so the trilanes go back there
71716577669550080 (2017-08-21T05:38:29.071000+00:00) : I think new patch will just nerf the duo and trilanes in mid
71716577669550080 (2017-08-21T05:37:55.838000+00:00) : But more clowny

71716577669550080 (2017-08-21T05:34:50.412000+00:00) : And take their free qualifier spot to every major and minor seriously
71716577669550080 (2017-08-21T05:34:14.641000+00:00) : I still think SA needs to get their shit together
71716577669550080 (2017-08-21T05:33:14.559000+00:00) : It was super one sided for og though
71716577669550080 (2017-08-21T05:31:47.555000+00:00) : I guess forev and dubu maybe went back to korea

71716577669550080 (2017-08-21T05:28:56.857000+00:00) : Mss kind of has been underperforming recently on offlane
71716577669550080 (2017-08-21T05:28:41.799000+00:00) : I think dc is weird but I guess it could work

71716577669550080 (2017-08-20T01:04:14.428000+00:00) : it's an indie game but im not sure if some of the other original people from sega are working on it
71716577669550080 (2017-08-20T01:03:32.754000+00:00) : it also has the same composer
71716577669550080 (2017-08-20T01:03:28.568000+00:00) : i think it's a spiritual successor

71716577669550080 (2017-08-20T01:00:04.174000+00:00) : this is like party music
71716577669550080 (2017-08-20T00:59:40.693000+00:00) : not like on a larger scale of 1-2 minutes like most games
71716577669550080 (2017-08-20T00:59:26.935000+00:00) : its repetetive on small scale with the phrases and stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-08-20T00:58:06.684000+00:00) : i know but that also has its downsides because i think it can get repetetive
71716577669550080 (2017-08-20T00:56:19.414000+00:00) : but its still like just repeating words and stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-08-20T00:56:10.786000+00:00) : in future theres a lot of english
71716577669550080 (2017-08-20T00:56:02.356000+00:00) : but it took me until actually playing splatoon 1 to start liking the soundtrack
71716577669550080 (2017-08-20T00:55:38.708000+00:00) : yeah the main difference is that the lyrics are in english instead of weird squid language
71716577669550080 (2017-08-20T00:54:57.290000+00:00) : i didnt liek the splatoon soundtrack at first when it came out

71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:58:16.554000+00:00) : the only redeeming part about this water level is it has a part that reminds me of my favorite scene from the incredibles

71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:29:58.846000+00:00) : because its an intro class
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:29:54.903000+00:00) : they dont know what they are talking about
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:29:49.190000+00:00) : so you cant trust people if they are rating for an intro class
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:28:56.453000+00:00) : but my class was an upper level math class

71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:09:10.273000+00:00) : when you think of activision
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:08:22.872000+00:00) : he's a super hero
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:08:10.834000+00:00) : mario isnt a human you dummy
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:06:13.421000+00:00) : the art style isnt because they were trying to replicate the genesis but because they were an indie team with a low budget
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:05:41.772000+00:00) : it really feels like it could just be a brand new indie game
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:04:05.455000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:04:03.743000+00:00) : i just htink it can be a little confusing and some stuff should be distinguished more
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:03:50.253000+00:00) : the art is really really good
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:03:46.382000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:02:48.303000+00:00) : i think they expected sonic fans to be playing this
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:02:41.427000+00:00) : it will just take more experience i think
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:02:34.287000+00:00) : its hard to know what damages me and what doesnt
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:02:10.908000+00:00) : my only problem is that i think the visual language is a little inconsistent and confusing
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:01:20.080000+00:00) : guys i found this new platformer that really innovates on the genre
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:00:28.257000+00:00) : just speed based
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:00:24.604000+00:00) : its not precision based or combat based
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T23:00:06.188000+00:00) : its cool to play a platformer that isnt either the mario model or the mega man model
71716577669550080 (2017-08-19T22:59:13.420000+00:00) : i really like it

71716577669550080 (2017-08-11T17:49:42.689000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-08-11T17:48:58.118000+00:00) : I have a subscription to them so i saw that, but I kind of just wrote it off as a kids thing and didn't realize the Garfield factor until now
71716577669550080 (2017-08-11T17:39:15.152000+00:00) : Yup
71716577669550080 (2017-08-11T17:38:19.980000+00:00) : Nick is probably not a bad person, he's just irresponsible
71716577669550080 (2017-08-11T17:37:58.922000+00:00) : I guess it's probably up to Griffin
71716577669550080 (2017-08-11T17:37:03.424000+00:00) : I think in general he doesn't know as mucba about games
71716577669550080 (2017-08-11T17:36:49.047000+00:00) : Lol maybe
71716577669550080 (2017-08-11T17:35:10.085000+00:00) : But it's hard to tell
71716577669550080 (2017-08-11T17:34:48.806000+00:00) : Yeah one person would probably just tell him to fuck off and he'd go to the next
71716577669550080 (2017-08-11T17:33:50.633000+00:00) : I think it was persistent across many people but maybe not so much so with the same person
71716577669550080 (2017-08-11T17:32:20.043000+00:00) : But that's the worst I really saw
71716577669550080 (2017-08-11T17:32:02.660000+00:00) : Basically his idea of flirting is telling people to send nudes
71716577669550080 (2017-08-11T17:31:29.727000+00:00) : They are on neogaf
71716577669550080 (2017-08-11T17:28:48.149000+00:00) : His apology was decent but I kind of find it unbelievable that it took him until now to realize that having power means he needs to also be responsible for his actions
71716577669550080 (2017-08-11T17:27:45.938000+00:00) : Well i hope he finds success independently

71716577669550080 (2017-08-10T17:49:23.935000+00:00) : There's banana bread on the table if you want it
71716577669550080 (2017-08-10T16:37:19.630000+00:00) : <@!127535721857679362> ronald after you take the train, get off at westlake station and then walk towards a store called nordstroms and there's an elevator to get to the monorail which is faster and takes you right to seattle center

71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T02:59:55.414000+00:00) : Timado is so charming
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T02:52:06.056000+00:00) : I think it was a safe draft based on their day four success
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T02:51:33.734000+00:00) : It gets first banned against him
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T02:51:25.891000+00:00) : Forev is really good at it
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T02:51:14.239000+00:00) : Idk they won a couple games with that exact draft basically on day 4
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T02:49:53.571000+00:00) : I think fata plays really well on death prophet as much b as I hate that hero

71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T02:48:55.805000+00:00) : Yeah it's really hard to fault envy
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T02:47:35.752000+00:00) : I'm happy for reso but I dont really think empire deserve him
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T02:47:02.535000+00:00) : Seems sort of unfair
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T02:46:56.559000+00:00) : I'm kind of salty that empire can win with a super good standin

71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T02:29:06.352000+00:00) : Three long fights at the c9s base and empire still don't have a rax
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T02:28:35.449000+00:00) : Empire also has no push
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T02:28:29.950000+00:00) : Damn
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T02:26:40.491000+00:00) : They can potentially still win with arc Warden split push but it's rough
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T02:25:31.447000+00:00) : Man how come c9 can't get any kills
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T02:01:30.500000+00:00) : This game is going to be really close
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T01:52:05.360000+00:00) : <:sadboy:230133848740986891>
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T01:45:29.900000+00:00) : How much you want to bet that tobi and synderen cast the grand finals
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T01:42:22.487000+00:00) : He seemed pretty successful on arc earlier
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T01:37:12.160000+00:00) : No I think you just get a ticket when you enter and you turn it back in when you leave
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T01:36:28.367000+00:00) : They have constant shuttles going back and forth between the airport
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T01:35:40.752000+00:00) : It's pretty good service too you get free water bottle
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T01:35:26.412000+00:00) : It's 8 dollars per day there instead of 9 i think
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T01:35:07.411000+00:00) : But make sure you park at Fastpark
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T01:34:56.598000+00:00) : Also Asher I think it's just easier if i ride with my mom
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T01:33:58.976000+00:00) : There are a lot of reasons why they are good
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T01:32:09.393000+00:00) : 1106 is the one I'm trying to get on

71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T01:23:14.583000+00:00) : It's like 8 dollars a night to park your car which isn't bad
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T01:22:46.897000+00:00) : <@125452744440938497> are you riding with us?
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T01:11:44.914000+00:00) : Yeah we can wait for you
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T01:03:31.311000+00:00) : Thursday
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:56:41.319000+00:00) : I meant to ping <@125452744440938497>
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:56:18.855000+00:00) : <@127535721857679362> that aui interview was very good
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:53:11.600000+00:00) : They start at 10:30 and there are usually only 3 best of threes per day
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:52:51.282000+00:00) : Or maybe even 6
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:52:20.987000+00:00) : Games are going to go really late today but i th every other day they won't go later than 7 or 8
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:50:52.107000+00:00) : Idk I'm really flexible on food
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:50:35.146000+00:00) : I think it would be a good idea to buy bagels or something for breakfast and eat out at dinner and sometimes lunch. I'd imagine we will skip lunch sometimes depending on who is playing
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:49:38.695000+00:00) : Because honestly I don't need much to sustain myself
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:49:21.698000+00:00) : Also we might go shopping
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:49:13.858000+00:00) : People on Reddit have been recommending some stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:49:02.113000+00:00) : Ut there's also some cheap restaurants around the area that we can check out
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:48:42.834000+00:00) : There's a big food court near the arena
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:46:52.526000+00:00) : This is kind of sad
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:46:44.439000+00:00) : Wow they are doing losers interviews

71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:21:06.234000+00:00) : I just ended up seeing him a lot because he works in my building
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:20:43.206000+00:00) : Not really but we say hi to each other and stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:19:22.032000+00:00) : I'm not sure exactly what he does but he helps make parts and deliver stuff for the research labs
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:18:28.418000+00:00) : Just last week he cleaned our labs fridge
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:18:19.600000+00:00) : Idk I see him occasionally
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:18:01.255000+00:00) : As like a machine shop intern or something

71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:14:00.554000+00:00) : Good I don't want to have to bear that stress by myself
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:13:34.645000+00:00) : Asher are you going to be done in time to watch c9 empire
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:10:26.743000+00:00) : You should do racquet sports or something
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:10:10.318000+00:00) : Lol
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:04:35.434000+00:00) : if you ever get a chance to take a number theory class you should because it makes you feel like a badass
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:03:45.042000+00:00) : although in my cryptography class i learned a bunch of really cool ways of working with large prime numbers without using calculators
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:02:33.600000+00:00) : in my math classes where you cant use calculators you never see numbers higher than 30 or decimals smaller than 2 digits of precision
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:02:02.995000+00:00) : i bet for engineering classes a good calculator is basically mandatory because they design the questions with realistic numbers
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:00:23.788000+00:00) : but since you're doing engineering they probably will let you
71716577669550080 (2017-08-08T00:00:16.118000+00:00) : upper level math classes never let you use calculators
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:58:52.364000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:57:58.391000+00:00) : i got (11+sqrt(7)) / 3
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:55:01.634000+00:00) : I woudl multiply by (sqrt(7) + 2)/(sqrt(7) +2)
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:37:58.190000+00:00) : 8 teams play, 4 will get eliminated
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:37:40.985000+00:00) : All 4 bo1s
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:37:32.561000+00:00) : No it's right now
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:35:30.670000+00:00) : These lower bracket matches are going to be so hype
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:33:11.816000+00:00) : But idk these Chinese teams are being strong

71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:32:09.195000+00:00) : It's only bo1s for the first round
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:31:56.164000+00:00) : No
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:30:16.778000+00:00) : The bo3
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:27:53.169000+00:00) : This is the play of the tournament
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:27:45.507000+00:00) : https://www.dotabuff.com/clips/newbee-trades-5-for-1-3362390555-e99fc1dcaaca
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:27:40.193000+00:00) : Because we couldn't find available housing to cover 7 days and it would have been more expensive
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:27:00.592000+00:00) : Newbee. They lost
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:22:48.331000+00:00) : Wow.
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:20:06.900000+00:00) : There were like 7 buybacks in one fight
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:19:51.837000+00:00) : Asher are you watching this
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:11:59.121000+00:00) : 🇨🇳
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:09:21.407000+00:00) : Ugh
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:08:37.806000+00:00) : Goddamnit eg is throwing
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:06:33.873000+00:00) : "constant of proportionality"is a strange term
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T23:04:06.155000+00:00) : Yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T22:59:11.789000+00:00) : And even after like 5 years since I've learned trig I still have to look up the damn circle every time
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T22:58:39.224000+00:00) : My problem whenever i take those tests is that they usually make you do basic trig
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T22:56:35.085000+00:00) : It's simple calcus
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T22:54:45.684000+00:00) : Can't you basically look up everything or do they time you
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T22:52:55.085000+00:00) : I can see why free response would be shitty
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T22:52:35.827000+00:00) : I'm pretty sure the one I took was multiple choice. But I also think it didn't matter because of AP credit
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T22:50:05.234000+00:00) : Math is a beautiful thing
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T22:49:56.169000+00:00) : My friend.
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T22:05:38.212000+00:00) : Holy shit that whole segment was gold
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T22:02:38.700000+00:00) : JACKS CORNER
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T21:57:42.674000+00:00) : SumIl and crit took too long to buy back
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T21:57:25.663000+00:00) : Holy shit
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T21:55:25.478000+00:00) : EG :(
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:56:58.141000+00:00) : All these teams and their dumb blue logos
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:49:10.456000+00:00) : I love these TI archives
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:45:54.198000+00:00) : I can't wait for execration and infamous to win their games and then the panel acting like it's a huge unexpected outcome
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:44:13.967000+00:00) : Idk I think they all look waxed
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:39:32.773000+00:00) : i guess he's immortal though isnt he
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:39:08.555000+00:00) : but his powers are closer to ironman's
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:38:19.570000+00:00) : the gods are also kind of difficult
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:37:06.494000+00:00) : there are no other categories
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:37:02.419000+00:00) : we really di hack comics
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:36:53.871000+00:00) : shit
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:35:59.838000+00:00) : then why isnt he iron man
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:35:48.955000+00:00) : i thought he was hit by a lightning bolt
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:35:32.923000+00:00) : the flash = iron man
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:35:20.538000+00:00) : batman = ironman
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:33:34.889000+00:00) : basically all the iron mans are super heroes because of external events and all the wolverines were naturally born to have some power
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:32:30.722000+00:00) : yeah i better go call up stan lee and warn him
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:31:30.849000+00:00) : silver iron man = iron man
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:31:21.629000+00:00) : black panther = iron man
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:31:14.991000+00:00) : vulture = iron man

71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:31:04.601000+00:00) : ant-man = iron man
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:29:47.838000+00:00) : yeah almost every marvel super hero is either an iron man rip off or a wolverine ripoff
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:26:53.310000+00:00) : Lol sometimes when you own too many IPs you accidentally copy yourself
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:25:58.998000+00:00) : Did you know the fantastic nfour is just a worse version of the Incredibles
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:24:54.796000+00:00) : Is that the invisible one
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:24:22.989000+00:00) : You offend me
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:24:07.507000+00:00) : Ember spirit isn't stretchy
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:23:50.421000+00:00) : Isn't he the stretchy one
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:23:12.041000+00:00) : He's basically like that one fantastic four guy
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:22:27.985000+00:00) : Ember spirit
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:22:13.753000+00:00) : Also Keenan just so you know that orange fire guy on radiant is my favorite hero
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T20:14:41.485000+00:00) : It's a lot more difficult to follow without sound so i don't blame you

71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T19:32:15.307000+00:00) : It's probably more useful in the early game
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T19:32:04.757000+00:00) : It might have been happening too fast for the overlay guys to overlay
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T19:31:35.028000+00:00) : So you wont

71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T19:28:14.551000+00:00) : I think the overlays are all text anyway
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T19:27:22.592000+00:00) : You should probably watch that instead it will make things a little more clear
71716577669550080 (2017-08-07T19:26:45.257000+00:00) : Also Keenan there's a newcomer stream this year which h is the exact same but with extra help boxes overlayed

71716577669550080 (2017-08-06T16:32:34.649000+00:00) : Basically ever since Microsoft bought them most of the work is done by experienced studios which raise the game to AAA
71716577669550080 (2017-08-06T16:31:07.791000+00:00) : Eventually the Java edition will be discontinued I'm sure
71716577669550080 (2017-08-06T16:30:48.596000+00:00) : Which is why all ports of the game use a custom engine that fixes all that
71716577669550080 (2017-08-06T16:30:19.235000+00:00) : The code foundation is really bad
71716577669550080 (2017-08-06T16:30:13.429000+00:00) : The Java version was created without knowledge that it would be huge and continuously updated for several years
71716577669550080 (2017-08-06T16:29:35.964000+00:00) : No
71716577669550080 (2017-08-06T16:28:58.783000+00:00) : And it's not because of incompetent deveopers
71716577669550080 (2017-08-06T16:28:09.981000+00:00) : Well there's a reason Minecraft is the way it is
71716577669550080 (2017-08-06T15:44:41.105000+00:00) : Keenan and I played through the first one a bit and it's a good game
71716577669550080 (2017-08-06T15:44:00.272000+00:00) : Yeah it basically means i no longer need a ps4
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T23:50:51.135000+00:00) : k
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T23:49:09.057000+00:00) : i kind of want to play dota
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T23:37:13.568000+00:00) : planet odd lives on
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T23:36:37.039000+00:00) : resolution is going to get his revenge against c9
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T23:30:57.515000+00:00) : ok panel pls stop talking about og pls thnx
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T23:27:08.077000+00:00) : yeah my boy blitz hating on the monkey king
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T23:23:57.854000+00:00) : but theoretically the groub b teams are stronger i think
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T23:23:45.553000+00:00) : because you never know
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T23:23:42.207000+00:00) : yeah if i were an og fan i would be worried to face either infamous or empire
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T23:22:24.049000+00:00) : if anything i would be most scared of the peruvian team
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T23:22:07.342000+00:00) : secret and igv seem strong on paper but they historically havent been good in that situation
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T23:21:30.547000+00:00) : i honestly think that most of the lower bracket teams in group B can probably beat the ones in group A
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T23:20:49.865000+00:00) : OG LUL
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T23:19:12.503000+00:00) : ti4 was sad in multiple ways
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T23:14:48.807000+00:00) : im very surprised there were no tiebreakers at all
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T23:14:40.910000+00:00) : good shit
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T22:28:04.739000+00:00) : i just hope the main event one will actually do the job of a panel
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T22:16:31.638000+00:00) : the winner will be upper bracket since they are tied
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T22:16:23.578000+00:00) : yeah thats a very important game i think
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T22:14:51.140000+00:00) : ya
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T22:14:26.516000+00:00) : besides blitz
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T22:14:25.022000+00:00) : specifically pros who couldnt qualify
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T22:13:55.698000+00:00) : pros
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T22:09:10.365000+00:00) : i think groub B was the harder group
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T21:56:17.092000+00:00) : since he cant bash on his ult anymore his ult isnt even that interesting to watch
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T21:55:56.096000+00:00) : i think it's about the same either way
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T21:55:10.439000+00:00) : i think mk is trash
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T21:54:59.295000+00:00) : im not
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T21:37:33.428000+00:00) : aui could win a ti again with techies
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T21:33:32.923000+00:00) : he won ti5

71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T21:30:27.931000+00:00) : lion
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T21:30:26.609000+00:00) : idk theres a few more than four i thought
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T21:29:54.215000+00:00) : thats what i would do
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T21:29:46.373000+00:00) : what if
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T21:07:48.807000+00:00) : i still cant decide if it's a good thing we're missing monday or not
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T21:06:50.308000+00:00) : yea
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T21:06:19.878000+00:00) : that will be hype
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T21:06:15.744000+00:00) : secret might play c9 round one lowerbracket on monday
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T21:04:46.973000+00:00) : except maybe wings last year
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T21:04:34.323000+00:00) : idk typically teams that do really well ing roups dont do well overall
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T20:59:28.547000+00:00) : because lfy was already guaranteed first
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T20:58:34.252000+00:00) : ppd tweeted that it was going to be free for og yesterday lol
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T19:00:25.436000+00:00) : thats good
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T18:21:41.698000+00:00) : they literally cant cast without mentioning "throws" or "questionable plays"
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T18:20:39.618000+00:00) : it's the same 3 talking points every time
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T18:20:33.078000+00:00) : or a weird ee decision
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T18:20:27.672000+00:00) : this cast is almost unbearable because you cant go 30 seconds without lumi mentioning a cloud 9 moment
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T18:20:05.244000+00:00) : i really hate the memes surrounding cloud 9
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T17:54:44.787000+00:00) : actually i think even then they might play tiebreakers
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T17:52:58.440000+00:00) : what happens if hellraisers 2-0 them
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T17:48:01.031000+00:00) : i knew NA would pick it eventually
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T17:28:38.738000+00:00) : that was a good game
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T17:21:34.802000+00:00) : because they would lose without him
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T16:49:20.603000+00:00) : they just want to double pipe and seige rax with dp and arc warden
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T16:48:38.213000+00:00) : they have a seiging team
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T16:48:33.426000+00:00) : i dont see a problem with that build

71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T13:34:56.456000+00:00) : Yeah if he didn't he wouldn't be unknown now would he
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T13:19:40.114000+00:00) : Asher we can meet the man himself https://twitter.com/PLAYERUNKNOWN/status/893748400633503744
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T06:02:46.989000+00:00) : abed i think has the second highest core score from those teams
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T06:02:31.120000+00:00) : and ana has the highest core score
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T06:02:26.498000+00:00) : and forev has the highest offlane score so far
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T06:02:17.007000+00:00) : bulba and boboka have the highest support scores
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T06:02:09.024000+00:00) : pick OG, IG, or DC players because they all play two games and have a shot at playing more than that with tiebreakers
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T05:53:26.701000+00:00) : <@!125452744440938497> yo dont forget fantassy in the morning

71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T03:51:39.121000+00:00) : ok im ready
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T03:05:18.245000+00:00) : i can in probably 30 minutes
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T03:04:01.689000+00:00) : he can probably be successful independently though
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T03:03:41.190000+00:00) : well he wont be at polygon for sure
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T03:00:23.119000+00:00) : im thinking it will all be resolved behind the scenes so people dont have to go public about it
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:59:24.072000+00:00) : yeah it's pretty bad when even your friends express anger about it
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:54:48.188000+00:00) : yeah game devs that i follow who arent even journalists are tweeting about it
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:48:40.913000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:48:38.650000+00:00) : nick's sex life
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:47:40.546000+00:00) : i have nothing against whatever they might be into but that may be a hint
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:47:19.656000+00:00) : then i went through her feed and thought it was strange
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:47:09.152000+00:00) : the top comment on that video was a link to his girlfriend's twitter posting where she posted a picture of herself posing in underwear with nick in the background at his computer recording the video
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:46:11.580000+00:00) : remember when he did the wolfenstein is a good video game video?
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:45:50.951000+00:00) : true
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:45:40.182000+00:00) : which is pretty bad
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:45:33.898000+00:00) : it seems like it may have been a persistent thing
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:45:24.910000+00:00) : but it's unclear if it's even because he got drunk once and did it
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:44:54.580000+00:00) : he retweets really lewd photos of girls and cosplayers in the game community
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:44:31.611000+00:00) : but there are some hints in his twitter feed like i said
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:44:02.966000+00:00) : people probalby dont want to directly come out because then they might get attacked, like that tweet asher linked
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:43:46.519000+00:00) : well its alluded to in the neogaf post but not explicity described
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:43:10.770000+00:00) : in the games industry
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:43:00.591000+00:00) : it seems like he just harassed a bunch of people on twitter
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:42:42.096000+00:00) : i was looking forward to his mario odyssey coverage
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:42:35.115000+00:00) : yeah his actual thoughts on video games align almost exactly with mine
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:40:19.559000+00:00) : it's hilarious that this all got out because of the overcooked switch port
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:40:05.680000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:39:52.938000+00:00) : i feel like someone died
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:38:04.665000+00:00) : it seemed a bit out of place
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:37:50.128000+00:00) : also his girlfriend that he lives with (i think?) posts borderline porn on twitter
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:37:02.641000+00:00) : i can definitely see this as being true, he does occasionally retweet weird stuff on twitter
71716577669550080 (2017-08-05T02:27:44.323000+00:00) : More details http://m.neogaf.com/showthread.php?t=1415751

71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T14:16:02.725000+00:00) : Idk, that's like a 45 dollar mask
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T14:12:04.285000+00:00) : https://www.specialreservegames.com/reserves/absolver
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T14:10:59.181000+00:00) : There's a very limited run of it by a different company

71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T13:49:15.474000+00:00) : oh right
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T13:47:38.870000+00:00) : which one
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T13:45:22.846000+00:00) : the main downside for amazon at least for me is that it doesnt work for amiibo
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T13:44:23.701000+00:00) : for bestbuy's thing, you pay 30 dollars for two years and you can get 20% off any video game thing any time, even on top of normal sales they have
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T13:43:37.218000+00:00) : well you always get 20% for preorders and for buying the game up to two weeks after release
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T13:43:10.645000+00:00) : you have to have prime
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T13:42:22.519000+00:00) : im just saying if you want to buy new games, 48 is not that much more expensive than 40 and you dont have to wait for a used copy and you get a new game
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T13:40:43.380000+00:00) : thats more of a discount than amazon or bestbuy but if you use them you can get 20% off every new game, and bestbuy includes amiibo and accessories and stuff as well
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T13:38:32.328000+00:00) : thats not 10%
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T13:38:15.546000+00:00) : why so much off

71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T02:22:18.425000+00:00) : there are a lot of studies showing that living on campus is way better for academic performance and a healty livelihood
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T02:20:55.241000+00:00) : adding an extra 2 hours of travel each day (conservative) is not good for stress when you have to deal so much other academic shit
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T02:19:34.706000+00:00) : if he has at least one in-person class a day it's not a good idea

71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T02:18:23.125000+00:00) : it's literally dumb
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T02:18:06.285000+00:00) : its not good for academics
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T02:17:50.453000+00:00) : for a student
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T02:17:47.923000+00:00) : thats a super bad idea
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T02:01:04.322000+00:00) : 1-2 days for people from out of town to come and get set up before classe start
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T02:00:43.362000+00:00) : well no thats what orientation is for
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T02:00:25.487000+00:00) : yeah i guess normally all that stuff would be done at orientation but you probably dont get one of those
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T01:53:56.125000+00:00) : compared to bloomington
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T01:53:51.868000+00:00) : IUPUI is a great campus and Indy is a fun place
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T01:53:42.827000+00:00) : you should be excited
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T01:50:47.823000+00:00) : you should take advantage of that stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-08-04T01:48:53.572000+00:00) : its that time of the year again

71716577669550080 (2017-08-03T22:50:37.749000+00:00) : its weird, most of the time when a team gets sponsored i have a hard time adapting to their new name but with c9 it's completely natural
71716577669550080 (2017-08-03T02:44:26.076000+00:00) : <@!125452744440938497> ok lets play a few games

71716577669550080 (2017-08-02T20:37:55.412000+00:00) : the battle pass doesnt expire until the middle of september so you still have time to earn points trhough other methods

71716577669550080 (2017-08-02T19:18:34.351000+00:00) : then in 2024 you'll meet your first child, keenan jr.

71716577669550080 (2017-08-02T14:47:59.126000+00:00) : IDK I might get it for switch and if it has multiplayer that's local wireless instead of split screen it would be fun that way
71716577669550080 (2017-08-02T14:47:06.018000+00:00) : The whole kgb thing was probably the worst thing we've ever done

71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T02:08:33.796000+00:00) : Did you have the day off work?
71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T01:43:15.992000+00:00) : And you need to practice a bit
71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T01:43:07.532000+00:00) : That's my favorite mode
71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T01:42:54.018000+00:00) : But Keenan please play the salmon run tutorials at least
71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T01:36:09.685000+00:00) : It's probably subsided a bit by now
71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T01:35:59.231000+00:00) : I'm glad I avoided ranked for the first week because I heard it's crazy with all the S+ players from the first game trying to get back to their former ranks
71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T01:34:23.767000+00:00) : Which doesn't change the balance that much
71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T01:34:13.171000+00:00) : But your level is no indication of your skill it just allows you access to better gear
71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T01:33:48.568000+00:00) : Most I've seen is +/- 7 levels from myself
71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T01:32:56.701000+00:00) : Nintendo switch online
71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T01:32:23.657000+00:00) : I've never seen anything with so much discrepancy before
71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T01:32:03.687000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T01:30:20.126000+00:00) : I have a pretty high winrate because i played early when no one but Wii u owners and free demo players were experienced
71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T01:29:45.409000+00:00) : :(
71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T01:29:05.621000+00:00) : To make up for it
71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T01:28:55.578000+00:00) : There's no mechanic of holding notes so they do some crazy things with the button combos
71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T01:27:51.998000+00:00) : They make sense after a few tries
71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T01:27:29.646000+00:00) : Also i had about 5-7 hours of the play time on the free weekends
71716577669550080 (2017-07-29T01:26:58.334000+00:00) : Well I'm very experienced at the rhythm game

71716577669550080 (2017-07-28T21:26:59.106000+00:00) : Jeez there's 17 different clothing brands in Splatoon
71716577669550080 (2017-07-28T21:19:34.511000+00:00) : No that was just released today. Got it on Amazon for 10
71716577669550080 (2017-07-28T19:28:13.097000+00:00) : no they just changed their logo and now there's less color variety in the dota 2 scene
71716577669550080 (2017-07-28T19:15:20.183000+00:00) : no more grean teams
71716577669550080 (2017-07-28T19:15:12.439000+00:00) : i cant believe OG got rid of their green logo
71716577669550080 (2017-07-28T17:34:12.865000+00:00) : My physical game soundtrack collection is slowly growing

71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T02:36:17.633000+00:00) : its not my most played
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T02:28:25.303000+00:00) : this is a good stream <@!125452744440938497> https://www.twitch.tv/siractionslacks
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T02:08:43.400000+00:00) : they just like animals a lot
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T02:07:58.427000+00:00) : botw is a furry game

71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T02:07:22.574000+00:00) : no wonder they like sidon so much
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T02:05:37.841000+00:00) : ok i looked at that channel and it's all either zelda or furry stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T01:52:11.926000+00:00) : im sure an rpg like this already exists
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T01:46:51.796000+00:00) : next year there will be a lv 3000 reward for a solid gold block of cheese
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T01:44:23.609000+00:00) : i think roshan is kind of a boring character to have a collectors item of
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T01:44:00.159000+00:00) : http://blog.dota2.com/2017/07/level-2000-collectors-baby-roshan/
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T01:40:42.611000+00:00) : still no vevo level
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T01:38:35.854000+00:00) : where almost everything on the undertale playlist is above 1-2 million views
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T01:38:19.536000+00:00) : most other games only have a few or several standout tracks in terms of popularity
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T01:37:52.175000+00:00) : i think undertale might still be the most popular video game soundtrack overall
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T01:36:39.128000+00:00) : which is probably why
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T01:36:25.436000+00:00) : literally the equivalent of the duck song
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T01:36:04.411000+00:00) : but the magikarp song?
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T01:35:31.240000+00:00) : that one makes sense
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T01:32:06.345000+00:00) : im surprised about those two pokemon songs because the magikarp one is only a month old and the other one iskind of obscure from a new game
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T01:30:20.370000+00:00) : i thought undertale would be first
71716577669550080 (2017-07-26T01:27:00.886000+00:00) : somewhat surprising top 10 songs in my playlist by views

71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:31:23.979000+00:00) : like synderen and ppd and fogged
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:31:16.372000+00:00) : i think they just should have stuck with the established pros
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:30:17.726000+00:00) : ccnc is really smart but he's also literally never casted before
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:29:55.619000+00:00) : and then just get invited anyway
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:29:51.559000+00:00) : they can fail to qualify to ti
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:29:46.391000+00:00) : like players dont even need to work
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:28:54.875000+00:00) : all the talent they didnt invite literally need events to make money
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:28:41.010000+00:00) : those people can make a living playing dota or streaming
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:28:30.449000+00:00) : also they invite so many pros
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:28:04.511000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:26:44.014000+00:00) : or lumi
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:26:41.510000+00:00) : and then they invite pyrion
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:26:37.376000+00:00) : these people work really hard throughout the entire year
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:26:30.312000+00:00) : no grandgrant
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:26:26.993000+00:00) : no lacoste
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:26:07.004000+00:00) : and they snub people like kotlguy who still grinds his ass off even though he already has a prominent place in the scene
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:25:19.261000+00:00) : valve keeps inviting people like lumi and pyrionflax who barely do any dota events the whole year
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:25:02.730000+00:00) : again
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:24:57.881000+00:00) : im very dissappointed with the talent list
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:23:20.502000+00:00) : him getting taught by purge was an elaborate plan this whole time to take over dota
71716577669550080 (2017-07-22T01:23:01.061000+00:00) : day9 hosting ti

71716577669550080 (2017-07-21T00:21:57.620000+00:00) : : )
71716577669550080 (2017-07-21T00:17:29.469000+00:00) : i think ronald should parse the death message even further and make it so each of them is a quote from the monster that killed you
71716577669550080 (2017-07-21T00:15:33.701000+00:00) : what the hell
71716577669550080 (2017-07-21T00:15:27.988000+00:00) : i get screen tearing
71716577669550080 (2017-07-21T00:15:17.178000+00:00) : i do not know why my text editor isnt scrolling at 60 fps
71716577669550080 (2017-07-21T00:11:37.139000+00:00) : i know but this is exposing me to vocabulary that i dont need to be exposed to
71716577669550080 (2017-07-21T00:10:14.057000+00:00) : like apparently i am a "llama badger"
71716577669550080 (2017-07-21T00:10:03.360000+00:00) : i have no clue as to whats a racial slur and whats not in this thing

71716577669550080 (2017-07-20T18:47:06.790000+00:00) : id pay for that
71716577669550080 (2017-07-20T18:46:04.622000+00:00) : they should expand on that
71716577669550080 (2017-07-20T18:45:54.689000+00:00) : his best set is still that wolf one from like 4 years ago
71716577669550080 (2017-07-20T18:44:49.896000+00:00) : maybe he'll get an actual sniper rifle
71716577669550080 (2017-07-20T18:42:09.100000+00:00) : any of the spirits could get cool arcanas
71716577669550080 (2017-07-20T18:41:21.824000+00:00) : which i doubt will even happen
71716577669550080 (2017-07-20T18:41:16.905000+00:00) : the most they will do is tint them green or something
71716577669550080 (2017-07-20T18:41:05.243000+00:00) : which they arent going to do
71716577669550080 (2017-07-20T18:41:02.046000+00:00) : people just want valve to make custom effects for every stealable spell in the game
71716577669550080 (2017-07-20T18:39:25.355000+00:00) : Although most of the best rubick sets we're ultra rares that are way more expensive than an arcana
71716577669550080 (2017-07-20T18:37:50.058000+00:00) : Yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-07-20T18:36:35.502000+00:00) : Sniper has at least two immortals
71716577669550080 (2017-07-20T18:24:31.092000+00:00) : One of these things is not like the other

71716577669550080 (2017-07-19T18:52:48.935000+00:00) : a serverside plugin platform
71716577669550080 (2017-07-19T03:13:09.978000+00:00) : <@!127535721857679362> can you tell me where the server files are located so i can convert it to bukkit

71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:36:42.789000+00:00) : Because the cube is so small we hardly need any rails
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:36:06.554000+00:00) : That connect everything except for Keenan
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:35:49.237000+00:00) : I think we should have overground rails
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:35:11.610000+00:00) : Alright great
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:34:58.935000+00:00) : So I can think about roads and my entrance

71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:32:58.246000+00:00) : Your castle is still hard to access
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:32:49.483000+00:00) : That's not the same
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:32:10.894000+00:00) : Why you can't even get to your castle from my.base Keenan
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:31:08.612000+00:00) : Ronald can I connect with you?
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:30:23.269000+00:00) : Can I at least make it look destroyed in the middle with mossy cobble and vines
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:29:29.117000+00:00) : He does he's just shy about saying it
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:28:30.176000+00:00) : Pls
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:24:48.171000+00:00) : Then it's the cookie factory. You don't want that eithet
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:22:36.876000+00:00) : Then he wins his stability argument
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:22:29.404000+00:00) : We can't have that
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:22:25.790000+00:00) : Destroying it would make Asher's cube the longest standing structure
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:21:46.637000+00:00) : Monument
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:21:41.042000+00:00) : That bridge is a moment
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:21:19.522000+00:00) : And is the oldest standing structure on the map
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:21:08.754000+00:00) : It's a symbol of friendship between two castles
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:20:37.330000+00:00) : Yeah he is that bridge is my most valuable asset to the server
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:19:18.473000+00:00) : I thought you kept falling on purpose
71716577669550080 (2017-07-18T20:17:34.014000+00:00) : I'm really interested in using it as a flying platform

71716577669550080 (2017-07-15T00:44:53.331000+00:00) : its like playing through smb for the first time using warps and then saying you beat the game and never come back to it
71716577669550080 (2017-07-15T00:42:43.660000+00:00) : its just skipping the biggest aspect of any zelda game
71716577669550080 (2017-07-15T00:41:06.295000+00:00) : it would be pretty sad
71716577669550080 (2017-07-15T00:41:02.679000+00:00) : like imagine if ocarina of time let you skip half the dungeons
71716577669550080 (2017-07-15T00:40:45.843000+00:00) : because people can get away without seeing a lot of their designs
71716577669550080 (2017-07-15T00:40:03.661000+00:00) : i wish they didnt make shrines optional
71716577669550080 (2017-07-15T00:38:08.841000+00:00) : dungeons are the core of zelda games
71716577669550080 (2017-07-15T00:36:53.726000+00:00) : you basically only played half the dungeons

71716577669550080 (2017-07-11T03:28:05.359000+00:00) : think of them as just a really really nice speaker that happens to reside near your ear
71716577669550080 (2017-07-11T03:26:54.489000+00:00) : they also dont block out sound if you're looking for that
71716577669550080 (2017-07-11T03:26:14.726000+00:00) : they are nice but apparently they even bleed trhough horror noises
71716577669550080 (2017-07-11T02:36:26.506000+00:00) : the tall version of the echo is a pretty good wireless speaker but if you just wanted a speaker there are better ones for the price
71716577669550080 (2017-07-11T02:35:59.169000+00:00) : and even if so, google has a better ecosystem

71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:56:30.130000+00:00) : theres no real reason to keep duplicates
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:55:52.229000+00:00) : what

71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:45:43.039000+00:00) : its in the middle of the microsoft campus
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:45:31.772000+00:00) : you can see the sign at least
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:45:15.879000+00:00) : i really want to see nintendo too but im 100% sure you cant get any tour or even go inside
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:43:04.431000+00:00) : you should try to do it on thursday
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:35:12.762000+00:00) : im so glad they went back to the regular all-star match format
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:33:47.019000+00:00) : or during the day as well for games we dont care about
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:33:39.013000+00:00) : i think the best time to do stuff other than ti would be the mornings before noon and the evenings
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:30:13.059000+00:00) : ronald when are you leaving on sunday?

71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:16:50.959000+00:00) : i know on the home page when you initially put in the flight criteria there's a promo code box
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:16:07.522000+00:00) : is there a promo code option
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:13:24.504000+00:00) : so the flight departs at 6:50 am in estern time?
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:12:25.699000+00:00) : oh ok
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:12:21.591000+00:00) : this is going to take ages
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:12:17.864000+00:00) : omg i have 75 player card packs to open
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:06:29.891000+00:00) : idk if i'll leave on the same flight or not depends on seats
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:06:20.871000+00:00) : we can probably drive up to the airport together
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:05:54.767000+00:00) : oh ok just wondering
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:04:39.656000+00:00) : there's a 3 hour time difference too so wouldnt you get there at around 7 am
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:03:45.416000+00:00) : leave bloomington that time? or plane departs that time
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:02:42.167000+00:00) : and we could figure it out then
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:02:31.636000+00:00) : if flights really are that busy i might not be able to find one either
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:02:12.230000+00:00) : there's a lot you could do in the meantime
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T01:00:01.590000+00:00) : ok check out is noon
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T00:58:22.680000+00:00) : its like 10 or so blocks away think?
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T00:56:55.448000+00:00) : the place is downtown is within walking distance to the trainline that goes to the airport
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T00:53:16.233000+00:00) : Where would you go lol
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T00:52:53.628000+00:00) : I can check
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T00:52:38.947000+00:00) : Yeah do that
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T00:51:56.373000+00:00) : I might also have to do that if I can get on any flight Sunday
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T00:51:24.086000+00:00) : Is it cheaper to do that and get a hotel?
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T00:50:55.925000+00:00) : You can check other airlines but idk if they'd be different
71716577669550080 (2017-07-07T00:50:24.956000+00:00) : Yeah I think that's what my mom was talking about. Sundays are a really busy day to leave
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T17:10:43.404000+00:00) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaZfZFNuOpI
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T16:59:51.151000+00:00) : https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRsfRHXPTuEXdNvUcI8DzJIU5iazqlpksWucPF0d8l2ztkkA/viewform
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T06:33:56.224000+00:00) : but also a waste of time
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T06:33:50.979000+00:00) : that was cool
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T06:33:40.095000+00:00) : i just watched the entire 4 hour twilight princess speed run
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T06:16:42.841000+00:00) : It's not a big deal if you don't though
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T06:16:33.202000+00:00) : If you can't do it in the config for overviewer you should try in the URL since coords can get passed in there
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T06:15:58.611000+00:00) : Can you set the center to the spawn when we load that page
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T06:04:50.921000+00:00) : I'm not sure
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:33:11.986000+00:00) : are you just wathcing the latest.log file?
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:30:52.601000+00:00) : its a good mechanic but seems pretty hardcore
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:30:05.893000+00:00) : because theres a lot of lava
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:29:56.345000+00:00) : no thats mean
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:29:20.583000+00:00) : besides your texts
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:29:15.936000+00:00) : because since you dont lose items theres no penalty
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:29:08.444000+00:00) : that may actually be a good punishment for dying
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:28:51.206000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:27:36.206000+00:00) : well thats your job
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:27:10.259000+00:00) : anything else we basically already have done
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:26:55.413000+00:00) : what should it be then
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:24:59.054000+00:00) : because otherwise we cant get to the end with our border
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:24:50.261000+00:00) : and to do that we spawn in an end portal
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:24:43.699000+00:00) : i think the first goal should be beating the dragon
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:23:47.541000+00:00) : but getting wings from the end is actually kind of fun
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:23:35.695000+00:00) : maybe mending book for the wings
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:22:19.199000+00:00) : im pretty sure thats it
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:21:17.548000+00:00) : i can generate one
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:21:14.047000+00:00) : dont i just need a public private key pair
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:21:06.713000+00:00) : why
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:19:24.944000+00:00) : oh ok i thought you said every 12 hours
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:18:53.821000+00:00) : you mean you'll update the map twice a day?
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:18:40.345000+00:00) : what do you mean
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:17:30.748000+00:00) : ok good
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:16:30.661000+00:00) : but that file would be like 5 gigs
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:16:22.703000+00:00) : i think at one point i thought about rendering it on my local computer and the using sftp to transfer a compressed file
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:15:55.469000+00:00) : its definitely more than what i had
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:14:50.555000+00:00) : you could google it and see if other people have it take a long time
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:14:32.996000+00:00) : idk
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:14:31.414000+00:00) : maybe it did take a long time
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:14:21.278000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:14:15.012000+00:00) : that makes sense
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:12:53.008000+00:00) : or less
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:12:47.815000+00:00) : maybe it should be about half that for the first time
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:12:40.764000+00:00) : but thats seems really long
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:12:29.807000+00:00) : i cant remember hoiw long it took for me
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:12:11.128000+00:00) : the eta might also not be accurate
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:10:33.191000+00:00) : if you stop the server it might be faster
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:10:11.448000+00:00) : but it definitely takes longer the first time
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T05:10:05.735000+00:00) : i dont think it should take that long
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:21:26.594000+00:00) : but you could just run the bot on the server as well
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:21:16.195000+00:00) : oh i havent looked at it
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:20:36.669000+00:00) : i want to see the source code when it's done
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:20:05.113000+00:00) : with the exception of a few special commands for stopping the server and starting the server
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:19:49.529000+00:00) : and then every message sent by people other than the bot is stuffed to the screen console on the server
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:19:33.704000+00:00) : no you just make the channel a live feed of the console
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:19:14.754000+00:00) : its way easier to manage the server through discord than a website
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:19:00.169000+00:00) : .
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:18:32.995000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:18:27.778000+00:00) : and you can put in commands through there or see the logs
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:18:18.010000+00:00) : i think it would be cool if there was a discord channel that was just the server console directly basically
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:17:35.213000+00:00) : are you just going to text the server commands
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:16:54.673000+00:00) : thanks
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:16:15.808000+00:00) : basically 4d
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:15:55.541000+00:00) : it's adds a whole new dimension to the gaming experience
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:15:39.799000+00:00) : its pretty cool if you think about it
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:15:04.480000+00:00) : someone must have killed me
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:15:00.843000+00:00) : i already got a text
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T04:13:36.146000+00:00) : why was the server closed
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T03:44:31.485000+00:00) : ronald spends 2 hours cooking with his buds
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T03:43:58.729000+00:00) : :()
71716577669550080 (2017-07-06T03:37:18.736000+00:00) : ronald why dont you play
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T20:54:26.045000+00:00) : keenan i finished my ugly farm just for you
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T20:48:00.754000+00:00) : h
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T20:47:59.460000+00:00) : wa
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T20:36:53.088000+00:00) : yeah

71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T20:01:05.617000+00:00) : i think i used something like this script https://github.com/ThomasDepole/Easy-PHP-Tail-/blob/master/tail.php
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T20:00:09.761000+00:00) : im pretty sure that live updates
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T20:00:04.504000+00:00) : are you reading from the latest.log file
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T19:56:54.442000+00:00) : you can add a sleep 15s
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T19:55:34.010000+00:00) : or with cron
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T19:55:28.315000+00:00) : because you can space it out with sleep
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T19:55:20.111000+00:00) : is it all one bash script or separate lines on crontab
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T19:54:42.115000+00:00) : it takes a second for the server to stop
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T19:53:52.040000+00:00) : isnt that a security issue
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T19:52:09.395000+00:00) : cant you just have an object mapping our names to our phone numbers
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T19:51:51.509000+00:00) : i dont think you need a switch
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T19:51:28.759000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T19:49:31.026000+00:00) : cool
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T19:46:05.449000+00:00) : keenaan isnt even playing right now
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T19:02:39.019000+00:00) : then give the number
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T19:02:36.076000+00:00) : go to the console and type seed
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T18:57:35.615000+00:00) : give us the seed
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T18:08:00.134000+00:00) : you arent even online wtf
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:54:45.799000+00:00) : He should be able to get you the seed from his phone
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:54:19.404000+00:00) : Pm him
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:49:19.592000+00:00) : Ronald can give it to you with /seed
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:44:09.909000+00:00) : Maybe it's only funny when it's Russian yelling
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:43:41.293000+00:00) : I've definitely yelled at dota videos before
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:42:50.273000+00:00) : Dota is really popular there
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:39:45.056000+00:00) : Nether
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:39:41.733000+00:00) : We can also access the better and build in a 128x128 area there
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:38:29.800000+00:00) : 128x128
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:38:17.964000+00:00) : What if I just built a giant cobblestone platform in the sky to start a new city
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:37:10.321000+00:00) : Never come back up
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:37:02.032000+00:00) : You should just go underground right away
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:35:52.980000+00:00) : Keenan is going to lose it
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:32:36.455000+00:00) : They are trying to make it more accessible for the younger audience
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:30:40.969000+00:00) : We are going back to our roots
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:30:25.868000+00:00) : This discord was founded on Minecraft servers
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:29:44.997000+00:00) : Yes please
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:28:41.127000+00:00) : No it's not going to get big that fast
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:28:13.902000+00:00) : So it will get more robust
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:28:08.661000+00:00) : We all have to build in the same space
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:28:00.606000+00:00) : It will though
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:27:40.979000+00:00) : Farms and stuff can be central since there's not much space
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:27:15.016000+00:00) : Because I do want to build my own shit too
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:27:06.365000+00:00) : It's fair right
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:26:52.994000+00:00) : Oh well whatever that's what was intended
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:26:18+00:00) : Until stuff is more sustainable
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:26:09.709000+00:00) : It just says we live together and share at the beginning when resources are tight
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:25:34.810000+00:00) : Asher's cube is probably just an incomplete palace
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:25:15.142000+00:00) : Because building takes time
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:25:09.275000+00:00) : Or makes them better
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:23:53.275000+00:00) : Look at the pin
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:23:39.251000+00:00) : Or you know just tp
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:23:28.818000+00:00) : They are pinned
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:23:17.367000+00:00) : Just get the seed
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:22:54.699000+00:00) : No did you read the official rules
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:22:15.986000+00:00) : My house is going to be in the jungle
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:22:03.592000+00:00) : You can build a castle
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:21:02.423000+00:00) : Idk it's a pretty crazy mountain
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:20:13.021000+00:00) : The mountain is at the intersection of three other biomes
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:07:15.262000+00:00) : Hence the first thing I did was make cocoa farm
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:07:03.496000+00:00) : No in realism i would mainly eat cookies
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:06:39.398000+00:00) : It's important to me to have food for realism
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:06:23.330000+00:00) : Apples aren't really farmable fast
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:06:02.486000+00:00) : Melons suck asa food source
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:05:52.999000+00:00) : There aren't really fruits
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:05:01.980000+00:00) : Don't use the jungle corner though
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:04:47.454000+00:00) : Well we don't have much space rn so just pick a corner and make farms there
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:01:52.149000+00:00) : Yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:01:35.016000+00:00) : Ronald was saying that if this is going to be a city and the spawn is the center, farms shouldn't be near the center
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:00:38.490000+00:00) : And build it into some.building
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:00:23.787000+00:00) : I want to hollow out that whole rock though
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T17:00:08.429000+00:00) : So you can move it
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:59:59.348000+00:00) : Everything on that spawn point is temporary
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:59:40.629000+00:00) : You can harvest them but don't break the stems unless you want to replant somewhere
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:58:55.277000+00:00) : A penis color one and a big ass one
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:58:47.139000+00:00) : He actually had two cubes
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:58:29.432000+00:00) : Like he always does
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:58:22.666000+00:00) : Asher can maintain his cube
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:57:53.172000+00:00) : Yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:57:20.195000+00:00) : Idk what Asher's thing is
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:57:10.158000+00:00) : Not Asher's cube
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:57:06.379000+00:00) : Where the spawn is
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:57:00.863000+00:00) : Anything on top of that cube is temporary
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:56:35.657000+00:00) : So don't destroy those either
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:56:28.611000+00:00) : We also had a single melon plant
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:56:01.535000+00:00) : Unfortunately it didn't drop saplings so we are out of jungle wood
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:55:39.471000+00:00) : No we had a single jungle tree with beans
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:55:09.250000+00:00) : By the time to play on Friday it will actually be good
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:54:33.749000+00:00) : You can't just destroy anything you want
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:54:02.986000+00:00) : I'm.being efficient
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:53:58.898000+00:00) : It's not going to be destroyed
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:53:49.092000+00:00) : You only have to breed every once in a while
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:53:36.725000+00:00) : Chickens just grow naturally
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:53:30.655000+00:00) : Fishing takes time away from other things
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:53:04.885000+00:00) : I wanted a source of meat as soon as possible
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:52:57.108000+00:00) : That takes time
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:52:50.633000+00:00) : No some idiot might kill them because they think they respawn
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:52:22.207000+00:00) : Because chickens needed to be perserved
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:52:02.506000+00:00) : I'm not going to wait until I can make a beautiful farm when I needed seeds now
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:51:09.145000+00:00) : You will be challenged when you can't do what you want because you don't have the materials
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:50:21.546000+00:00) : I don't think you even know
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:49:51.208000+00:00) : It's just the starter
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:49:46.305000+00:00) : It's not going to be the real farm
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:49:35.956000+00:00) : It's going to have a natural look when I'm done
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:49:16.951000+00:00) : There's a clear differencd between a nice looking farm and a only stone mountain
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:48:48.148000+00:00) : Do you even understand Minecraft
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:48:42.897000+00:00) : Fountain takes only stone to make
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:48:30.113000+00:00) : It takes a while
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:48:26.215000+00:00) : The farm wasn't going to be completed until I got enough seeds
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:48:11.116000+00:00) : You're wrong dude there are a lot of limited resources
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:47:30.862000+00:00) : I played for 1 hour
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:47:19.097000+00:00) : It will take time
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:47:08.481000+00:00) : This is a challenge map
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:47:01.145000+00:00) : I don't see how it can not be
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:45:49.480000+00:00) : It doesn't matter I still wanted to preserve the animals as soon as possible because we could lose them forever
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:45:19.047000+00:00) : They are persistent and only grow with breeding
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:45:08.777000+00:00) : They made that change a very long time ago with the new biomes
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:44:51.010000+00:00) : Animals don't respawn
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:44:40.256000+00:00) : They can
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:44:18.750000+00:00) : Idk what that is
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:44:04.421000+00:00) : Don't have carrots or potatoes
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:43:54.942000+00:00) : Can't breed pigs
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:43:40.887000+00:00) : Sort a time dependent thing
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:43:28.250000+00:00) : Because if all the chickens died we wouldn't have any meat
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:43:04.463000+00:00) : Needed seeds to bread the chickens
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:42:46.282000+00:00) : Because I wanted to start the farm  fast
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:42:13.383000+00:00) : So I needed to make it near water
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:42:07.026000+00:00) : You have to consider we didn't have iron when I made that farm
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:41:33.329000+00:00) : And the farm isn't complete dummy
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:41:22.576000+00:00) : The bridge is my beautiful boy
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:41:16.255000+00:00) : I haven't seen the cube
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:41:01.794000+00:00) : The dirt hut?
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:40:58.487000+00:00) : Like what
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:40:38.802000+00:00) : We do enough for me not to build anything out of it right now
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:40:15.958000+00:00) : And no wool
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:40:11.527000+00:00) : And no glass
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:40:00.937000+00:00) : And iron
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:39:58.357000+00:00) : We have very limited amount of wood
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:39:50.370000+00:00) : What do you expect a beautiful mansion
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:06:33.433000+00:00) : Yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:05:35.906000+00:00) : That's a pretty major game
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:05:24.876000+00:00) : We also haven't beaten Minecraft yet
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:05:16.552000+00:00) : No keenan
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:05:09.573000+00:00) : That's a lot of whole days
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:04:55.248000+00:00) : Common stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T16:04:42.799000+00:00) : Anytime someone leaves for a week you risk this happening to you
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T15:59:31.038000+00:00) : It's going to be ugly at the beginning
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T15:59:07.138000+00:00) : Wow
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T15:59:05.278000+00:00) : There's a bridge and a dirt hut
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T15:57:51.214000+00:00) : It's actually impossible to find a better spawn
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T15:57:05.461000+00:00) : We found a spawn too good
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T15:56:25.777000+00:00) : You seemed fine playing without asher on the ftb map
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T05:33:45.490000+00:00) : You should do something with PayPal or venmo so that everytime we die we lose 50 cents
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T05:32:58.173000+00:00) : Because that would v really encouraged me not to die
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T05:32:32.995000+00:00) : Yeah but are you actually going to set that up
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T04:11:59.920000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T04:11:50.473000+00:00) : <@!127535721857679362> ronald are you literally going to sms us when we die
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T02:55:21.881000+00:00) : but theres a chance something like that already exists for minecraft and discord integration
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T02:55:09.773000+00:00) : would be a lot of programming
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T02:55:05.905000+00:00) : you could do that
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:49:33.735000+00:00) : you're hurting me
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:48:40.683000+00:00) : use the command screen -S screenname stuff "/stop\n"
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:47:03.090000+00:00) : its not the proper way to close the server
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:46:48.418000+00:00) : because its bad
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:46:31.427000+00:00) : yeah dont do that
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:46:18.650000+00:00) : you need to send the command stop to the screen instance
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:46:09.102000+00:00) : yes
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:45:36.679000+00:00) : but there should be logs
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:44:41.907000+00:00) : are you stopping the server with "stop"
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:44:32.466000+00:00) : isnt there a logs folder
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:44:26.672000+00:00) : yeah it should
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:44:15.733000+00:00) : but do you mean in real time and then putting it on a webserver?
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:44:07.429000+00:00) : i think it creates logs automatically
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:43:46.483000+00:00) : im changing my minecraft settings
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:41:43.591000+00:00) : we going to fly

71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:40:22.131000+00:00) : <@!125452744440938497> <@!155893986605793281>
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:40:10.320000+00:00) : LETS DO THIS
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:40:08.510000+00:00) : ASHER COME
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:38:05.033000+00:00) : also i th ink i found a good spawn
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:37:58.045000+00:00) : well im online now so it should work
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:26:36.820000+00:00) : OP ME
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:26:30.528000+00:00) : <@!127535721857679362> RONAAAALD
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:14:36.745000+00:00) : Let asher log on and try to op him
71716577669550080 (2017-07-05T00:00:11.886000+00:00) : It just let's me use admin commands to set the spawn and world border
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:59:52.431000+00:00) : In the server console type op mango_mac
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:59:30.526000+00:00) : So I can do it with asher
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:59:23.558000+00:00) : Then just make me op
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:59:06.248000+00:00) : When I come on in a bit we can fly around and find a good spawn
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:58:52.203000+00:00) : No
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:58:43.306000+00:00) : It's bad to store raw folders
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:58:35.932000+00:00) : But I would still compress it
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:58:30.104000+00:00) : You can try it
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:57:35.139000+00:00) : Also aren't all versions of the folder still stored locally somewhere
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:57:09.249000+00:00) : Does git have unlimited storage?
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:56:44.951000+00:00) : Lol that sounds a little strange
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:56:19.657000+00:00) : I spaced them out by like 5 minutes though because I needed to do more steps to render the map
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:55:52.680000+00:00) : It should be fine to backup while the server is running
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:54:36.575000+00:00) : We want our job to run at 5 A.M., which would be minute 0, hour 5, every day of the month, every month, every day of the week. We need to add a line to the bottom of the file which looks like this:

0 5 * * * /home/myname/scripts/do-every-day.sh
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:53:09.870000+00:00) : Actually nevermind it's reveresed
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:51:56.965000+00:00) : I think
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:51:52.640000+00:00) : * * * 5 *
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:49:49.226000+00:00) : In an hour. You should help
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:44:50.058000+00:00) : The only reason for saving old backups is if you wanted to make a time lapse or something
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:44:25.484000+00:00) : You can also just manually delete old stuff every week
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:43:10.186000+00:00) : You basically just provide a list of times and the corresponding path of the script you want to run at that time
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:41:58.500000+00:00) : Tis really easy to use
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:41:51.493000+00:00) : No cron is just a different program
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:39:52.287000+00:00) : So the screen has to be named the same thing everytime
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:39:35.878000+00:00) : Cron is separate from screen but in order to stop the server you need to send a stop command to the screen instance
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:39:07.393000+00:00) : What do you mean
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:35:37.139000+00:00) : I do still have my scripts for that
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:33:33.657000+00:00) : Because restarting sometimes helps fix bugs and shit so it's good to do it everyday
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:33:09.811000+00:00) : And then run thkse every day as well
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:32:58.093000+00:00) : I would write simple bash script that you can run to stop and start the server through the screen
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:32:28.060000+00:00) : Ronald you are using screens right?
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:31:56.066000+00:00) : IT just ruins your internet for everyone else in the house though
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:31:40.757000+00:00) : It's pretty easy to set up if you really want to
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:31:05.214000+00:00) : Why can't we stream it on twitch
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:30:21.225000+00:00) : Asher the fuck house needs a spawn point first
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:30:00.729000+00:00) : They each were compressed tar files with the date of the backup in file name
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:28:56.271000+00:00) : No I put the backups in a new folder called backups but it was located on the same instance
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:28:09.766000+00:00) : Yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:27:59.583000+00:00) : The world folder
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:27:43.287000+00:00) : And also restarted the server at that time
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:27:33.496000+00:00) : And then I ran the bash script every day at 5 am
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:27:15.024000+00:00) : So backups wouldn't override each other
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:27:04.104000+00:00) : I put it in a bash script that inserted the current date into the new file name
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:26:44.445000+00:00) : I think the command is tar -zcf targetworld/ new/path.tar
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:25:07.682000+00:00) : And saved backups to a separate folder as tar zips
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:24:56.556000+00:00) : I just used a cron job to run a simple tar coand every morning at 5 am
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:24:32.943000+00:00) : No but their recommended method is probably better
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:24:12.808000+00:00) : Are you following the official Google cloud Minecraft server guide
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:22:37.953000+00:00) : His diamond script works
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:22:33.052000+00:00) : Fuck he did it.
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:21:42.493000+00:00) : You don't even have the same excuse as Ronald I can see the discord icon right there
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:21:01.510000+00:00) : Why didn't you take a screenshot
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:20:55.882000+00:00) : Asher
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:15:37.960000+00:00) : In our 4 player mmo
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:15:31.641000+00:00) : That's the role you play
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:15:25.992000+00:00) : You are going to be the criminal throughout the whole server
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:14:53.915000+00:00) : Well it's too late for that
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:13:45.734000+00:00) : It's not going to be hard to catch if we all live in the same 64 chunks
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:11:40.176000+00:00) : He has to look up how to turn on cheats
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:10:47.637000+00:00) : We don't have the spawn
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:10:42.035000+00:00) : Asher don't play yet
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:08:59.084000+00:00) : We could make it 128x128 so that it's exactly 64 chunks
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:07:50.121000+00:00) : I mean we would just all get banned
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:02:22.476000+00:00) : I like the idea of a finite amount
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T23:02:15.652000+00:00) : I actually think we shouldn't expand until all the resources are gone
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:59:43.060000+00:00) : We'll be able to tell if all the diamonds are gone in our little square
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:59:15.134000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:58:58.680000+00:00) : Should we do the game rule where theres no inventory loss on death again
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:58:07.159000+00:00) : Lol
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:57:00.403000+00:00) : But idk if I'll remember
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:56:49.938000+00:00) : Cool I can try to find the plugins I used for that
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:56:08.017000+00:00) : It uses a lot of space
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:55:56.577000+00:00) : Most people say more than that but I don't care
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:55:46.104000+00:00) : You should back it up once a day
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:55:13.931000+00:00) : Cool
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:54:59.638000+00:00) : Ronald did you make it static ?
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:54:41.896000+00:00) : I think 150x150 might be good
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:54:22.692000+00:00) : We can expand it every day or week
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:52:02.478000+00:00) : Yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:50:47.057000+00:00) : I think like 100-200 initially
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:49:58.254000+00:00) : Like what width
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:49:37.083000+00:00) : What do we want to set the square border as
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:48:28.311000+00:00) : You make me op and I'll do it
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:48:19.883000+00:00) : We can play tonight Ronald
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:48:09.297000+00:00) : Yes
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:47:33.839000+00:00) : It will be late there though
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:47:13.724000+00:00) : Yeah I'll let you confirm
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:46:32.751000+00:00) : When I get home today I can set up the spawn and the world border
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:43:57.639000+00:00) : I'm not playing a confined world border world with a shitty spawn
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:43:25.446000+00:00) : Make sure  <@155893986605793281> picks out a good spawn
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:38:21.327000+00:00) : This is what I used. Make sure to install the jdk step too
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:38:07.742000+00:00) : https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-get-on-debian-8
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:37:03.086000+00:00) : Other people won't care but I just won't play otherwise
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:36:24.489000+00:00) : Yes very
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:35:38.958000+00:00) : Hold on
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:34:12.443000+00:00) : You just have to add the repo to the package manager first
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:33:51.991000+00:00) : I installed Java 8 just fine took me 5 minutes
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:33:35.323000+00:00) : Fuck no
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:28:25.390000+00:00) : <@127535721857679362> Ronald after a year could you just activate another year or do they expire before then
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:27:20.130000+00:00) : The blue haired girl you are talking about wasn't available to marry when i played
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:26:41.679000+00:00) : But in a replay I would probably marry Abigail because her cutscenes involve gaming
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:26:20.938000+00:00) : Oh her name is Leah
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:26:11.767000+00:00) : Asher she was the red haired person at the South exit of the farm
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:25:23.763000+00:00) : Why would you do whitelist lol
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T22:24:09.784000+00:00) : I forgot the name of the person i married
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:26:46.795000+00:00) : and then set the world border around that area
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:26:28.527000+00:00) : i think we should fly around in creative and  find a good spawn before starting
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:16:24.419000+00:00) : and change all the settings without remembering the flags
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:15:55.175000+00:00) : because you can save different profiles easily
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:15:33.812000+00:00) : yeah but there are certain features that putty simplifies which is nice
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:14:37.160000+00:00) : with that much ram you could probably allocate 3gb to minecraft and still use the instance to do other things
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:14:05.064000+00:00) : they make the most difference when there are lots of players and they are spread out
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:13:54.709000+00:00) : well ssds are probably faster but i think for us it wont make much of a difference
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:12:24.556000+00:00) : i just googled it
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:12:17.979000+00:00) : i think hdds are fine
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:11:39.078000+00:00) : oh im not sure if that's worth it
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:11:18.532000+00:00) : because if it was ssd i think the world woudl load faster
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:11:02.733000+00:00) : does changing it to ssd change the price?
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:10:22.673000+00:00) : he probably doesnt have discord on his mac
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:10:04.270000+00:00) : yeah if it doesnt change the price
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:09:57.700000+00:00) : i wonder if when one year runs out you could activate another year
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:09:39.059000+00:00) : it's valuable shit
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:09:20.809000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:07:48.824000+00:00) : we wont ever have more than 6 concurrent players
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:07:01.879000+00:00) : im pretty sure for vanilla i got away with 3.5 total with 3 allocated to minecraft
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:06:35.575000+00:00) : yes
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:06:33+00:00) : for a heavily modded server yes
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:06:14.340000+00:00) : i dont think it's necessary
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:06:07.031000+00:00) : thats a lot of ram
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:05:58.069000+00:00) : the old map was replaced every night but it's still 5gb
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:05:17.722000+00:00) : it was
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:04:59.160000+00:00) : last time the map files took up like 5 gigabytes
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:04:39.612000+00:00) : we'll only have storage issues at 10gb if we want to have a live map
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:02:44.653000+00:00) : i owould also make sure to select a persistent ssd disk instead of hdd because i dont think it costs extra if it's lesss than 50gb
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:01:48.711000+00:00) : i think it was 2 or 3
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:01:41.599000+00:00) : i cant remember what i did for vanilla last time
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T21:01:34.496000+00:00) : for the FTB server i used 4.5 gb instance with 4gb of allocated ram
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T20:59:50.074000+00:00) : command blocks are a way of scripting within minecraft
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T20:59:21.546000+00:00) : http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/World_border
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T20:58:54.573000+00:00) : no it's a built in command
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T20:58:44.400000+00:00) : it is since it can be done with command blocks
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T20:58:05.317000+00:00) : because we never do
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T20:58:02.055000+00:00) : i like the idea of forcing us to all live near each other
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T20:57:34.498000+00:00) : like have an expanding world border with command blocks
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T20:57:26.446000+00:00) : if we are going to do vanilla i at least want to play it in a somewhat different style than our normal servers
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T20:53:39.383000+00:00) : i will
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T20:52:14.505000+00:00) : but i might play an hour of it every night instead of dota
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T20:52:04.586000+00:00) : so idk how much i will play it
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T20:51:56.479000+00:00) : i have a lot of other games i kind of want to play first
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T20:51:45.076000+00:00) : we could
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T20:50:56.978000+00:00) : the guy speed running banjo right now is basically a TAS machine
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T20:27:40.581000+00:00) : ok
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T20:26:38.671000+00:00) : earth isnt infinite like minecraft is
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T20:26:24.707000+00:00) : minecraft is technically better than reality
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T16:08:41.328000+00:00) : Holy shit iceiceice is streaming
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T15:23:09.611000+00:00) : That's what Xenoblade does to me
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T00:16:16.818000+00:00) : new patch pogchamp
71716577669550080 (2017-07-04T00:14:25.668000+00:00) : sure
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T23:16:39.891000+00:00) : So your three interests are cannons turtles and pineapples
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T23:14:49.080000+00:00) : The fuck
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T23:07:51.317000+00:00) : Regardless of how many points you have
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T23:07:39.849000+00:00) : But you can't be invited if you changed after the roster lock
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T23:06:49.861000+00:00) : So doing that is only worth it if you perform at tI and all the events leading up to it
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T23:06:12.850000+00:00) : Yeah but also the roster lock happens a decent amount of time before TI itself
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T23:03:18.327000+00:00) : The other thing is that SA and CIS are officially separate regions now
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T23:02:17.194000+00:00) : I think the only way a team would get players with varying points is through shuffles
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T23:01:22.960000+00:00) : Yeah because it just seems like the amount of points you earn will be a factor of placement, proximity to TI, and total prize pool
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T22:58:03.984000+00:00) : Yeah in theory that would work but I still think it's risky to do that because you need to also work well together and have teamwork
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T22:46:28.547000+00:00) : I guess we will directly be able to see the best players and teams based on QP
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T22:36:09.074000+00:00) : <@125452744440938497> <@127535721857679362> Wow valve is completely changing competitive dota. http://blog.dota2.com/2017/07/the-2017-2018-competitive-season/

71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T18:35:13.977000+00:00) : yeah a lot of times you dont even see the hosts

71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T18:30:03.663000+00:00) : lol i'll ask
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T18:29:51.127000+00:00) : which is really useful
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T18:29:44.569000+00:00) : also that place comes with 4 bikes
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T18:29:29.307000+00:00) : they could easily find someone else
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T18:29:21.284000+00:00) : i think it's too high in demand right now
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T18:27:31.167000+00:00) : we could only do that if we had a bible to put between us
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T18:26:32.094000+00:00) : im pretty sure in new york you roomed with nikhil
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T18:26:23.454000+00:00) : did we do that
71716577669550080 (2017-07-03T18:25:34.569000+00:00) : i know we all dont care where we sleep but it just seems really small for 5 people

71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T03:59:10.795000+00:00) : i dont listen to asmr so i cant tell if this video is actual asmr or a parody of it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T03:55:17.442000+00:00) : ASMR
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T03:55:12.053000+00:00) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRO-q5SijCc
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:47:34.876000+00:00) : i wonder which one it will be
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:47:13.766000+00:00) : if dc loses i'll just root for whatever team bulba ends up coaching
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:42:56.511000+00:00) : it's his cheeks
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:42:12.117000+00:00) : yeah they have a really good balance of memes/entertainment and serious casting
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:39:44.444000+00:00) : top 3 ti but then literally nothing else
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:39:35.822000+00:00) : well yeah but he's a weird situation
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:38:07.305000+00:00) : hasnt been there since ti4
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:38:02.553000+00:00) : but it would be really cool to see mason at ti
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:37:53.718000+00:00) : even though not really
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:37:47.789000+00:00) : i consider abed and mason new blood
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:37:28.013000+00:00) : and part of the reason for that is because they havent been to lans but still
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:36:19.796000+00:00) : especially when you compare them to all the great personalities on the other teams
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:36:09.503000+00:00) : so freedom has this great drive and motivation and stuff but i really don't like any of the players on that team
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:34:15.217000+00:00) : those two need to be on better teams
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:34:07.957000+00:00) : and even though i dislike complexity, I still would feel really bad for demon and moo as well
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:32:27.239000+00:00) : or the other half mvp in forev and dubu
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:32:16.650000+00:00) : it's cool to see new blood but i also think it will be a weird ti without some of the players on planet odd like misery
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:31:05.725000+00:00) : obviously im glad np won but they definitely didnt look at solid as freedom
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:30:20.750000+00:00) : yeah that is very true
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:29:11.348000+00:00) : thats more than winning at most lans these days
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:29:03.439000+00:00) : if you think about it, this is probably double elim because the winner automatically gets like 60k
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:27:20.168000+00:00) : then first of playoffs was qualified and second of playoffs was wildcard
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:27:00.110000+00:00) : by being top of group
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:26:55.561000+00:00) : secret qualified the same way
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:26:49.733000+00:00) : they totally did last ti
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:25:49.715000+00:00) : yeah literally every qualifier it's been this format
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:13:15.665000+00:00) : it just started late because of tiebreakers
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T02:13:10.087000+00:00) : i hasnt been very long
71716577669550080 (2017-06-29T00:24:26.740000+00:00) : Holy fuck BTS just baited everyone so hard
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T21:51:31.835000+00:00) : k
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T19:25:45.275000+00:00) : this game is hilarious
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T19:25:38.325000+00:00) : teamfight where no one died
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T19:24:48.586000+00:00) : *4 rapiers
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T19:24:20.099000+00:00) : 2nd longest dota game
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T19:17:25.116000+00:00) : thers an invincible queen of pain
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T19:02:08.376000+00:00) : this is hilarious empire has 5 level 5 dagons and they cant kill anyone
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T19:00:00.179000+00:00) : and it's a complete stalemate
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T18:59:31.248000+00:00) : <@!125452744440938497> this vega vs empire game is past 100 minutes and vega have been defending against megas for the past 50 minutes
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T14:35:51.724000+00:00) : lol at least they postponed till today
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T07:19:57.239000+00:00) : i havent been caught up with the last few episodes
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T07:19:48.612000+00:00) : after this season?
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T07:19:45.686000+00:00) : really?
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T02:54:24.445000+00:00) : thursday i think
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T02:53:42.501000+00:00) : if you want to use the discount you might want to wait to see if keenan is going so you can use it together
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T02:47:31.225000+00:00) : i feel like there will be a break before the next important na games
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T02:47:19.337000+00:00) : do you want to play dota?
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T02:45:17.874000+00:00) : i cant believe they are streaming sea next
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T02:43:33.840000+00:00) : cant beat infinitely scaling heroes
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T02:19:19.360000+00:00) : there's still like 4 more games plus probably tiebreakers
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T02:19:03.746000+00:00) : the NA teams are going to be up so late
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T02:10:29.582000+00:00) : at almost 80 minutes
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T02:10:26.497000+00:00) : <@!125452744440938497> the np / planet odd game is basically a stalemate right now
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T01:29:52.588000+00:00) : actually im fine with cheering for planet odd too
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T01:28:35.005000+00:00) : or liquid
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T01:28:24.406000+00:00) : otherwise i'll have to cheer for eg
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T01:28:22.641000+00:00) : im hoping at least np will make it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T01:25:47.550000+00:00) : this is a disaster
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T01:25:44.738000+00:00) : fuck they did
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T01:24:16.248000+00:00) : are they top seed?
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T01:24:12.235000+00:00) : did np lose to freedom too?
71716577669550080 (2017-06-28T00:13:53.932000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T17:15:55.127000+00:00) : https://twitter.com/tobyfox/status/879726521338003456
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:41:15.714000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:37:10.587000+00:00) : ronald we can play competitive tetris
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:34:33.395000+00:00) : that's two moms at once
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:34:27.452000+00:00) : and henry's mom
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:34:22.735000+00:00) : you can hang out with my mom
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:33:42.814000+00:00) : there's no way he wont if you're coming
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:33:12.699000+00:00) : we will whenever keenan confirms
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:32:44.265000+00:00) : you'll also get to play my switch
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:32:35.833000+00:00) : cool
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:24:38.259000+00:00) : without tickets
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:24:27.617000+00:00) : and watch outside on the giant projector
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:24:20.149000+00:00) : you can also probably visit the secret shop though
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:23:30.295000+00:00) : yes
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:23:00.746000+00:00) : the weekend is twice as much probably because more happens and it's more in demand
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:22:44.225000+00:00) : yeah midweek are 100
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:22:32.938000+00:00) : it's the most eventful two days though
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:22:18.335000+00:00) : it's also 200 dollars for the weekend ticket so if you only want to go saturday that'd probably not be worth it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:19:13.538000+00:00) : it's friday and saturday
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:18:12.512000+00:00) : but seattle is where all the companies that i actually use are
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:18:05.821000+00:00) : california is where all the companies are
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:17:41.134000+00:00) : thats also half the reason im going
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:17:24.311000+00:00) : yeah i really want to live/work in seattle
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:14:13.681000+00:00) : probably
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:13:55.798000+00:00) : idk
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:12:28.724000+00:00) : because it's like 4 months away
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:12:21.664000+00:00) : you mean why do i not know

71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:06:33.482000+00:00) : It's a lot closer
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:06:06.488000+00:00) : I think that's pretty good
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:05:00.376000+00:00) : He could also use 20% discount
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T05:04:36.942000+00:00) : Idk ask asher

71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T04:54:51.014000+00:00) : Well duh you have to account for the cost of the ink cartridge
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T04:53:20.635000+00:00) : We can provide you with basically no lag for only 99.99
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T04:52:55.345000+00:00) : Tired of your pencil lagging?
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T04:52:30.240000+00:00) : I just like "real problems...answered."
71716577669550080 (2017-06-27T04:51:18.360000+00:00) : No lag writing

71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T21:29:23.912000+00:00) : Plus if Keenan ndoesnt go you could buy our extra ticket
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T21:29:10.975000+00:00) : Yeah but we could still hang out at nights
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T21:15:43.905000+00:00) : Even if TI somehow gets cancelled I would still go as to not waste your plane tickets
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T21:13:08.122000+00:00) : Well considering Asher and I each have $300 invested already in tickets,pretty sure
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T21:10:10.088000+00:00) : For everyone else it can be more definitive if they buy tickets
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T21:09:38.387000+00:00) : Ideally but for me it depends on flights since I'm flying standby
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T21:09:03.659000+00:00) : Sunday
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T21:08:15.022000+00:00) : I'd want to leave Sunday
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T21:08:09.502000+00:00) : You generally can't fly west to east in the evening

71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T20:24:36.496000+00:00) : it's so weird to see a snes get it's very first release in 2017
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T20:24:16.895000+00:00) : lol what if star fox 2 wins some award for 2017
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T18:50:12.552000+00:00) : http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/248/336/7f5.gif
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T18:46:45.425000+00:00) : Someone needs to make a new image of the ds printing money except with kimishima instead
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T18:42:58.266000+00:00) : Nintendo is going to make so much money this year
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T18:02:34.139000+00:00) : Which makes them a collector's item
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T18:02:26.017000+00:00) : Also they announced that as of now they are only shipping these through the end of 2017
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T17:59:23.168000+00:00) : I don't see why they would be scaled down
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T17:58:12.108000+00:00) : Well the European nintendo division NERD is likely the one making the emulator and they have a good track record since the NES classic emulator was very good
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T17:56:53.299000+00:00) : But I'm wondering if it's worse or better
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T17:56:35.097000+00:00) : Well I know
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T17:55:57.434000+00:00) : The get slightly different games but in a prettier console
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T17:55:43.176000+00:00) : I wonder if it's worth it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T17:54:40.381000+00:00) : Actually what if the European localization of games is very different
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T17:52:53.790000+00:00) : But if I did that I would have to wait 6 days
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T17:52:40.806000+00:00) : It looks better too
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T17:52:31.146000+00:00) : You can preorder the European one on Amazon right now
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T17:48:30.984000+00:00) : That's because you're too cool and already own these games
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T17:46:59.563000+00:00) : Ik but I was hoping it would be right there in my mini
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T17:36:09.903000+00:00) : New artwork
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T17:36:03.404000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T16:50:31.810000+00:00) : I'm kind of sad theres no Chrono trigger or dkc2 because I really wanted to play those but the rest is top notch
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T16:45:12.755000+00:00) : LINE UP WITH ME
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T16:41:38.041000+00:00) : Keenan we are going to start lining up 5 hours before midnight right
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T16:38:34.780000+00:00) : Holy fuck I'm so excited
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T16:38:26.158000+00:00) : It comes with the unreleased star fox 2
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T16:37:08.272000+00:00) : Snes classic
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T16:37:04.473000+00:00) : <@155893986605793281>
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T16:37:01.715000+00:00) : <@155893986605793281>
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T16:36:56.750000+00:00) : Holy fuck
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T15:45:01.929000+00:00) : It depends if Ronald and Keenan come and if I can find adequate 5.5 person housing
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T15:44:33.706000+00:00) : Yes my mom and her friend might also be coming but it's uncertain if they'll still come if Ronald and Keenan do. Because their main idea was to split costs while also hanging out in Seattle and doing their own thing
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T15:31:41.018000+00:00) : <@125452744440938497> make sure you read the earlier stuff because it concerns you
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T15:31:41.007000+00:00) : <@125452744440938497> make sure you read the earlier stuff because it concerns you
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:38:20.108000+00:00) : Yeah it's so late where you are
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:37:13.499000+00:00) : But you don't really need that if you aren't gaming or aren't doing deep learning stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:36:56.739000+00:00) : I like the surface book simply because it can get really high specced with dedicated graphics and everything
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:35:44.768000+00:00) : I really like how there's no bezels but every laptop manufacturer is starting to do that now
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:34:10.909000+00:00) : i think i asked him that but there was some reason why he couldnt
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:33:58.336000+00:00) : im not sure
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:33:52.380000+00:00) : and roger got his about the same time
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:33:45.667000+00:00) : but nikhil didn't get the top of the line one and he bought it senior year of high school
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:33:17.380000+00:00) : he can only use it while plugged in
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:33:09.160000+00:00) : i think nikhil had to get his repaired and roger's didn't hold a battery charge after a year
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:32:43.394000+00:00) : nikhil and roger both had one but they both broke after a couple of years
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:31:29.747000+00:00) : because it's not goingto be the most powerful or most price efficient
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:30:56.558000+00:00) : like i would basically be buying a macbook for the operating system and high quality hardware alone
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:30:06.825000+00:00) : the other prpblem is that it's hard for me to justify buying a mac when similar priced windows laptops are way more value spec-wise
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:28:29.094000+00:00) : desktop for games and everyything else
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:28:22.625000+00:00) : laptop for coding and browing internet
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:28:07.636000+00:00) : yeah thats pretty much what my laptop/desktop workflow is like
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:27:27.323000+00:00) : running linux on a custom built desktop would bea  lot easier
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:27:11.977000+00:00) : at least on my dell ultrabook
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:26:58.948000+00:00) : it works but it's not perfect
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:26:54.487000+00:00) : it probably feels about the same as running ubuntu on a windows machine
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:26:28.260000+00:00) : you lack a lot of the same drivers
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:26:20.167000+00:00) : you can but it's not an ideal experience
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:25:02.932000+00:00) : and it's inferior and slow
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:24:56.151000+00:00) : but for research i use office a lot and it's always on my lab comptuers which are iMacs
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:24:37.614000+00:00) : i do for minor stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:24:12.548000+00:00) : the other problem with a macbook is that i hate using the microsoft office suite on it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:22:18.684000+00:00) : i want something more permanent
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:21:33.721000+00:00) : i really want to invest in a home server that i can just keep running 24/7 and ssh in whenever i need
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:21:05.463000+00:00) : true but my only real cloudspace is silo and i dont have sudo permissions there
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:20:18.022000+00:00) : it was useful
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:20:06.534000+00:00) : i used it a ton a year ago for a bunch of python programming
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:19:46.049000+00:00) : but im too lazy to switch to it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:19:34.014000+00:00) : i already have a linux partition
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:18:48.169000+00:00) : but yeah some times programming on my pc is frustrating
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:18:18.927000+00:00) : which kind of sucks
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:18:15.162000+00:00) : well you also use windows 8
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:17:42.505000+00:00) : im actually considering a macbook for my next computer because i like unix a lot better for programming
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:16:30.516000+00:00) : then i could play tiny wings
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:16:03.072000+00:00) : what i just got an iphone
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:15:26.969000+00:00) : 😦
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:14:53.906000+00:00) : i want them to go back to the nexus price point
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:14:46.241000+00:00) : i want to see the next pixel
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:14:15.042000+00:00) : my brother has a 3T and it's pretty nice
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:10:49.025000+00:00) : i feel like id rather get a 400 dollar phone every two years than an 800 dollar one every four years
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:10:04.164000+00:00) : im probably never going to buy one though  unless the price goes down substantially
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:09:33.406000+00:00) : cool i want to see it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:08:19.281000+00:00) : <:armboy:307590740496875531>

71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:06:59.313000+00:00) : holy shit ronald
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:06:21.641000+00:00) : how many hours do you have to play

71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:04:54.344000+00:00) : do you want to play shadows of valentia or are you just going to stick with fates
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T07:04:01.236000+00:00) : when are you leaving keenan

71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:58:21.494000+00:00) : i feel like i know the 12am-3am animal crossing themes way too intimately
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:56:52.507000+00:00) : you're missing out
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:56:10.873000+00:00) : you should get the chrome extension that plays the corresponding hour of animal crossing music based on the current time
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:55:13.593000+00:00) : why not the shopping one
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:54:53.692000+00:00) : i guess i better finally sit down for an hour and watch it

71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:52:24.626000+00:00) : to be media you just need to scan a business card
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:52:13.182000+00:00) : oh to be an exhibitor you have to have an actual company and shit
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:51:20.628000+00:00) : not if we make a game in a month
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:50:49.348000+00:00) : which one do you think is easier
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:50:42.272000+00:00) : we'd have to register as media or exhibitors to go

71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:45:04.535000+00:00) : amazon and google use their pro machine learning techniques to tell you stuff about the movie or show as it's playing

71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:28:43.433000+00:00) : thats porbably not acceptable either by hotel standards
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:28:11.896000+00:00) : a hotel could maybe be cheaper if we do it like that
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:28:01.450000+00:00) : yeah it's anywhere from 2-6 people
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:26:31.327000+00:00) : i dont care who sleeps on the bed but i mean is that considered acceptable by airbnb renting people
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:25:55.510000+00:00) : is that acceptable
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:25:45.766000+00:00) : do you think we could get a 1 bed air bnb and eveyone sleep on the floor
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:23:43.350000+00:00) : ok
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:23:33.146000+00:00) : i need to know who's buying tickets so i can sell them otherwise
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:23:17.673000+00:00) : anyway you guys should decide what you're doing in a couple days
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:20:24.592000+00:00) : i just lost a dota game very badly because i spent the whole time talking in discord
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:19:22.364000+00:00) : but ive seen his mom a lot
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:19:18.729000+00:00) : havent seen him since he graduated
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:19:02.621000+00:00) : i have no idea what henry looks like
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:18:02.993000+00:00) : it's his mom
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:18:01.071000+00:00) : no you remember henry herring
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:17:10.971000+00:00) : it probably has to be the same flight
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:15:38.181000+00:00) : like if you and asher bought your tickets together you woudl both get 20% off
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:15:27.379000+00:00) : i also think multiple people can use my 20% airline ticket discount if they buy their tickets together
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:13:53.214000+00:00) : my mom and her friend also might be interested in going because they wanted to hang out in seattle too so we could also room with them to make things really cheap
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:12:57.704000+00:00) : very likely air bnb but it wasnt decided yet because we were still unsure who was going
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:09:14.395000+00:00) : that will cut a lot of costs
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:09:06.301000+00:00) : good idea
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:08:26.951000+00:00) : where is it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:07:33.263000+00:00) : you would have to travel
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:07:27.614000+00:00) : where is it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:06:30.013000+00:00) : i would go to that too if i didnt have to miss many classes
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:06:07.610000+00:00) : when's pax
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:04:10.074000+00:00) : paying 100 dollars to see a billionaire is a pretty good deal
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:03:10.402000+00:00) : sandals and all
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:03:04.888000+00:00) : so you can see gabe newell in person
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:02:59.775000+00:00) : it would be coolest to go on monday
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:02:25.122000+00:00) : it's 200 instead of 100 but more people are only available for the weekend
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:02:10.897000+00:00) : if no one buys the finals ticket thats fine because it's way more in demand anyway
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:01:38.768000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:01:12.849000+00:00) : well ronald would only be there on the weekend
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:00:40.968000+00:00) : he got cursed
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:00:38.465000+00:00) : we all know what happened to keenan
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T06:00:19.471000+00:00) : i would appreciate it though if someone i knew bought my tickets so i dont have to deal with strangers
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:59:56.595000+00:00) : yes
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:59:47.330000+00:00) : thats fine too
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:59:26.228000+00:00) : you would have to buy it from me
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:59:18.150000+00:00) : you cant
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:59:04.248000+00:00) : the midweek is only 100 for mon-thurs
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:58:50.725000+00:00) : keenan would you want the midweek ticket and ronald can take the finals ticket
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:53:25.663000+00:00) : for the whole week or just the weekend
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:51:57.891000+00:00) : ripe old age of 2
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:51:04.067000+00:00) : to see ronald
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:50:58.688000+00:00) : no i think he meant he's going to california
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:50:17.318000+00:00) : so we would probably leave on sunday
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:50:12.768000+00:00) : although grand finals is on sat
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:48:47.681000+00:00) : that would be neat
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:47:09.555000+00:00) : no do you want a weekend ticket
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:46:52.755000+00:00) : aug 7-12

71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:43:09.280000+00:00) : yeah i would have to sit at a desk but it's no different then what i'd have to do to if i was streaming from my computer
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:41:45.017000+00:00) : it actually doesnt look bad at all if the lighting is right
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:41:23.422000+00:00) : i would just need a phone stand
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:41:19.823000+00:00) : no i was literally wanting to do it with my phone via periscope
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:39:07.825000+00:00) : periscope
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:38:40.707000+00:00) : i want to figure out how to stream my 3ds
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:37:44.905000+00:00) : but there are tons of bugs
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:37:37.314000+00:00) : like it's technically supported
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:37:21.268000+00:00) : i heard the elgato streaming software doesnt work on macs
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:36:26.441000+00:00) : remember when you used to stream
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T05:36:06.392000+00:00) : i feel like i havent talked to you in forever

71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T04:10:59.657000+00:00) : hes on a team with blitz and bulba and they are playing against moonmeander and dubu and a random invoker player who just keep feeding down mid
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T04:07:35.349000+00:00) : these na pubs are so cancerous
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T04:07:24.734000+00:00) : and literally everyone on the enemy team is just feeding him
71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T04:07:11.260000+00:00) : ok he started a new game to get 10k

71716577669550080 (2017-06-26T03:18:08.626000+00:00) : asher come watch history being made
71716577669550080 (2017-06-25T23:16:08.174000+00:00) : it like they are "there" but don't actually help me fight
71716577669550080 (2017-06-25T23:15:41.333000+00:00) : but it's weird when i unlock major characters in certain story cutscenes and i cant even use them because i like my older, more seasoned guys more
71716577669550080 (2017-06-25T23:14:21.652000+00:00) : yeah i guess it adds a lot of replayability
71716577669550080 (2017-06-25T23:12:58.687000+00:00) : why
71716577669550080 (2017-06-25T23:10:36.098000+00:00) : It really makes me sad because I would have to grind a lot to unlock all the possible support conversations
71716577669550080 (2017-06-25T23:10:03.464000+00:00) : In shadows of valentia you can use your whole army at all times
71716577669550080 (2017-06-25T23:09:43.702000+00:00) : Ugh the main problem with awakening is they give you so many characters you want to use but you can only pick about half per battle
71716577669550080 (2017-06-25T22:59:50.841000+00:00) : Should I marry my 1000 year old dragon to a child
71716577669550080 (2017-06-25T22:52:43.685000+00:00) : This is bullshit chrom can't marry who I want him to
71716577669550080 (2017-06-25T22:23:13.928000+00:00) : I also have a billion single player games to beat
71716577669550080 (2017-06-25T22:21:45.987000+00:00) : The games I played last night sucked
71716577669550080 (2017-06-25T22:20:47.680000+00:00) : Maybe I kind of don't like playing dota atm
71716577669550080 (2017-06-25T22:19:34.514000+00:00) : Play some video games

71716577669550080 (2017-06-20T15:12:26.345000+00:00) : it's more like you created a really challenging puzzle that took people 3 years to solve
71716577669550080 (2017-06-20T05:41:41.102000+00:00) : i wish i could create a game that has hundreds of thousands people playing but it it takes 3 years before the first person beats it

71716577669550080 (2017-06-20T05:38:54.686000+00:00) : and i think it's funny that all the highest rated ones werent originally mobile games

71716577669550080 (2017-06-13T15:13:21.012000+00:00) : i think we should live near each other and maybe even share resources at the start just to get situated in the whole mod situation

71716577669550080 (2017-06-13T14:53:49.578000+00:00) : i know but how are you on discord then
71716577669550080 (2017-06-13T14:51:12.101000+00:00) : buty you're on your laptop right?
71716577669550080 (2017-06-13T14:50:51.565000+00:00) : i am still downloading on my one
71716577669550080 (2017-06-13T14:50:39.243000+00:00) : you can try logging on if you have the client ready
71716577669550080 (2017-06-13T14:50:27.824000+00:00) : anyway ftb is lookin more promising since i fixed the port problem
71716577669550080 (2017-06-13T14:49:01.306000+00:00) : basically i was a sheep
71716577669550080 (2017-06-13T14:46:15.390000+00:00) : because the last time i was trying it there was an error
71716577669550080 (2017-06-13T14:46:08.436000+00:00) : but the real test now is if ftb will work on server
71716577669550080 (2017-06-13T14:45:29.498000+00:00) : but i only used certain steps from the tutorial since there were parts i had already done
71716577669550080 (2017-06-13T14:45:10.677000+00:00) : if i just did it on my own intuition it wouldnt have messed up
71716577669550080 (2017-06-13T14:44:55.913000+00:00) : the google tutorial ended up screwing me
71716577669550080 (2017-06-13T14:44:36.398000+00:00) : im installing ftb on my personal client now to test
71716577669550080 (2017-06-13T14:44:05.094000+00:00) : wel maybe only two very's

71716577669550080 (2017-06-13T14:09:45.066000+00:00) : but it's just the universe i think most people are interested in
71716577669550080 (2017-06-13T14:09:33.223000+00:00) : and looks completely different gameplay wise
71716577669550080 (2017-06-13T14:09:24.740000+00:00) : the new game is a prequel apparently

71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T20:12:47.298000+00:00) : i actuaaly had a dream that fire emblem switch could be played enitrely with the touch screen so you dont even have to attach the joycons
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T20:10:38.449000+00:00) : jesus

71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T20:04:06.177000+00:00) : classes probably get a little more complex than that
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T20:03:59.352000+00:00) : haha
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T20:01:32.629000+00:00) : so basically dota but with my favorite final fantasy character final fantasy
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:55:58.337000+00:00) : im impressed but im tired of hearing about it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:55:52.431000+00:00) : it genuinely seems like they did a good job, 60fps full resolution in each mode and all the features of the other versions of the other games except the campaign
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:53:57.528000+00:00) : good on ea for making a good port but i literally dont give a shit
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:53:35.843000+00:00) : literally half the posts on the switch subreddit are about how good the port of fifa 18 is and it's super annoying
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:47:08.378000+00:00) : and it's going to get so much better
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:47:00.789000+00:00) : nick already has three tweets about the shirts
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:46:41.677000+00:00) : best of luck to them
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:45:33.496000+00:00) : i think if they try again in ayear it will be much more successful
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:45:17.665000+00:00) : they were too ambitious going into a campaign like that without any gameplay
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:45:06.452000+00:00) : it's still not going to get funded
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:44:33.897000+00:00) : yup
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:44:09.359000+00:00) : but it's still not real gameplay
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:44:05.003000+00:00) : yeah i think they realized no one is oging to back their kickstarter if they have zero gameplay
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:43:27.996000+00:00) : i cant wait for nick robinson's tweets during

71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:38:58.675000+00:00) : but keenan did you just witness the most powerful console ever?
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:38:20.683000+00:00) : look at all their shirts
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:38:17.684000+00:00) : lol this image is so funny https://twitter.com/albertpenello/status/873986403071406080
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:36:40.471000+00:00) : so i'll have to work on that
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:36:37.208000+00:00) : though it might also be because it's third party
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:35:43.781000+00:00) : now i can firmly hold each controller in my hand and say with confidence that the xbox one's is the the worst
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:34:40.871000+00:00) : pretty much everything that people thought was negative
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:34:31.578000+00:00) : yeah they are fixing everything about it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:34:16.793000+00:00) : i just got the ps4 controller because it was on sale and it's sexy as fuck
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:33:13.148000+00:00) : i want to play a 3 player game on my pc and hand everyone a controller from a different console
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:32:40.327000+00:00) : no ive had the xbox one for a while
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:32:11.380000+00:00) : the gang is all here
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:32:02.614000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:30:53.992000+00:00) : art
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:28:37.213000+00:00) : or general handyness
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:28:32.912000+00:00) : science olympiad type stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:28:28.671000+00:00) : we can have a category for building stuff/crafting/project things
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:27:42.517000+00:00) : yeah we pretty much have all of life covered here
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:26:14.606000+00:00) : ronald you are ahead of me because you have probably at least seen a cigarette in real life before
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:25:42.308000+00:00) : "nicest" is not something we spend time doing
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:23:43.347000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:23:40.549000+00:00) : yeah you should go on jeopardy
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:22:22.060000+00:00) : i dont mean to be offensive but i do think you pick up a lot of random things from classes
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:21:47.864000+00:00) : just because i think being in school helps with that
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:21:37.664000+00:00) : i went ahead and put you ahead on trivia
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:16:57.921000+00:00) : is that a side effect of the porn differential
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:16:15.046000+00:00) : enjoyment doesnt really factor into it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:16:01.548000+00:00) : or time spent doing
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:15:55.437000+00:00) : since this is more of a level of experience thing
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:15:39.448000+00:00) : in that case then ronald would be ahead
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:14:07.831000+00:00) : but i thought ronald doesnt do it since he cant ever get high
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:13:43.788000+00:00) : asher
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:13:05.219000+00:00) : keenan i dont know im really trying to stop
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:12:02.585000+00:00) : yeah decycles definitely counts towards travel
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:11:06.967000+00:00) : but just inside the u.s.
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:10:58.117000+00:00) : you have to realize ive been able to fly for free my whole life
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:10:49.559000+00:00) : and every summer i go to at least two other places besides AZ
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:10:36.738000+00:00) : before college and highschool i traveled all the time
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:09:07.436000+00:00) : AZ is just the most frequent
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:08:53.244000+00:00) : ive been to almost every state
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:07:52.899000+00:00) : he's probably been to more unique places
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:07:48.006000+00:00) : yeah i think keenan coudl win in travel
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:07:22.960000+00:00) : obviouslly i only really know the last like 5-6 years
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:07:06.203000+00:00) : as far as i know
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:07:00.950000+00:00) : i was considering lifetime
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:06:19.225000+00:00) : the rest is really hard to rank
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:06:07.803000+00:00) : the only definite thing about travel is that asher is last
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:04:40.319000+00:00) : you should have a cooking war
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:04:34.760000+00:00) : i just you know you both cook more than me and asher
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:04:06.472000+00:00) : ronald
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:03:44.303000+00:00) : idk couldnt decide
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:01:06.254000+00:00) : ronald all of those are the same place
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:00:23.698000+00:00) : and it's pretty consistent every year
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T19:00:13.123000+00:00) : i go on a ton of small trips throughout the year
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:59:53.989000+00:00) : it was ahrd to determine between me and you
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:59:43.873000+00:00) : yeah you're definitely more than ronald
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:56:53.888000+00:00) : i think i meant to put that
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:56:48.814000+00:00) : yeah you might be above asher
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:55:26.833000+00:00) : so pop culture
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:55:04.673000+00:00) : i think it depends too much what the trivia is about
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:53:06.634000+00:00) : im just good or bad at everything
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:52:58.733000+00:00) : ronald is very well rounded
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:52:53.759000+00:00) : yeah see
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:50:05.802000+00:00) : i will put in formulas to count
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:49:21.878000+00:00) : im either first or last in everything
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:48:58.532000+00:00) : thanks for making me google cunnilingus
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:48:26.661000+00:00) : yeah anytime i could be listening to a podcast it's probably music instead
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:48:15.898000+00:00) : ah ok
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:47:42.791000+00:00) : i do listen to probably more podcasts than ronald and maybe asher
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:47:22.740000+00:00) : you could list podcasts though
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:47:04.627000+00:00) : yeah its not very interesting to rank websites i think
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:46:28.783000+00:00) : like i know me and ronald use reddit the most and you and asher use tumblr the most
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:46:12.278000+00:00) : but thats too hard to determine
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:46:02.764000+00:00) : i thought about listing all the internet websites too
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:45:51.804000+00:00) : is accurate
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:43:50.617000+00:00) : i dont play chess but i play the japanese anime version
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:42:51.206000+00:00) : lol ronald higher than asher in pokemon even though he owns two of the games
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:41:51.324000+00:00) : thats what i considered as reading
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:41:42.516000+00:00) : i put books
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:40:49.201000+00:00) : because i dont count biking as working out
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:40:31.323000+00:00) : i only knew ronald does it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:40:26.398000+00:00) : i just didnt know about you guys
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:40:22.131000+00:00) : we can rank exercising too

71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:31:15.757000+00:00) : warning: it's pretty stupid
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:30:58.921000+00:00) : except this time at 5 am
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:30:54.639000+00:00) : i made another thing last night
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:30:44.317000+00:00) : that reminds me
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:29:02.112000+00:00) : idk
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:23:31.322000+00:00) : i am really tempted to buy this
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:21:01.220000+00:00) : the creep shots of miyamoto and the wild speculation based of nintendo employee's shirts
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:20:49.217000+00:00) : this is my favorite part
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:20:30.908000+00:00) : lol it begins https://twitter.com/SteveMBowling/status/873965415373848576
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:18:37.822000+00:00) : there's an oval spot on the far right of the right button that already looks like toad's hat
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:17:02.852000+00:00) : i know nick also loves these high res mario shots
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:16:31.113000+00:00) : then tweet it at nick and patrick and they will retweet
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:16:21.806000+00:00) : make an album with a series of images zooming in on the button until at the end the good toad is revealed
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:15:01.391000+00:00) : hl3
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:14:14.878000+00:00) : the bottome definitely is
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:12:36.898000+00:00) : and seams forming his glove
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:12:13.631000+00:00) : he even has seams where his pants zippers would be
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:12:04.534000+00:00) : this is way too detailed
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:11:25.052000+00:00) : i also just realized mario has no neck
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:10:31.342000+00:00) : i think this is a high res render of the actual model so if you were to stand real close to the camera in game you could maybe see his hair
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:09:06.366000+00:00) : open this in browser and zoom in
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:08:56.490000+00:00) : just a reminder: http://cdn4.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/NintendoSwitch_SuperMarioOdyssey_character_01_png_jpgcopy.jpg
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:06:08.935000+00:00) : i can see it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:05:23.286000+00:00) : they are genius to tap into that market when no VC exists for a while
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:05:08.735000+00:00) : yeah that company publishing all these neo geo games on the switch is the real mvp
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:05:04.234000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:04:28.156000+00:00) : oh nice it's co-op
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T18:03:53.683000+00:00) : did you get on the switch?
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T17:59:45.019000+00:00) : that sounds like a pacman game
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T17:59:19.645000+00:00) : also most of the actual gameplay and stuff will happen throughout the day on tuesday and wednesday
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T17:58:52.511000+00:00) : you can at least play it at work
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T17:57:58.552000+00:00) : i like the ui as you scroll
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T17:57:51.425000+00:00) : nintendo has a sexy e3 website https://e3.nintendo.com/
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T17:56:10.607000+00:00) : 9 am PT

71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T17:49:41.004000+00:00) : but anyway thats too late to hang sorry
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T17:49:26.341000+00:00) : yeah different websites were sawying different things but im going to trust the most recent
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T17:07:56.802000+00:00) : I guess Bethesda is midnight now
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T17:07:48.592000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:49:55.273000+00:00) : In Japan
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:49:43.822000+00:00) : I can imagine every Japanese game developer attending the launch parties of every other major game
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:49:20.227000+00:00) : They probably attend the same parties
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:49:01.949000+00:00) : Lol I bet he hangs with kojima more than the solid snake guy
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:48:39.220000+00:00) : The interviewers are just Nintendo employees so they are like old buddies
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:47:37.160000+00:00) : Also if he has the translator covers it up
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:47:20.810000+00:00) : No he hasn't lost it yet
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:44:30.647000+00:00) : That guy literally always wears a Mario shirt
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:43:01.803000+00:00) : https://www.instagram.com/p/BVNHTbfBISI/
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:40:56.397000+00:00) : Yeah that would probably be at sony
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:39:16.895000+00:00) : Ah ok
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:38:49.772000+00:00) : At least EA's was
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:38:40.513000+00:00) : It's more like a cringe fest
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:37:03.825000+00:00) : I am
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:36:36.236000+00:00) : But if I do then yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:36:26.609000+00:00) : I have an assignment due at midnight i need to get that done
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:36:12.016000+00:00) : Perhaps
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:35:16.780000+00:00) : Why wouldn't he also want to watch Bethesda
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:34:36.324000+00:00) : Twin peaks only takes like 40 min right
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:34:23.113000+00:00) : That's perfect
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:33:50.921000+00:00) : 1am - Devolver Digital
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:33:10.776000+00:00) : 5 - Microsoft
8 - Reggie appears on Geoff Keighley's show
10 - Bethesda
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:30:01.308000+00:00) : You gotta watch them so you understand the memes
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:29:45.568000+00:00) : I will also call for the ones today if you are around
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:28:05.231000+00:00) : Good we should call
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:27:01.319000+00:00) : Are you working on Tuesday
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:24:33.899000+00:00) : But still all the stages and music from all the Nintendo games
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:24:20.609000+00:00) : So it's just them
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:24:05.123000+00:00) : But ice climbers are the only characters the switch can handle
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:23:44.731000+00:00) : What I'd they made smash
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:23:11.295000+00:00) : People also think pikmin 4 is very likely but I'm in doubt because of pikmin 3ds
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:22:34.320000+00:00) : Anything he does is brilliant
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:21:30.028000+00:00) : Only one of those is going to happen at e3
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:21:20.074000+00:00) : There's only 3 games I'm extremely hyped for Odyssey, Fire emblem 2018, and animal crossing switch
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:20:39.240000+00:00) : I think decent for mobile title
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:19:41.817000+00:00) : Yes
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:18:23.250000+00:00) : But not sure that they would announce it at e3 because Nintendo is slowly moving away from big e3 announcements
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:17:42.639000+00:00) : I also think it's about time for a new dk
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:16:03.472000+00:00) : It just didn't seem like 2017 game to me
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:14:25.370000+00:00) : I think it might be slotted for that but we literally haven't heard anything about it since January
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:14:07.797000+00:00) : Because I don't even know if that's supposed to come out in 2017
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:11:24.794000+00:00) : The only real unlikely things are smt, octopath, and retro studios
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:09:07.620000+00:00) : It probably couldn't even be done by one person who doesn't work at Nintendo
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:08:50.187000+00:00) : That would take a lot of work
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:08:38.253000+00:00) : True mother 3 has a lot of text
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:06:53.660000+00:00) : It's almost time for a new one
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:06:45.137000+00:00) : It's been like 2-3 years since they localized mother 1
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:06:23.250000+00:00) : Mother 3 isnt bonkers
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:05:31.241000+00:00) : That would be funny
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T16:03:27.984000+00:00) : These were very well thought out by me at 3 am so I hope you like
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T15:56:35.704000+00:00) : This is so you all can see how right I was in a couple days
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T15:56:21.798000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T15:56:05.093000+00:00) : E3 2017 PREDICTIONS

General: Nintendo seems more focused on marketing their existing games this year rather than announcing new ones. For that reason I expect little surprises but if we get a ton of Mario info and I can get some taste of the new Xenoblade soundtrack I will be a very happy boy.

71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T04:27:26.233000+00:00) : ive been listening to the song from this cutscene forever and i only just now realized it was from fire emblem https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBFWOEdxd_c
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T01:39:14.652000+00:00) : The only thing that sucks is that I can't unlock the support conversations for everyone unless I do a ton of grinding
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T01:37:22.204000+00:00) : This is like stardew valley but I can matchmake with everyone
71716577669550080 (2017-06-11T01:37:02.397000+00:00) : I also found the perfect wife for my boy Frederick who my favorite way too dedicated knight

71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T19:48:05.356000+00:00) : including offline singlyplayer campaign
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T19:47:55.715000+00:00) : 30 minutes of star wars
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T19:34:28.392000+00:00) : you can only play in split screen
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T19:34:13.496000+00:00) : that's really interesting to see in this era of games
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T19:33:59.612000+00:00) : wow they just announced a co-op only story-based game by the guy who made brothers a tale of two sons
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T19:27:27.668000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T19:24:04.975000+00:00) : things get really akward when they start struggling to read off the teleprompter
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T19:21:04.940000+00:00) : the best part of this is seeing nick robinson's tweets come in live making fun of everything
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T19:14:07.562000+00:00) : except the difference is that their esports are actually just real sports but digital
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T19:13:54.444000+00:00) : ea is emphasizing esports too
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T19:08:50.308000+00:00) : everyone is just reading terribly scripted statements
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T19:02:52.601000+00:00) : oh look another sports game with terrible facial animations

71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:12:39.838000+00:00) : that reminds me
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:10:29.707000+00:00) : color splash looked so good
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:10:16.204000+00:00) : jesus
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:10:15.142000+00:00) : with a fully orchestrated soundtrack
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:10:08.508000+00:00) : thousand year door in the same graphical style as color splash
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:09:59.471000+00:00) : can you imagine
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:09:56.885000+00:00) : but god
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:08:56.004000+00:00) : they have to stop making all these new IPs when they could just remaster metroid and people would love them forever
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:08:14.804000+00:00) : and especially gamecube ones that arent on VC
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:08:02.713000+00:00) : there are so many games from the n64 gamecube era that i never played
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:07:48.713000+00:00) : i would love that
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:06:49.687000+00:00) : it seems plausible though dont you think
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:05:18.888000+00:00) : also it's called DX
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:05:08.728000+00:00) : this promo image has new characters
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:05:02.459000+00:00) : http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/04/rumour_mario_and_luigi_superstar_saga_dx_partnering_up_for_3ds_eshop
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:04:26.605000+00:00) : I dont know why everyone forgot about this
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:04:13.058000+00:00) : https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/1/15500040/mario-and-luigi-superstar-saga-dx-nintendo-3ds
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:03:45.735000+00:00) : mother 3 is just a hunch because it seems about time
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:03:26.405000+00:00) : it had art assets and everything
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:03:15.750000+00:00) : but i remember a couple months ago there was a really convincing leak about a superstar saga remake for 3ds
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:02:56.005000+00:00) : yeah no one has been talking about it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:02:41.806000+00:00) : and also a remake of superstar saga
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:02:30.269000+00:00) : so also keenan i think it's really likely mother 3 localization will be announced at e3
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:01:06.265000+00:00) : to cash in on the serious game news podcast business every other journal has been doing for years
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T05:00:38.900000+00:00) : did you see that polygon just today started a serious podcast
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:59:50.602000+00:00) : they parody general gaming stuff too
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:59:37.441000+00:00) : there needs to be more stuff like this in the gaming industry
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:58:44.383000+00:00) : https://twitter.com/PorygonNews
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:57:08.668000+00:00) : or that no one really wants to play anyway
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:56:57.759000+00:00) : but these are the games that frequently go on sale on psn or steam
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:56:35.720000+00:00) : or only have an xbox one as their only console
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:56:25.647000+00:00) : yeah it's really great for people who dont have access to a pc
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:56:17.410000+00:00) : and the rest are games that i dont want to own
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:55:50.337000+00:00) : hell i already own half of these
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:55:01.035000+00:00) : the only bad thing about the xbox game pass is that most of the games with the exception of halo are things that you can get really cheap on steam or humble
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:53:26.747000+00:00) : it's basically what nintendo is going to be doing with it's online
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:53:09.441000+00:00) : as long as you are still paying your subscription
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:53:02.853000+00:00) : so there's no difference from actually owning them
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:52:52.130000+00:00) : well the main reason it's superior is that the games are downloaded instead of streamed
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:52:14.197000+00:00) : that doesnt make any sense to me
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:51:46.840000+00:00) : i mean cant you just buy those in psn normally
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:51:30.401000+00:00) : yeah but you're already paying 10 dollars a month for all these games, there's no reason to buy them by itself
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:51:03.214000+00:00) : thats the whole point of the game pass
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:50:58.568000+00:00) : but you dont have to
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:50:11.718000+00:00) : what do you mean
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:49:26.572000+00:00) : plus i think you dont even need an xbox to use it (?) just a pc
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:49:07.176000+00:00) : because it's really cheap and unlike anything else offered at the moment
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:48:46.483000+00:00) : i think their netflix style service could be really good
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:48:38.031000+00:00) : but you do have a point
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:48:08.995000+00:00) : https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/xbox-unleashed-our-deep-dive-study-of-how-millions-use-xbox-live/
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:47:08.874000+00:00) : but in practice they dont use it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:47:02.110000+00:00) : consumers always say they want backwards compatibility
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:46:41.383000+00:00) : they went very in depth on their process and how they got all the data
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:46:32.078000+00:00) : read it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:46:19.446000+00:00) : it is very true
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:46:09.785000+00:00) : that study i linked revealed like 2% of xbox live users play 360 games on their xbox one
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:45:48.506000+00:00) : no one uses xbox backwards compatibility
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:44:25.400000+00:00) : but there's like a 0% chance they will open it up like that
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:44:08.065000+00:00) : but theoretically a 500-600 dollar 4k capable console that can play any pc game as well would sell really well
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:43:37.930000+00:00) : but then at that point you sacrifice any software optimizations microsoft could make
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:43:17.586000+00:00) : they best thing they could do is allow steam or something on it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:43:09.262000+00:00) : it will only sell if it has games
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:43:03.785000+00:00) : i dont think any of this matters though
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:42:56.387000+00:00) : but this thing still has way better specs
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:42:36.485000+00:00) : but just with more games and with more at native 4k
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:42:24.147000+00:00) : i think the scorpio could manage at least that
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:42:09.824000+00:00) : the ps4 pro has very few games that can actually get true 4k at 30fps
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:41:53.651000+00:00) : no i still think it could hit 30 fps in 4k
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:41:38.040000+00:00) : sshh
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:41:18.583000+00:00) : in 60fps
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:41:14.844000+00:00) : but it might run their highly optimized first party ones at 4k
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:41:04.326000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:41:00.166000+00:00) : unless it can run every pc game, it's useless in my mind
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:40:49.164000+00:00) : still
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:40:43.022000+00:00) : the reason they can price something that can run forza at 60fps 4k so low is because they are probaly selling at a loss and have done a ton of software hardware optimizations
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:40:00.382000+00:00) : or even if it costs 600
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:39:43.468000+00:00) : because if it costs 500, you definitely cant build a 4k gaming pc for 500
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:39:16.566000+00:00) : yeah i think it will  be the cheapest way to enthusiast graphics
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:37:49.981000+00:00) : i actually think microsoft can optimize their hardware and software in a way that makes the scorpio cheaper than an equivalently speced gaming pc
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:37:25.819000+00:00) : i think the scorpio has some market for people who want to play games in 4k but dont want to build a pc
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:34:51.837000+00:00) : sounds fun.
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:32:34.337000+00:00) : especially if your name is microsoft
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:32:20.889000+00:00) : how do you even have a conference that long
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:32:14.438000+00:00) : microsoft's is fucking 90 minutes
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:32:09.152000+00:00) : i hope ea's isnt more than an hour
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:29:44.676000+00:00) : i mainly just want to see this star wards game
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:29:34.505000+00:00) : yea i want someone to talk to otherwise i will get bored
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:29:02.033000+00:00) : yeah it's at 3

71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:15:42.630000+00:00) : These games are WANTED dead or...actually just alive. It's hard to enjoy broken games.
71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:14:02.390000+00:00) : except for that one guy who actually wrote a helpful review

71716577669550080 (2017-06-10T04:11:57.725000+00:00) : Worst game place ever! I think u all r some over priced a. Holes. N ripping people off. Smh. Given people not even $5 for a game then trying to sell it for 34.99 fyi people u can get most of the games they r selling for under $10 online. 😉 I laughed at the guys in bedford. Glad u all r ok to rip people off that bad.

71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T19:09:11.091000+00:00) : my brother has also spent the last several days watching archives of critical role
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T19:05:47.939000+00:00) : but idk

71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:58:11.522000+00:00) : ok
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:57:19.507000+00:00) : i could see it gettinga  remake but i think its the type of game to be updated forever instead of getting a sequel
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:54:37.673000+00:00) : but it could take a while to port since it's an unreal 3 game and switch only supports unreal 4 officially
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:54:20.625000+00:00) : people want that game on switch so much
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:54:12.620000+00:00) : probably

71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:51:59.131000+00:00) : what do you mean
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:51:11.802000+00:00) : yup thats what you do with one fof the worst video games of all time
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:50:50.369000+00:00) : lol "Shaq Fu was met with mixed responses from critics upon release, though it has since come to be considered one of the worst video games of all time. A sequel, Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn, is in development."
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:49:45.145000+00:00) : but keenan it sucked really bad

71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:42:34.756000+00:00) : i wonder how they made them that fast

71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:36:47.059000+00:00) : they are just all original intellictual property created by the team at nba
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:36:38.275000+00:00) : they have no association whatsoever to real people
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:36:01.781000+00:00) : they all have different lore and personalities
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:35:52.826000+00:00) : you basically treat them like pokemon
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:35:41.620000+00:00) : they are each a unique new character
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:35:32.809000+00:00) : i think you just have to treat it like any other game where you collect characters
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:34:35.095000+00:00) : like what's happening with yookalaylee
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:34:25.516000+00:00) : i heard that the update thats coming out for all systems basically fixes everything negative about the game
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:33:41.918000+00:00) : i want to play it with you next time i see you
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:33:26.366000+00:00) : ia it good
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:32:13.692000+00:00) : do they even have any multiplayer games
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:31:28.119000+00:00) : it would be blizzard
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:31:17.558000+00:00) : sony doesnt have any esports
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:30:45.241000+00:00) : there's a clear season and off-season
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:30:05.352000+00:00) : the problem with real sports is they only have one big tournament a year
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:29:01.363000+00:00) : so if the invitationals get enough viewership we could see more
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:28:40.215000+00:00) : and they arent going to sponsor teams or players unless ther are tournaments with lots of viewership
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:28:22.081000+00:00) : but its not going to be really big until we start seeing real esport organizations start sponsoring teams for these games
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:27:52.962000+00:00) : yeah they are slowly getting into with their three invitationals at e3
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:27:18.357000+00:00) : thast basically what blizzard did to make overwatch an esport overnight
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:27:07.803000+00:00) : all they need to do is host tournaments with large prize pools or pay third party tournament organizers to do that
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:26:19.851000+00:00) : but with new donk city
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:26:07.056000+00:00) : it wouldve been like an amusement park
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T18:25:57.141000+00:00) : we shouldve gone to e3

71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T17:51:18.621000+00:00) : they have so much ip sitting there that could be made into esports if they just let it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T17:50:12.759000+00:00) : Nintendo could easily become as big as Valve or Blizzard in the esports scene if they started officially sponsoring melee tournaments and tournaments for their other games
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T17:46:02.013000+00:00) : *We don't give a shit about melee

71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T17:38:38.411000+00:00) : mr shifty is good

71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T17:32:13.241000+00:00) : i havent gotten shantae yet but only because i have too much else to play right now
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T17:31:58.446000+00:00) : you should
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T17:25:51.777000+00:00) : so good on them
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T17:25:43.220000+00:00) : yeah basically it was a decent release but they promised online multiplayer within a few days and instead it took weeks
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T17:22:57.692000+00:00) : "We are still working with our partners to determine exactly how NBA Playgrounds players will receive their free copy of Shaq Fu when it releases this Fall, but if you bought or buy in to NBA Playgrounds before the patch hits, you’re getting a free copy of Shaq Fu. Why? Like we said at the beginning, we love our players and we’re always going to work to do right by them."

71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T17:20:04.083000+00:00) : yeah i think the update comes out next week
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T17:18:29.197000+00:00) : you get a free copy of the new one if you buy nba playgrounds before the update that fixes everything
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T17:16:54.770000+00:00) : best marketing slogan ever
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T17:16:47.760000+00:00) : BETTER. THAN. THE OLD ONE.
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T16:57:53.399000+00:00) : are you going to play with us
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T16:57:49.694000+00:00) : its hard if you dont have a four stack all collaborating
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T04:10:31.050000+00:00) : i think troll would be really good against the wolf boss
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T04:08:54.174000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T04:07:25.171000+00:00) : 😢
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T04:07:22.745000+00:00) : "I wouldn't suggest Lina."
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T02:16:01.053000+00:00) : also <@!127535721857679362> you should find a way to play this dota 2 campaign with us
71716577669550080 (2017-06-09T02:15:37.505000+00:00) : <@!125452744440938497> AAAASSHEEEER
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T21:40:13.782000+00:00) : Don't worry I have other games to play
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T21:38:12.721000+00:00) : DIABLO
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T20:59:13.055000+00:00) : You know what this means

71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T04:11:09.385000+00:00) : it's pretty long but they timestamp everything and i think you really like it
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T04:10:03.333000+00:00) : keenan you should really listen to the 8-4 podcast http://8-4.jp/blog/
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:51:03.631000+00:00) : because it's one of the only games miyamoto has confirmed he's working on
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:50:05.072000+00:00) : i always forget
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:50:02.730000+00:00) : dude pikmin 4 has a real chance of being announced
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:48:06.499000+00:00) : that would certainly be easier to implement
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:37:27.803000+00:00) : yeah i could probably use command blocks
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:32:37.101000+00:00) : yeah you would probably need to tweak the settings of a combination of existing mods
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:31:31.728000+00:00) : because it seems to specific to exist already
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:31:10.448000+00:00) : ^ this sounds like a mod that i would have to make myself
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:30:30.577000+00:00) : what if we did it so we made a premade seed and blocked off areas
and then made it so the only way to get into the next grid was to pay a crazy amount of resources
so it kept land we havent touched yet in good condition but also gives incentive to rape the current land
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:29:14.484000+00:00) : it would have been cool to see some sort of story mode with all the interesting characters
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:28:59.055000+00:00) : at least arms nails the gameplay
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:28:40.989000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:27:06.030000+00:00) : also doesnt it have a really shitty dlc model
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:26:16.843000+00:00) : i dont really understand why its not a game that interests you though
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:25:58.995000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:24:06.128000+00:00) : which is crazy that the arms reviewer for polygon compared arm's grand prix to injustice
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:23:47.294000+00:00) : not a high bar
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:23:44.926000+00:00) : i was just going to say
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:22:12.387000+00:00) : some of the dialogue in this video i wasnt sure was real or want edited in by dunkey somehow
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:20:31.246000+00:00) : except you never do
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:20:09.539000+00:00) : anyway https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSYWIh7ajR4
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:19:46.659000+00:00) : you never know there could have been some obscure snes guitar hero
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:19:20.412000+00:00) : because otherwise it would have just been mediocre
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:19:12.886000+00:00) : i just needed to be sure that it was a well crafted joke
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:18:49.749000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:18:49.011000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:17:34.017000+00:00) : its not like his normal game rant
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:17:18.514000+00:00) : lol the tone of his voice is very telling

71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:13:30.994000+00:00) : the campaign does not look good
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:12:41.270000+00:00) : the reviewer just compared it to injustice 2 which he gave a 9
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:12:30.559000+00:00) : i read the polygon review

71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:09:35.255000+00:00) : keenan i believe it's referred to as "art"
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:09:11.769000+00:00) : almost enough for a whole team
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:09:08.006000+00:00) : which has 3 members btw
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:09:03.979000+00:00) : for the official DotA 2 team "Unborn Meta"

71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:07:51.590000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:00:21.653000+00:00) : And more vibrancy
71716577669550080 (2017-06-08T00:00:09.742000+00:00) : The colors actually repesent their names
71716577669550080 (2017-06-07T22:28:22.644000+00:00) : Finally Minecraft gets some blocks with a real color palette https://youtu.be/k2dQuIIUT-o

71716577669550080 (2017-06-07T19:26:23.213000+00:00) : how old are the games that they are remakes of
71716577669550080 (2017-06-07T19:18:43.895000+00:00) : man Atlus is releasing a bunch of 3ds rpgs in rapid succession

71716577669550080 (2017-06-07T18:54:10.822000+00:00) : it has to be a lot
71716577669550080 (2017-06-07T18:45:36.132000+00:00) : you cant blame them when they have data like this
71716577669550080 (2017-06-07T18:45:22.391000+00:00) : lol and i remember all the shit microsoft got when they announce the xbox one without backwards compatibility initially
71716577669550080 (2017-06-07T18:44:56.178000+00:00) : "The second-most surprising high-level result from our Xbox usage sample is just how unpopular Xbox 360 backward compatibility is in actual practice (Fig. 1). Playing games from the previous console accounts for under two percent of total Xbox One usage in our sample. For context, that means the hundreds of backward compatible Xbox 360 games combine to represent less than half of the play time that a game like Grand Theft Auto V manages on its own."
71716577669550080 (2017-06-07T18:42:38.648000+00:00) : high quality coding
71716577669550080 (2017-06-07T18:31:48.756000+00:00) : those fuckers were probably doing it wrong

71716577669550080 (2017-06-07T18:30:35.950000+00:00) : it's really cool reading about how Ars extracted and parsed all the data
71716577669550080 (2017-06-07T18:27:58.995000+00:00) : but that's not terribly surprising
71716577669550080 (2017-06-07T18:27:53.236000+00:00) : all the most owned steam games are valve games and civ 5

71716577669550080 (2017-06-07T18:24:44.540000+00:00) : or at least the games people are using it to play aren't very diverse
71716577669550080 (2017-06-07T18:24:29.398000+00:00) : this is not a very diverse library
71716577669550080 (2017-06-07T18:24:22.696000+00:00) : practically it doesnt
71716577669550080 (2017-06-07T18:22:07.587000+00:00) : that's crazy
71716577669550080 (2017-06-07T18:22:02.339000+00:00) : and the top 12 games (8 of which are shooters) make up 50% of all xbox one game playtime
71716577669550080 (2017-06-07T18:19:53.816000+00:00) : most of these games are third or first person shooters https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Xbox-Gauge-New-3.001new.jpg

71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T21:52:17.483000+00:00) : Shadows of valentia
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T18:32:30.426000+00:00) : the sov title screen track makes me extremely sentimental
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:37:44.336000+00:00) : they are all pretty cool
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:36:19.397000+00:00) : perhaps but they still design all the characters and stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:33:36.542000+00:00) : too muc FE
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:33:22.208000+00:00) : but now i know why there havent been any wario wares
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:33:10.730000+00:00) : and the first two metroids
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:32:47.457000+00:00) : paper mario, fire emblem, and warior ware
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:32:20.509000+00:00) : intelligent systems is amazing
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:32:12.272000+00:00) : god
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:31:07.603000+00:00) : no one judges her
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:25:28.667000+00:00) : it's why i also wish i knew japanese so i can see how much games change
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:24:11.571000+00:00) : because it needs to make sense in the specific culture
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:24:03.018000+00:00) : it involves a lot rewriting too
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:21:47.194000+00:00) : yeah and i think they can have more vulgar dialogue than normally noa would allow
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:19:03.521000+00:00) : cult game followings are weird
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:18:27.095000+00:00) : this is why so many people have played the original fire emblem gaiden before sov even though it only came out in japan
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:17:15.337000+00:00) : oh wtf its like 20 dollars
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:16:26.350000+00:00) : arent those expensive
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:14:26.725000+00:00) : it will be faster to wait until it's localized
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:13:28.321000+00:00) : thats going to take a while since you need to learn japanese first
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:12:18.793000+00:00) : i really want that game
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:11:59.623000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:09:48.526000+00:00) : i mean thats practically the only ip they have left
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:08:17.199000+00:00) : i dont see them announcing smash though because then no one will buy arms
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:06:18.039000+00:00) : takes a lot of really specific technology
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:06:07.169000+00:00) : the wii was the last nintendo console capable of handling the icies
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:05:50.901000+00:00) : oh right
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:04:51.506000+00:00) : if they actually do a port of smash 4 all they really need to add is ice climbers and a new singleplayer campaign
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:03:32.140000+00:00) : metroid at e3 confirmed
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:03:22.698000+00:00) : that practically only leaves metroid
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:03:17.252000+00:00) : zelda wont be there
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:03:14.472000+00:00) : pokemon wont be there
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:03:10.091000+00:00) : arms and splatoon wont really be at e3 except for their tournaments
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:01:27.146000+00:00) : so they cranked one out last weekend
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:01:17.966000+00:00) : it's halfway through the year and they almost forgot
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:00:40.124000+00:00) : "hey guys can we announce a new pokemon real quick"
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T17:00:24.868000+00:00) : gamefreak probably gave nintendo that much notice
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T16:59:49.279000+00:00) : even if it means just a week before
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T16:59:37.665000+00:00) : sticking to it i guess
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T16:59:29.411000+00:00) : it's crazy how they never announce pokemon games at e3
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T16:57:13.444000+00:00) : no more colors left
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T16:57:08.661000+00:00) : already used the 6 primary ones, red blue green yellow black white
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T16:56:45.070000+00:00) : yeah because they ran out of colors
71716577669550080 (2017-06-05T16:56:12.743000+00:00) : but pls no ranger

71716577669550080 (2017-05-31T23:57:07.618000+00:00) : Although they called him a perv so that was a little mean
71716577669550080 (2017-05-31T23:56:51.090000+00:00) : That video even had a <:armboy:307590740496875531> cameo
71716577669550080 (2017-05-31T23:56:19.853000+00:00) : But it's a really good toad.
71716577669550080 (2017-05-31T23:37:32.944000+00:00) : It reminds me of your satire project
71716577669550080 (2017-05-31T23:37:18.506000+00:00) : This show got serious real fast https://youtu.be/pMUKRxGPcRI

71716577669550080 (2017-05-30T21:55:48.756000+00:00) : We were talking about why there aren't more crossover games and I just remembered that a fire emblem/smt crossover exists
71716577669550080 (2017-05-30T17:14:46.681000+00:00) : it sounds like you need an io player
71716577669550080 (2017-05-30T17:14:38.619000+00:00) : damn
71716577669550080 (2017-05-30T17:14:31.220000+00:00) : in your favor?

71716577669550080 (2017-05-30T02:17:19.743000+00:00) : Good idea
71716577669550080 (2017-05-30T02:16:50.518000+00:00) : <@125452744440938497> <@127535721857679362> are we playing dota?
71716577669550080 (2017-05-29T22:42:00.875000+00:00) : It's insane how fire emblem makes you fight armies way higher level than you and you have to do it so that you don't lose a single unit
71716577669550080 (2017-05-29T22:40:58.722000+00:00) : I'm a tactical genius
71716577669550080 (2017-05-29T21:10:59.427000+00:00) : But not the first? I remember people thought the sequel was underwhelming when it came out​

71716577669550080 (2017-05-29T21:06:31.402000+00:00) : You're probably ignoring all the key mechanics
71716577669550080 (2017-05-29T17:24:34.383000+00:00) : <@155893986605793281> " In one of the prototypes seen earlier in development, one source recalled a hulky Donkey Kong themed rabbid serving as one of the first boss encounters. The rabbid has access to a pile of bananas that it can use to replenish its health. Players are required to first cut off his food supply to prevent him from recovering before they can do some real damage. The DK rabbid apparently will dab periodically if it lands an attack correctly (a possible reference to DK’s dab from Mario Kart 8). Once the boss is defeated, one member of the player’s party, a rabbid cosplaying as Princess Peach, takes out a smart phone and nabs a selfie with the DK Rabbid as it collapses."

71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T14:40:26.220000+00:00) : is a super hero in real life
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T14:33:08.495000+00:00) : esp since he already knows you
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T14:32:58.197000+00:00) : in which case it should be even easier
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T14:32:47.882000+00:00) : if it's not core for the major but the 400 class is there's no waqy this professor hasnt seen this before
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T14:32:24.368000+00:00) : but it could be essential for the 400 class
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T14:32:08.568000+00:00) : well it might not be core for the major
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T14:31:34.235000+00:00) : no becuase it might not work the 300 class might be a strict requirment
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T14:30:04.867000+00:00) : i think he would view it as heres this good student who wants to take my upper level class and i want him in my class again
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T14:29:14.769000+00:00) : just make the argument and since he knows you it will probably work
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T14:28:59.940000+00:00) : he prbably would
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T14:28:53.284000+00:00) : oh then thats probably easier
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T14:28:39.322000+00:00) : well the other professor could vouch for you getting out of the class
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T14:27:54.696000+00:00) : but you could ask for a note from him
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T14:27:46.791000+00:00) : thats dumb you should always talk to professors
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T14:25:06.484000+00:00) : i dont think thats avoidable unless you make a convincing argument or the professor already knows your good student/could do the material anyway
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T14:23:58.184000+00:00) : when i did it i went through each item of the syllabus of the class i didnt need to take and listed the other classes or experience i had that fulfilled it
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T14:23:17.083000+00:00) : like specifically what other classes you have that covered that matieral
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T14:22:59.940000+00:00) : you say that but also why you think you dont need the prereq class

71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T03:45:21.457000+00:00) : the problem is there are too many other good veno sets
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T03:41:50.505000+00:00) : the brewmaster one is really good though too bad it's a shit hero
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T03:39:59.243000+00:00) : and it's the only set for him so that gives it some value

71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T03:38:11.849000+00:00) : i stared at it for 10 seconds initially trying to figure out hwat hero it was fore

71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T02:05:24.651000+00:00) : 😦 you didnt answer my question
71716577669550080 (2017-05-27T02:02:43.208000+00:00) : whata re you doing here
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T22:11:55.615000+00:00) : its  like stardew valley but for golfing
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T21:07:20.184000+00:00) : I'm somehow intrigued by a game about golf
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T21:06:51.921000+00:00) : http://golfstorygame.com/
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T19:08:32.051000+00:00) : yeah because now i cant ever get another healer unless i happen to find one that wants to join me in a town or if one of my other mages somehow learns a healing move
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T19:07:31.093000+00:00) : yeah i think not having marriage means you have to be closer with the guys you do have because you cant have them make new babies
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T19:04:58.235000+00:00) : fates?
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T19:04:53.392000+00:00) : what last game
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T19:03:21.774000+00:00) : brb gotta go breed me some new fire emblem characters
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T19:03:05.362000+00:00) : lol "Character relationships are still in the game, but I was somewhat relieved to find that it has no marriage or children. While I’ve enjoyed getting the most bang for my buck with these mechanics, not having them actually upped the challenge and tension during battle for me. Even with two different armies, my forces weren’t unlimited! Not being able to breed replacements made me that much more careful with my battle tactics."
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T19:01:02.735000+00:00) : at least on amazon
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T19:00:53.906000+00:00) : it was only 60 but it was out of stock until may 29th
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T18:59:35.410000+00:00) : it came with a reversible original nes gaiden cover
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T18:59:17.716000+00:00) : ugh i regret not buying the limited edition of fire emblem
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T18:49:05.326000+00:00) : these are like tights for your arms
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T18:48:59.962000+00:00) : shit keenan https://twitter.com/EBGamesCanada/status/868151579219816448
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T18:47:18.860000+00:00) : which is funny
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T18:47:05.568000+00:00) : stories is just pokemon though
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T18:45:49.354000+00:00) : i mean it's just the same exact concept as most mmorpgs but on a smaller scale
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T18:44:22.185000+00:00) : i think thats kind of the point of monster hunters stories
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T18:40:51.133000+00:00) : that breeding game coming out for the 3ds im actually interested in
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T18:40:39.353000+00:00) : idk i think they're pretty cool
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T18:38:01.759000+00:00) : i dont really know if that type of gameplay is for me but it's obviously very popular for a reason
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T18:36:42.212000+00:00) : so if you like continuously upgrading your gear, fighting cool boss monsters, and complex real time combat systems, then that's pretty much monster hunter
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T18:35:30.676000+00:00) : it's literally just an 1-4 player mmorpg with only the raiding and boss fighting components
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T18:34:09.444000+00:00) : thanks capcom
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T18:33:53.054000+00:00) : lol the monster hunter announcement increased nintendo market value by 2.2 billion overnight
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:57:41.308000+00:00) : About your typically adventure length
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:57:14.490000+00:00) : For an adventure
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:57:04.903000+00:00) : Sounds like a good length
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:56:23.374000+00:00) : Is it a year long
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:56:14.481000+00:00) : How many​days did there end up being
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:55:38.716000+00:00) : Can't you just date everyone and get all the perks
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:52:24.544000+00:00) : Yeah you could have gotten unlimited free palm readings
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:51:14.328000+00:00) : But I just need to remember it was her fault and she deserved it
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:50:57.392000+00:00) : I already feel bad
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:50:51.085000+00:00) : I'm going to regret killing my mage the rest of the game
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:48:44.858000+00:00) : Belieeeeeve
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:48:09.489000+00:00) : Gj
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:48:06.402000+00:00) : Ok
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:47:01.535000+00:00) : Because that's doesn't seem very realistic
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:46:49.790000+00:00) : Just curious
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:46:45.449000+00:00) : Then how do you kill God with a toy
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:45:55.298000+00:00) : I thought they were toys
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:45:47.072000+00:00) : That's dumb how there are guns
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:45:14.661000+00:00) : Thanks
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:44:06.977000+00:00) : Oh right he ded
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:43:45.758000+00:00) : With God?
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:42:40.942000+00:00) : Except now I don't have any healer so I'm kind of fucked for the rest of the game i think
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:42:17.882000+00:00) : I don't feel bad
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:42:14.957000+00:00) : So she basically killed herself
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:42:07.816000+00:00) : All she needed to do was hit her lifestealer spell once so she would survive the next hit but noooooo
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:41:21.140000+00:00) : She was my healer but I undid the moves 4 times and she missed her attack everytime so she deserved to die
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:40:44.845000+00:00) : I let a person die keenan
71716577669550080 (2017-05-26T08:39:34.735000+00:00) : Same.

71716577669550080 (2017-05-24T22:18:20.627000+00:00) : Wow.
71716577669550080 (2017-05-24T21:46:41.311000+00:00) : I bet I could get less dialogue though if I just killed off all the major characters

71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T03:32:26.406000+00:00) : keenan literally everytime they publish an episode they say it's bonkers
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:52:22.194000+00:00) : 60 dollars later i finally got to level 249
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:47:37.242000+00:00) : oh boy
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:45:05.195000+00:00) : np
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:43:02.578000+00:00) : <@!125452744440938497>
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:38:37.636000+00:00) : want to play?
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:30:02.904000+00:00) : also i have no patience
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:29:34.040000+00:00) : which effectively lowers the value
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:29:23.660000+00:00) : i thought about that but then i would be missing out on all the stuff i get in between like extra tokens and effects
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:28:40.147000+00:00) : I did say i would buy an arcana if io ever got one but i didnt expect it to happen like this
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:27:50.497000+00:00) : asher should i get the io arcana
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:09:34.149000+00:00) : so it isnt just a normal show thats what you're telling me
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:07:52.143000+00:00) : if i saw this in a show without any context i would probably just ignore it and forget it happened
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:05:52.027000+00:00) : because on the outside it just seems like any other tv drama
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:05:27.847000+00:00) : i just kind of wanted to know why you guys liked it because wikipedia cant tell me that part
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:04:41.317000+00:00) : ok thats what i thought
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:03:52.362000+00:00) : this is why i just assume you always do weird shit and was surprised
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:02:58.548000+00:00) : i know you are messing with me but i'd like a non-sarcastic response
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:02:34.350000+00:00) : see this is the type of shit
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:00:58.890000+00:00) : i thought it was a direct continuation of the 25 year old seasons
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T02:00:01.718000+00:00) : i'd imagine it's not something i could get into into without the previous stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T01:59:50.287000+00:00) : i cant tell if thats a trick or not
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T01:58:55.909000+00:00) : anyways I usually assume you guys do weird stuff when im not around but nope i guess this is just a normal show that normal people watch
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T01:58:16.624000+00:00) : and this is all in preparation for the renewal of the show in a few days?
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T01:58:03.269000+00:00) : i see
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T01:57:28.678000+00:00) : before the new stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T01:57:25.067000+00:00) : or are they airing the old seasons again
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T01:57:16.220000+00:00) : how were you watching it yesterday
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T01:56:59.672000+00:00) : what show
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T01:55:00.992000+00:00) : sounds like it could also be the original content too
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T01:54:43.236000+00:00) : oh
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T01:53:55.641000+00:00) : oh you meant original content
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T01:52:28.375000+00:00) : oc?
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T01:51:32.984000+00:00) : i cant believe you guys are just watching a normal tv show
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T01:51:24.459000+00:00) : i just looked it up and twin peaks is just a normal tv drama
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T00:57:35.176000+00:00) : we could also ask in the iu gaming discord
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T00:52:16.911000+00:00) : and built his own computer
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T00:52:09.627000+00:00) : he owned several amiibo so he must be cool
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T00:51:24.767000+00:00) : idk i could ask

71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T00:50:43.268000+00:00) : also roger knows someone who has a roommate who plays dota that ive never met but ive based on his apartment that i visited he seemed cool
71716577669550080 (2017-05-19T00:45:48.775000+00:00) : im pretty sure about half the people in my apartment play dota but i ont know how many of them would read this

71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T23:21:49.210000+00:00) : this should be under gameplay
71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T23:21:40.666000+00:00) : the other tab is much broader
71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T23:19:36.769000+00:00) : like lore stuff such as "the way" and general mechanics like "hearts"
71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T23:19:09.515000+00:00) : whats a good name for a page about things that dont fit into any of our gameplay categories

71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T23:11:56.522000+00:00) : maybe he thinks thats the purpose of a manager

71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T23:04:24.316000+00:00) : yeah it was mentioned in the tutorial i think
71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T23:03:09.392000+00:00) : the vineguard is what tumbleseed rolls on

71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T19:21:23.853000+00:00) : i thought they were just for a neat stat
71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T19:21:06.687000+00:00) : you're asking in the wrong chat
71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T19:19:42.326000+00:00) : distance first, then speed for ties
71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T19:19:34.277000+00:00) : i think it's just distance
71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T19:17:57.135000+00:00) : 10:16!!

71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T19:15:31.120000+00:00) : like the reverse

71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T19:05:06.199000+00:00) : or it could be 1

71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T19:02:22.852000+00:00) : its hard to give them personalities if they are clans
71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T19:01:55.479000+00:00) : clones
71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T18:57:48.855000+00:00) : i think they should be individuals
71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T18:47:40.573000+00:00) : as their profession
71716577669550080 (2017-05-08T18:47:38.336000+00:00) : some seeds definitely have to be dedicated plankers

71716577669550080 (2017-04-28T01:18:33.860000+00:00) : They have like 2 other vids besides Mario kart in this series

71716577669550080 (2017-04-28T01:13:59.319000+00:00) : If it's not already a regular thing
71716577669550080 (2017-04-28T01:13:45.213000+00:00) : They should make parody game reviews a regular thing because there's so much shit game journalists say that you can make fun of
71716577669550080 (2017-04-28T01:13:07.390000+00:00) : Yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-04-28T01:12:24.819000+00:00) : They should become a real video game reviewing site
71716577669550080 (2017-04-28T01:12:08.087000+00:00) : They make a lot of great points in that video

71716577669550080 (2017-04-27T18:43:52.100000+00:00) : impressive
71716577669550080 (2017-04-27T18:43:50.403000+00:00) : they've been in stock for like 45 minutes now
71716577669550080 (2017-04-27T18:43:39.470000+00:00) : amazon just got a really large shipment of switches
71716577669550080 (2017-04-27T16:34:59.982000+00:00) : LD cast PogChamp
71716577669550080 (2017-04-27T16:21:17.915000+00:00) : although actually maybe he was at a lan when he played for c9 for a couple months
71716577669550080 (2017-04-27T16:19:59.962000+00:00) : jesus i just realized it's been almost 3 years since mason was last at a lan
71716577669550080 (2017-04-27T16:07:21.548000+00:00) : mason has at least 5 different memes
71716577669550080 (2017-04-27T16:07:01.197000+00:00) : but the combined bulba demon and mason memes far make up for it
71716577669550080 (2017-04-27T16:06:13.095000+00:00) : every player has their own meme except for abed and dubu

71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T23:40:57.772000+00:00) : hey asher
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T22:07:38.277000+00:00) : i think it should be hard for the first few weeks but then it gets easy and thats where it's less frustrating
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T22:07:12.180000+00:00) : well i know but i just dont want to invest time in only a 2-3 week thing
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T22:06:05.243000+00:00) : why do we have to do a temp thing
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T22:05:42.983000+00:00) : i also dont want resources to be finite, but just very hard to get
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T22:03:41.437000+00:00) : like i dont want it to remain hard for the entire map, i want eventually to acheive something big under the strenuous conditions
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T22:02:46.806000+00:00) : the only thin that im concerned about with this mod is the expansion potential after you overcome the initial difficulty curve
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T22:01:39.299000+00:00) : oh we've been chatting in here
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T21:08:49.490000+00:00) : Why
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T21:08:46.858000+00:00) : Lol
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T21:04:46.807000+00:00) : Why
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T21:04:44.859000+00:00) : Lol
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T20:44:11.919000+00:00) : They are actually pretty low tier key chains so i was kind of disappointed
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T20:43:11.388000+00:00) : So couldn't pass that up
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T20:43:05.497000+00:00) : But I literally collect key chains
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T20:42:40.634000+00:00) : I would have gotten digital without the keychains
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T20:42:15.284000+00:00) : But my point is that it didn't matter overall since prime is great
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T20:41:56.689000+00:00) : Two keychains
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T20:40:56.284000+00:00) : Switch retail is 10 more but amazon discount makes it the same price as the other versions plus you get the keychains
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T20:40:15.288000+00:00) : The PS4 version is the same price as switch digital
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T20:39:52.056000+00:00) : Thanks Amazon
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T20:39:47.358000+00:00) : It also came a day early
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T20:39:38.779000+00:00) : Yeah duh it's cheaper
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T20:39:13.355000+00:00) : No because I got them
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T20:36:31.274000+00:00) : I know when
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T20:32:17.851000+00:00) : Who's going to win

71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T13:32:12.903000+00:00) : also what are your bracket predictions?
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T13:31:51.414000+00:00) : they should eliminate some teams during the group stage, like the ones that lost all three series
71716577669550080 (2017-04-26T13:31:37.342000+00:00) : yeah it's a little strange

71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:20:05.881000+00:00) : oh i accidentally did it when i put my phone in my pocket

71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:18:43.284000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:16:50.923000+00:00) : Fuck no roller coaster is going on the island
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:09:27.234000+00:00) : it would also be cool if there were npcs that we could make do stuff for us
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:08:27.813000+00:00) : i want a mod that lets me make actual roller coaster tracks like loops
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:08:04.711000+00:00) : and i want roller coaster
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:07:57.338000+00:00) : not glide
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:07:54.654000+00:00) : i just want something that lets me fly
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:06:02.318000+00:00) : theres literally a minecraft mod for everything
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:05:54.786000+00:00) : ronald
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:05:31.100000+00:00) : like iron and diamons and whatever new ore they add
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:05:20.987000+00:00) : vanilla tools may become obsolete but i think the industrial tools will still require a lot of basic vanilla resources to craft
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:04:47.702000+00:00) : and just make roller coaster tycoon
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:04:35.219000+00:00) : but above the island is just a massive roller coaster
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:04:28.362000+00:00) : guys we should have this island
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:03:41.661000+00:00) : oh boy a whole hour
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:03:17.284000+00:00) : they dont really break once you start enchanting
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:01:44.730000+00:00) : im pretty sure you need like 50 diamonds in minecraft before you're good on tools for the rest of the game
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:01:04.356000+00:00) : even on the last server, the fact that you had 700 diamonds didnt really help you at all
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:00:51.650000+00:00) : ronald i think the point of this server is that ore wouldn't be that important
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T20:00:11.545000+00:00) : its kind of hard to have separate properties when space is so limited
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:59:45.130000+00:00) : im pretty sure with an island onlt 500 blocks wide we would all end up sharing resources anyway
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:58:49.452000+00:00) : but not without work first
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:58:42.853000+00:00) : and it just becomes creative
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:58:35.928000+00:00) : so that eventually we would get to the point where resources are completely free
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:58:25.480000+00:00) : actually maybe tech and more farming automation would be cool
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:57:38.598000+00:00) : there would be trade but only between the four of us
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:57:24.182000+00:00) : see but i feel like this map structure would be interesting even without mods
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:55:11.895000+00:00) : or start expanding the island with dirt
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:54:59.886000+00:00) : also if we had just an island with water in every other direction we could eventually industrialize the entire thing and make a big city out of it
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:42:22.288000+00:00) : so like 450
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:40:07.851000+00:00) : that would be so useful
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:39:45.651000+00:00) : to run websites or minecraft servers off of
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:39:37.651000+00:00) : and have a server i can ssh to whenever
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:39:23.654000+00:00) : i think i want to build a 300-500 always on linux box
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:37:10.541000+00:00) : lol this weekend will be us going to comic conventions by day and configuring minecraft servers by night
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:33:50.241000+00:00) : 90% wiki reading 10% playing
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:33:38.915000+00:00) : there will be a lot of wiki reading
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:33:34.714000+00:00) : still takes time to learn
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:32:35.247000+00:00) : the whole point of minecraft is to have something to do when you are focusing on other things
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:31:37.471000+00:00) : i can just do shit
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:31:32.635000+00:00) : part of the reason vanilla minecraft is so appealing for me is that im so good at it that it doesnt take any consideration to play
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:30:33.730000+00:00) : takes effort
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:30:28.788000+00:00) : like a whole new game
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:30:23.307000+00:00) : tahts so much learning
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:29:57.497000+00:00) : im too much of a minecraft purist to have any good ideas about mods
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:27:21.285000+00:00) : but give me money, a map, and some mods and i can set it up in chicago
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:26:02.057000+00:00) : but no it ded
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:25:55.647000+00:00) : yeah but i thought the map was still alive just hidden somewhere in the vast cloud
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:25:19.023000+00:00) : give me a minute to mourne
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:25:13.081000+00:00) : yo when you lose a dear child you dont just go make a new one right away
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:22:18.148000+00:00) : :'''''''''''''''''''(
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:22:07.659000+00:00) : :((((((((((((((
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:21:30.351000+00:00) : yeah because it went poof
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:21:17.094000+00:00) : we werent going to use it again but it has sentimental value
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:21:02.623000+00:00) : the latest version i have of it is probably when i transferred from amazon to google
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:20:42.483000+00:00) : rip map
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:20:33.079000+00:00) : rip
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:18:56.817000+00:00) : i think i deleted the disk too instead of making a backup
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:18:34.053000+00:00) : i completely delteed it because google was still charging me for the persistant disk
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:11:38.734000+00:00) : i think when i terminated the instance i forgot to save a snapshot of it locally
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:11:15.875000+00:00) : i dont care as much about the map as I do about the infrustructure I set up behind it like the auto-updating online world map
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T19:04:10.783000+00:00) : fuck i hope i have all the data from the old server still saved somewhere
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T18:58:26.448000+00:00) : but i think google cloud might be better pricing wise
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T18:58:04.869000+00:00) : or if ronald buys an ec2 instance for textin we can use that
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T18:54:28.256000+00:00) : with mods or whateever you want
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T18:54:23.023000+00:00) : if anyone wants to pay me to set up a server i will again
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T12:55:50.178000+00:00) : i wanted to select abed for some things but couldnt
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T12:55:43.573000+00:00) : not for the player stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T01:58:13.659000+00:00) : im offended
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T01:58:11.710000+00:00) : new DC isnt even an option for them
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T01:57:59.575000+00:00) : i just did my predictions
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T01:53:57.474000+00:00) : <@!127535721857679362> <@!125452744440938497> dota?
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T01:01:25.102000+00:00) : holy shit this instrumentation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0No1WPXWEis
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:59:06.715000+00:00) : a cpu would be hard to borrow
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:58:22.213000+00:00) : the car lacks the required immersion
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:58:16.382000+00:00) : probably not
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:56:11.371000+00:00) : and go back to his roots
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:55:59.502000+00:00) : link can fuck around all he wants in the 100 hours leading up to the fight but when he actually begins the fight he has to keep it classy
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:54:38.340000+00:00) : i have to beat the game as the classic hero
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:54:27.915000+00:00) : because they give you links original tunic
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:54:18.473000+00:00) : no thats the whole point of getting the shrines
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:53:24.105000+00:00) : like can you imagine if this were real and you had just woken up and everyone was counting on you to save the world but then you didnt train hard enough and just die
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:52:10.031000+00:00) : that's been dead for 100 years
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:52:04.054000+00:00) : it makes it seem like im some epic hero
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:51:56.878000+00:00) : i also enjoy the feeling of being overpowered
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:51:26.680000+00:00) : trust me i dont just leave ganons roaming around in the wild like that
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:51:09.221000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:51:01.915000+00:00) : and i refuse to look them up
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:50:50.158000+00:00) : i have 8 left
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:50:45.891000+00:00) : well i have to get all the shrines first
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:50:14.082000+00:00) : thats only because shovel knight is a good game
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:49:21.914000+00:00) : ug why couldnt mario kart come out 6 days sooner so i could play mario kart while in a car
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:47:12.511000+00:00) : <@!125452744440938497> also did you get this one since it was on sale today https://9to5toys.com/2017/04/19/samsung-850-evo/

71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:44:47.972000+00:00) : or you could just download it from youtube
71716577669550080 (2017-04-20T00:43:41.325000+00:00) : yes he got the psecial edition
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T01:52:51.575000+00:00) : so i can least start the queue
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T01:52:46.015000+00:00) : yo join my party

71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T01:32:39.553000+00:00) : <@!127535721857679362> also ronald we should call
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T01:22:51.472000+00:00) : <@!125452744440938497> dota?
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:35:38.129000+00:00) : lol next time
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:32:59.306000+00:00) : which is why nier doesnt look as great graphically as some other ps4 games because they needed to hit 60 fps
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:32:42.957000+00:00) : framerate is still important in singeplayer for a lot of games
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:31:41.564000+00:00) : graphics dont matter but framerate actually does affect gameplay
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:31:28.620000+00:00) : also for a lot of games framerate is really important
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:28:49.719000+00:00) : it doesnt affect gameplay at all but it's still neat to look at
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:28:41.445000+00:00) : like with skyrim mods
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:28:36.435000+00:00) : also i think you start to appreciate graphics more when you have the capability to run them
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:26:49.034000+00:00) : unless you only watch netflix and check email
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:26:43.875000+00:00) : so i think it's always a good investment
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:26:29.493000+00:00) : true but a powerful computer is useful for things other than gaming
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:25:17.629000+00:00) : but yeah thats convenient
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:25:13.160000+00:00) : there are many reasons for having a gaming capable pc besides those things
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:20:23.102000+00:00) : yeah!
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:18:49.571000+00:00) : only dota boys would understand
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:15:39.226000+00:00) : thats what i thought ronald would do when he got a new computer but im pretty sure he actually went down in mmr because he prefers 24fps
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:15:07.154000+00:00) : asher what if you instantly become 6k because of 60 fps
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:11:06.198000+00:00) : in fact, i'd say it happens about once every 16 weeks
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:10:45.049000+00:00) : this whole week is extremely rare
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:10:39.449000+00:00) : i only have 2 assignments due this week
71716577669550080 (2017-04-19T00:10:10.369000+00:00) : *extremely* rare

71716577669550080 (2017-04-15T00:25:41.965000+00:00) : i dont think nvidia's grant funds the xp yet
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T23:45:20.546000+00:00) : but we dont want to build a whole new computer for it so i'll probably just stick it in mine at home
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T23:45:00.858000+00:00) : because we need a card that is good at doing deep learning
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T23:44:41.868000+00:00) : im actually going to apply for a grant soon to get a titan x for research purposes
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T22:53:35.108000+00:00) : i doubt your cpu is more that 50 degrees celsius under load ronald
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T22:53:14.126000+00:00) : also keeping the computer not on the floor helps immensly with dust
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T22:53:04.090000+00:00) : yeah you should
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T22:52:57.450000+00:00) : you're thinking in celsius right?
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T22:51:39.779000+00:00) : mine never gets above 35-40 degrees and i think some people have like 50 average so there's definitely a lot of leway there
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T22:51:03.516000+00:00) : im also pretty sure any air cooler that isnt a stock cooler can adequately cool your cpu even if it's overclocked a bit
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T22:48:28.491000+00:00) : yeah i bumped it up a little i think
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T22:28:28.226000+00:00) : im not even overclocking that much because i didnt want to stress anything out
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T22:28:12.413000+00:00) : i kind of regret it though because i think it's unecessary
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T22:27:55.403000+00:00) : no i use aio liquid
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T22:25:56.001000+00:00) : i5 6600k overclocked to 4.2/4.3
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T21:07:42.400000+00:00) : half my build was corsair products
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T21:07:36.425000+00:00) : https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0134EW7G8/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T21:00:49.716000+00:00) : i wonder if prices went up
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T21:00:40.501000+00:00) : but im looking at the exact model i got and now it's 119
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T21:00:25.119000+00:00) : i feel like mine was more like 95
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T21:00:16.627000+00:00) : oh i guess you're right on ram
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T20:58:02.103000+00:00) : but i get you on the buying stuff part
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T20:57:36.385000+00:00) : im pretty sure your ram is extremely overpriced
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T17:14:27.904000+00:00) : that new star wars trailer was almost as epic as the botw one
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T17:05:06.183000+00:00) : classic jrpg
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T17:05:02.114000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T17:04:47.033000+00:00) : get to play what
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T17:01:52.445000+00:00) : it's by one of my favorite developers
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T17:01:46.835000+00:00) : this game is going to be great
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T17:01:40.708000+00:00) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_cfPNbwIUI
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:57:46.256000+00:00) : I think you'd actually have to talk with him to find out
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:57:11.749000+00:00) : I really dont know
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:56:58.986000+00:00) : sure but he may also just have some fundamentally different beliefs in what he thinks you can and cant learn
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:53:12.276000+00:00) : I dont think he really cares about his image on facebook because otherwise he wouldnt be doing it there
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:51:31.982000+00:00) : I think he really cares, its just a not something he's explored a lot yet and hasnt done every opportunity out there. In time he may participate in more facilitated discussions outside of facebook and I guarantee you that this past week he's been thinking adn reading about it a lot
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:47:05.124000+00:00) : I can see that but at the very least they should be  more respectful about it
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:43:23.604000+00:00) : because they are against discourse
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:43:16.096000+00:00) : maybe the reason why he hasnt shut up is because no one is willing to tell him whats wrong about his academic perspective
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:42:23.829000+00:00) : because i think you're just making assumptions here
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:42:17.733000+00:00) : well maybe you should actually talk with him
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:41:20.561000+00:00) : just because he's not one of the opressed doesnt mean he doesnt care about the issues
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:40:50.642000+00:00) : he's almost certainly very invested in it
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:40:43.052000+00:00) : you cant call him not invested in it when you have never talked to him
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:40:30.175000+00:00) : but the people who do get to decide whats racist or sexist dont allow any leway for changing their mind on those things. like I think he's just frustrated by the fact that some people seem to arbitrarily call things racist or sexist without any solid ground behind it just because it's what they heard through the media or other people. from his point of view there should be a logical reason behind all that and in charles murray's case there really isnt
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:35:22.728000+00:00) : I understand that he doesnt get to decide what exactly is racist or sexist
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:33:51.190000+00:00) : he has literary experience
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:32:47.602000+00:00) : presenting a counter-argument in a polite way is opressive?
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:31:55.158000+00:00) : I dont think so,  I think he's just trying to let people see the usefulness of good discussion. and its hard for him to do that because everytime he talks hes "opressing" them
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:30:30.876000+00:00) : that probably didnt make sense
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:30:17.315000+00:00) : that he wants to correct
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:30:10.721000+00:00) : yes I know and roger also knows that but I think for him, he sees a fundamental flaw in the nature how the people he's talking with reply to his discussions
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:26:40.806000+00:00) : its just giving him more attention and a larger platform while at the same time not allowing discourse on the topic
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:25:20.072000+00:00) : fine but if you dont have that accessibility then you shouldn't be spending time doing things like protesting something you dont understand because that accomplishes nothing
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:23:42.520000+00:00) : what do you mean accessibility
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:22:58.988000+00:00) : if anything, having him speak a good way to encourage thoughtful discussion on the topic that ends up being better for everyone
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:22:34.144000+00:00) : I get that but in this case the people in the culture are barely educated on what they are protesting against. Like if you don't like his views, instead of preventing him from speaking, you should listen and challenge him directly on it. thats how people's ideas develop and evolve. if murray has bad ideas and they are never challenged they will just stay that way
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:15:40.359000+00:00) : many of the people protesting charles murray havent even read his stuff, they just see one article calling him a racist and a sexist and cling on to that, and then someone like roger actually spends time researching all sides of it because he wants the full story. if anything that makes him more qualified to discuss it
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:14:29.897000+00:00) : I do not see how that's true
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:13:24.254000+00:00) : on one side you have people who are stuck in their understanding of the politics and dont like to be challenged and on the other side you have people who wont be able to understand because they arent allowed to
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T16:12:18.799000+00:00) : If that's true then it's ends up being bad for both sides
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T15:16:49.666000+00:00) : like it's the only thing you can do
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T15:16:41.149000+00:00) : and i think that discussion when you arent affected by it at all with someone who is is one of the best ways to get see the others viewpoint more clearly as if you were in that position
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T15:15:28.484000+00:00) : the problem is that every time he even attempts to look at opposing views and have a rational discussion, he gets shut down and called a sexist
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T15:14:48.357000+00:00) : I think he would far prefer it if he wasnt getting emotional responses and if he could actually have a real discussion
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T14:59:53.261000+00:00) : How is it elitist bullshit
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T14:58:37.889000+00:00) : He's frustrated by the state of discourse on campus
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T14:58:05.249000+00:00) : Why is that yikes
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T14:57:44.024000+00:00) : He says he enjoys being frustrated by people who are so close minded like that
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T02:03:11.547000+00:00) : good sign
71716577669550080 (2017-04-14T02:03:07.940000+00:00) : all the successful people are playing the games i like

71716577669550080 (2017-04-13T00:32:41.633000+00:00) : it also has split screen but the other consoles have that too

71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T17:14:50.498000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T17:14:08.565000+00:00) : and you have very different views
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T17:14:01.998000+00:00) : because you've both had involvement in it via clubs
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T17:13:44.543000+00:00) : like a formal one
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T17:13:39.941000+00:00) : ronald i think you and roger should have a debate
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T17:11:18.309000+00:00) : ya
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T17:08:25.515000+00:00) : he definitely didnt anticipate it though
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T17:08:18.329000+00:00) : i think he enjoys it though because it's a mental exercise and he likes debating
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T16:54:45.263000+00:00) : its under one of shailey's posts
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T04:28:44.603000+00:00) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpO4z0ycJb8

71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:29:23.990000+00:00) : not an auto dealership
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:29:20.277000+00:00) : ah
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:28:48.770000+00:00) : brb googling lincoln-douglass
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:27:52.993000+00:00) : im glad he finally ended it
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:27:48.955000+00:00) : i literally told him that if it were me, I would have stopped the discussion a long time ago and that you werent getting anywhere like that
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:26:37.734000+00:00) : it just maybe wasnt very constructive on facebook and with those people
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:26:28.139000+00:00) : there's definitely merit to learning through discussion though
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:25:29.202000+00:00) : so maybe he'll follow up
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:25:24.594000+00:00) : to be fair he did ask those girls for reading material
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:24:50.228000+00:00) : well yeah i never talk about him
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:24:34.154000+00:00) : which is the only thing
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:24:26.232000+00:00) : except for the desire to learn of course
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:24:12.955000+00:00) : also i realized i have like nothing in common with roger
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:24:04.053000+00:00) : we are always to busy and never really see each other
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:23:39.403000+00:00) : tonight was actually the first night we've talked in like 2 weeks
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:23:30.976000+00:00) : hes not
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:21:18.468000+00:00) : a lot of people lack that these days
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:21:09.833000+00:00) : and to be intellectual
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:20:53.559000+00:00) : i admire his desire to learn
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:20:10.460000+00:00) : to be fair
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:20:04.635000+00:00) : thats probably what they are
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:18:05.406000+00:00) : but thats definitely just his style and his formal debate training
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:17:51.571000+00:00) : yeah it might not be the best for a facebook setting
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:14:09.087000+00:00) : i think it's better to be polite and formal than abrasive
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:12:57.074000+00:00) : prove yourself
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:12:53.795000+00:00) : keenan now is your chance to correct that
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:11:09.528000+00:00) : because he's such an upstanding community member
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:11:02.034000+00:00) : i bet asher would go even if his gf and me werent involved in organizing it
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:09:45.938000+00:00) : you can come at 9:30 and then leave early
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:09:33.663000+00:00) : come to the conference
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:09:31.022000+00:00) : anyway keenan
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:06:59.286000+00:00) : I cant wait until the switch game about cars 3 comes out
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:04:29.231000+00:00) : and it seemed like people didnt understand that
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:03:56.907000+00:00) : hes just a boy seeking information
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:03:45.275000+00:00) : because he wasnt going to convince anyone
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:03:30.037000+00:00) : and i actually agreed with him but i told him it was useless to keep debating it
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:03:08.799000+00:00) : later on in the debate it just became very meta
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:02:11.196000+00:00) : thats not a forum troll though
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T03:00:25.169000+00:00) : he only seeks understanding it's not like he is maliciously doing it
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T02:59:50.598000+00:00) : i strongly disagree with that
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T02:58:45.016000+00:00) : and talking to roger about it actually
71716577669550080 (2017-04-12T02:58:36.505000+00:00) : i know i was just reading that

71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T17:58:46.728000+00:00) : woah
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T17:54:10.393000+00:00) : i cant tell if serious
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:28:51.335000+00:00) : and i think it actually innovates on the genre
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:28:42.925000+00:00) : that game looks really cool too
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:28:34.870000+00:00) : have you heard of a hat in time?
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:28:12.904000+00:00) : i dont think i can resist a colorful ninteno-like game
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:27:58.593000+00:00) : i actually want yooka laylee now
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:24:04.228000+00:00) : sounds like he needs to start his own comic series
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:21:52.300000+00:00) : lol wut
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:19:11.889000+00:00) : no wonder it was recalled
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:18:01.880000+00:00) : why does kitty pryde look like she has a beard
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:16:51.007000+00:00) : '
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:15:26.644000+00:00) : it was probably problematic because it didnt contain enough wolverine
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:02:48.624000+00:00) : like the whole experience between the colors, sounds, rumble, is just really satisfying
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:02:33.333000+00:00) : its really cool
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:02:27.274000+00:00) : and the rumble is subtle but it clearly adds a different texture to each weapon
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:01:55.662000+00:00) : when you pull off a huge combo
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:01:48.568000+00:00) : it's extremely satisfying
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:01:39.661000+00:00) : its going to make me really good at nier
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:01:28.338000+00:00) : it's also beautiful
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:01:15.761000+00:00) : it's like the perfect mobile switch game
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:01:03.046000+00:00) : graceful explosion machine
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T16:00:53.157000+00:00) : you know whats also a really good indie game that i just got
71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T15:59:08.141000+00:00) : i also really like the art style

71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T15:54:10.505000+00:00) : once you realize that, there's no real pnealty for dying besides frustration

71716577669550080 (2017-04-11T15:53:26.185000+00:00) : like it forces me to use money wisely and spend it in smart ways such that I never have too much surplus to lose

71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:29:01.038000+00:00) : what if
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:21:17.164000+00:00) : make a note
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:16:25.031000+00:00) : rip adventure mode
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:16:21.189000+00:00) : yes but that was just brawl
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:15:55.880000+00:00) : lol it would be funny to see smash's system in a normal platformer or something
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:15:03.221000+00:00) : yeah because the game is really easy if you dont care about points but if you dont have points you just look bad
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:14:19.361000+00:00) : kirby's epic yarn has the same system as sonic
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:09:07.505000+00:00) : thats what would happen if i tried to make a game so i can relate
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:05:40.090000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:05:28.052000+00:00) : now it has like 3 people working on it
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:05:08.571000+00:00) : minecraft only had like 2 people working on it for 4 years before it officially released
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:03:41.625000+00:00) : why dont you email him about it
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:03:11.240000+00:00) : now it's in prebeta
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:03:06.983000+00:00) : in 50 years i'll be telling my grandkids that i remember when df was in pre-aplha
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:02:45.647000+00:00) : mhmm
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:02:28.703000+00:00) : but with 3d graphics and multiplayer
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:02:12.991000+00:00) : like imagine of you combine the two
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:02:06.682000+00:00) : yeah but they lack what minecraft has of fine tuning and crafting every detail of each building
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T16:01:18.685000+00:00) : probably because the suite of tools for that would be so huge
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:55:56.059000+00:00) : if i had a ps4 it would have two games, dq builders and persona 5
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:55:41.347000+00:00) : i want to play dq builders
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:54:42.816000+00:00) : yeah true
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:54:09.236000+00:00) : which is why the switch would run it better
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:54:04.031000+00:00) : also your laptop and my laptop dont have dedicated graphics cards
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:53:40.179000+00:00) : idk
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:53:39.475000+00:00) : we'll see
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:53:36.375000+00:00) : would be fun
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:53:34.318000+00:00) : idk i could maybe play it on switch
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:53:22.163000+00:00) : yeah weird
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:52:52.475000+00:00) : but still
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:52:30.776000+00:00) : my laptop battery is more important for stuff other than for games. also i cant play it on a bus on a train on a plane on a couch upside down
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:51:01.648000+00:00) : also its weird how a lot of kids have only played portable minecraft on phones
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:50:35.927000+00:00) : laptop minecraft will have lower performance and render distance than swithc
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:50:01.080000+00:00) : ive never experienced that before
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:49:50.291000+00:00) : portable minecraft
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:49:45.088000+00:00) : i just realized
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:49:42.218000+00:00) : oh fuck
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:49:17.324000+00:00) : yes
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:48:58.192000+00:00) : but lego games are always better multiplayer
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:48:52.157000+00:00) : as in not primarily multiplayer
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:48:41.258000+00:00) : oh shit thats a singleplayer game
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:48:34.623000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:47:13.050000+00:00) : whats the difference
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:46:49.630000+00:00) : yeah yes my favorite nintendo game
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:45:27.252000+00:00) : actually i guess fire emblem is a thing
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:45:06.330000+00:00) : so technically not until mario
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:44:58.042000+00:00) : which i wont even buy
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:44:48.155000+00:00) : i just realized nintendo isnt going to release another single player game until xenoblade 2
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:40:22.107000+00:00) : if you want to borrw my wii u for bayonetta 2 let me know
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:39:35.182000+00:00) : i will
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:36:28.565000+00:00) : 3 person indies teams are able to create way better experiences
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:36:15.785000+00:00) : and not by reviewers standards
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:36:08.948000+00:00) : not by my standards
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:35:54.655000+00:00) : that do it way better
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:35:50.817000+00:00) : if you want non-nintendo co-op games there are plenty of other great indie games
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:35:33.054000+00:00) : ok but you cant praise yl for being a good couch co-op game when the couch co-op it has sucks
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:34:48.950000+00:00) : yes keenan
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:34:35.764000+00:00) : and it interrupts normal gameplay
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:34:27.332000+00:00) : because there are parts in the main game where you are forced to play the arcade stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:33:52.692000+00:00) : better to just not include it
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:33:49.104000+00:00) : but they included it and did a lousy job
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:33:33.004000+00:00) : its like just not fun to play
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:33:19.466000+00:00) : no its definitely not purposeful sucking
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:32:50.118000+00:00) : control wise and performance wise
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:32:43.077000+00:00) : yeah and ive heard those suck
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:32:31.357000+00:00) : isnt it just in the arcade games
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:29:04.235000+00:00) : and when it goes on sale
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:28:59.880000+00:00) : if i get it it would be for pc
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:28:21.684000+00:00) : it aint out yet
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:27:36.447000+00:00) : it's pretty cool
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:27:33.226000+00:00) : i played the beta of mr. shifty
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:23:19.764000+00:00) : because like why cant you get those endings on the first run
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:23:03.726000+00:00) : is it obvious how to do the subsequent endings or do you have to look them up
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:22:17.407000+00:00) : OKAY
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:20:13.831000+00:00) : besides the pc of course
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:20:06.987000+00:00) : also for cross platform games the scorpio will be the clear winner
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:19:39.544000+00:00) : you dont even have a 4k tv
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:18:59.326000+00:00) : no i doubt it
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:18:15.375000+00:00) : because of software optimizations that pc doesnt have
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:18:00.364000+00:00) : scorpio will offer better performace than a pc at equivalent price
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:16:15.623000+00:00) : well you dont get those on pc either
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T15:15:44.241000+00:00) : its basically everything you get on pc except less and without steam sales
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T14:42:04.993000+00:00) : and for people who dont want any good games
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T14:40:27.976000+00:00) : because for sure it will run better than a pc at equivalent price
71716577669550080 (2017-04-06T14:40:18.038000+00:00) : no but it seems like a legitimate option for people who want high performance and dont want to build a pc
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T22:52:15.760000+00:00) : even without a finals ticket you can still come for a weekend you just wouldnt be able to watch dotes with us
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T22:51:53.286000+00:00) : <@!127535721857679362> the sooner the better i guess but all i really need to know is if you want a finals ticket or i try to find someone else who will buy it
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T13:17:38.579000+00:00) : We have to determine what to do with the extra set but hopefully it will be for whoever rooms with us
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T13:16:58.552000+00:00) : @<@127535721857679362> not hard to sell especially because most people selling tickets mark up the price a lot. I have 2 midweek and 2 finals and Asher has 1 midweek and 1 finals.
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T05:45:37.799000+00:00) : Lol you can even waste your money on the expensive dota beer bar
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:52:10.169000+00:00) : shouldnt be hard to sell later
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:52:06.377000+00:00) : fuck it, i'll just get two of both just in case
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:50:13.915000+00:00) : <@!127535721857679362> because if you can only come friday-sun youwouldnt be able to come in with us
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:49:40.775000+00:00) : <@!127535721857679362> wait ronald do you want a finals ticket
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:48:39.586000+00:00) : thats weird
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:48:37.861000+00:00) : on my phone, it lets me choose quantity for midweek but for finals it doesnt let me choose anything
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:46:51.251000+00:00) : thats a better idea
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:46:46.826000+00:00) : or wait maybe i should prioritize finals tickets
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:45:31.591000+00:00) : unless you dont get in
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:45:28.949000+00:00) : im planng to get 2 midweek and 1 finals
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:44:53.810000+00:00) : if you dont get in i can also buy your tickets
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:44:39.209000+00:00) : i dont think so but im going to prioritize week tickets and have my computer also open for finals tickets
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:44:02.520000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:36:22.374000+00:00) : i already set up ticket master and have it open on both my phone and computer so im ready to go
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:34:44.379000+00:00) : becuase if it falls through we can always sell the third ticket and go ourselves or  sell all the tickets and not go if rooming is too expensive
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:34:09.758000+00:00) : that way it keeps the most options open
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:34:03.095000+00:00) : well if you do want to stay the whole week i think the best way to go is to buy an extra midweek just in case and try to find someone if not keenan to room with us
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:30:49.761000+00:00) : i wonder if we could find random people on reddit to live with us lol
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:29:55.498000+00:00) : huh
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:29:52.910000+00:00) : oh your right about the plane ticket investment
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:24:50.089000+00:00) : i cant tell he doesnt have interest for dota or doesnt have interest for going to seattle
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:19:27.160000+00:00) : maybe we should just go to the finals and assume ronald will be able to make it
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:13:34.675000+00:00) : <@!125452744440938497> yo asher  what should we do. keenan isnt replying so i dont know if he would even come if we got him a ticket. i dont think the cost of the ticket would even be the problem for him since he would still be paying for travel and living
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:09:25.131000+00:00) : ive been doing an assignment that i thought was due tomorrow but actually isnt due until next week
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:09:10.657000+00:00) : i actually could have played dota
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T04:09:05.486000+00:00) : goddamnit
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T03:11:31.728000+00:00) : no i need to do work right now
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T03:10:46.433000+00:00) : its a 22 minute drive from the airport to key arena
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T03:10:21.547000+00:00) : yeah theres almost certainly a shuttle
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T03:08:03.420000+00:00) : and buses
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T03:08:00.498000+00:00) : they have trains
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T03:07:27.304000+00:00) : im sure we wouldnt
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T03:06:50.529000+00:00) : but we still need keenan to room with us for the other days to cut costs
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T03:06:21.483000+00:00) : yeah maybe
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T03:05:17.633000+00:00) : yeah that doesnt work 😦
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T02:51:26.701000+00:00) : if they only give you a pre-determined stipend for the flight, if the flight from seattle to NC is more than sf to nc then you could probably just pay the difference yourself
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T02:38:30.648000+00:00) : also ronald you can still get tickets just for the finals at least, it seems like you have a decent chance of being able to make it for friday and saturday
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T02:37:55.951000+00:00) : like if keenan went for the first 4 days at least
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T02:37:47.515000+00:00) : if we got an air bnb for 3 people, would they care if we had a fourth staying with us for the second half of the time?
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T02:37:13.113000+00:00) : i dont know about keenan but asher seems willing to fly
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T02:36:26.006000+00:00) : <@!155893986605793281> pls reply
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T02:36:17.753000+00:00) : well not if keenan is there
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T02:35:49.693000+00:00) : but it might be kind of weird if asher and I are inside
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T02:35:37.403000+00:00) : yeah you can watch outside
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T02:02:50.835000+00:00) : the only problem is that i would think it would be kind of a waste for you to get a midweek ticket if you can only come like that thursday or wednesday at the earliest
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T02:00:12.601000+00:00) : i dont think things have to be completely final by tonight, we just need to have tickets tonight. actual living arrangements and travel plans can be made much later in the coming months when you would know your schedule more for sure
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T01:59:20.149000+00:00) : but if we do, we could go ahead and buy a ticket for you and plan on you going, and if you dont go we could always sell the ticket to someone else or make keenan go
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T01:58:41.982000+00:00) : first of all, i think it's unlikely to even get tickets unless we are fast and have no technical issues
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T01:58:03.730000+00:00) : midweek tickets cover the 7-10th and cost 100, and finals tickets cover 11th-12th and cost 200
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T01:57:25.867000+00:00) : TI is from mon 7th until saturday the 12th
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T01:57:03.139000+00:00) : well we would have to buy tickets tonight
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T01:19:59.627000+00:00) : or if that doesnt work out then just refund/sell all the tickets back
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T01:19:44.560000+00:00) : or we could always just go ahead and get a third ticket and try to find someone else to go with us later
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T01:19:12.507000+00:00) : if not then its useless
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T01:19:00.822000+00:00) : i wonder if hed even go if we bought his ticket
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T01:18:49.349000+00:00) : yeah <@!155893986605793281>
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T01:17:17.035000+00:00) : these tips
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T01:17:13.232000+00:00) : we can follow this https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/63dk0n/the_international_2017_ticketing_tips_and/
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T01:16:51.689000+00:00) : yea
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T01:13:14.996000+00:00) : I guess it doesnt hurt to at least try and buy tickets? chances are we wont even be able to
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T00:54:40.669000+00:00) : because its where i might want to go to grad school
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T00:54:34.209000+00:00) : also part of me just really wants to explore seattle
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T00:53:25.688000+00:00) : i wouldnt even be greedy like the ebay scalpers so it would be failrly easy
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T00:53:05.183000+00:00) : because couldnt we technically buy tickets now and then refund them or sell them to someone else later
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T00:52:47.408000+00:00) : i wonder how much buying tickets is a commital
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T00:52:00.698000+00:00) : idk how much shed be interested in it though
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T00:51:48.712000+00:00) : yeah clara could come to TI instead of keenan or in addition to keenan which would make things even cheaper
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T00:51:14.748000+00:00) : oh so not the kiev major
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T00:50:55.965000+00:00) : isnt kiev during school though
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T00:49:07.592000+00:00) : it's definitely possible budget wise to keep everything under 1000
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T00:47:37.323000+00:00) : round trip plane tickets would cost around 400 dollars i think
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T00:43:43.430000+00:00) : which would only cost 100 dollars if he just got a ticket for the mid week games. considering he probably wouldnt be interested in dota that much there's no reason for him to get a finals ticket
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T00:42:44.810000+00:00) : and the only way i think we could get keenan to go is to pay for his TI ticket
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T00:42:18.877000+00:00) : because otherwise lviving would cost 400 each
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T00:42:03.508000+00:00) : i think its only feasible financially with 3+ people
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T00:41:44.937000+00:00) : well i can fly for free and i know that doesnt really help you guys directly, but i could use what i would spend on a ticket to help pay for you
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T00:32:42.379000+00:00) : i did a quick search and it would cost approximately 270 per person (if we had 3) to live in an air bnb for 6 days in seattle
71716577669550080 (2017-04-05T00:32:02.629000+00:00) : <@!125452744440938497> asher what are your thoughts
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:44:46.205000+00:00) : if ronald was our friend you could ask him
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:44:17.818000+00:00) : i just know its the california offices
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:44:08.164000+00:00) : i forgot
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:44:06.933000+00:00) : maybe san fransisco
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:43:49.719000+00:00) : I think at General Electric?
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:43:20.876000+00:00) : also keenan i think you would enjoy it more than you think
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:43:03.853000+00:00) : its too bad ronald's work doesnt end like a week sooner because then he could come straight from california
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:41:57.664000+00:00) : i just think it would be fun if possible
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:41:51.320000+00:00) : but im really not committed enough for that
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:41:40.224000+00:00) : perhaps
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:41:02.206000+00:00) : the reason i want three people to go is mainly to split the costs of living in air bnb or hotel
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:40:27.990000+00:00) : plus you dont even have to buy tickets to TI, you can watch outside on the grass
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:40:17.053000+00:00) : dota would be engaging if you learn it
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:39:03.144000+00:00) : its not the same
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:37:55.504000+00:00) : and to experience esports
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:37:50.430000+00:00) : to hang out in seattle with us
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:33:20.750000+00:00) : if we couldnt go for the whole thing, I think it would be best to go sometime during the week since those tickets are only 100  whereas the final two days are 200
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:32:08.603000+00:00) : keenan you should go
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T23:31:59.246000+00:00) : yeah ronald at best you would make it for one day of the finals
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T21:39:17.214000+00:00) : it would be way more affordable if we could split the cost of living between 3 or 4 people
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T21:37:34.803000+00:00) : what dates
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T21:37:10.737000+00:00) : like between what dates
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T21:37:03.125000+00:00) : ronald when are you working
71716577669550080 (2017-04-04T21:35:45.940000+00:00) : and do so before 1 am

71716577669550080 (2017-04-03T00:05:50.939000+00:00) : that is really expensive though
71716577669550080 (2017-04-03T00:05:13.754000+00:00) : i love the orange

71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:50:57.942000+00:00) : M when was the last
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:50:03.480000+00:00) : It can make up for however bad or good forces is
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:49:36.220000+00:00) : No you won't because sonic mania will be out and is good
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:49:16.051000+00:00) : It's funny how pvz is a team based shooter now
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:48:37.891000+00:00) : In dk they are getting blown up by fruit, in yl they are just talking about the main objective of the game
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:48:04.865000+00:00) : Yeah they should
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:47:58.340000+00:00) : It's not even good filler
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:47:51.862000+00:00) : The last part of the song
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:47:22.220000+00:00) : And the paigies part was clearly just filler
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:47:09.901000+00:00) : And the chorus is bad
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:47:01.720000+00:00) : Yes
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:44:26.376000+00:00) : And its the chorus youre allowed to repeat that
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:44:09.639000+00:00) : Which makes sense
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:42:32.884000+00:00) : All they can think about is the butter on their head
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:42:20.656000+00:00) : That's what a real zombie would say
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:42:11.851000+00:00) : That's why they are good lyrics
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:42:05.375000+00:00) : Zombies aren't smart people
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:41:49.744000+00:00) : There's butter on my head
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:41:14.132000+00:00) : Nthe lyrics that the zombies sing are amazing
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:40:20.623000+00:00) : I just like how the main chorus is there's a zombie on your long and then they show 50 partying there
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:38:38.136000+00:00) : It has better lyrics
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:38:03.333000+00:00) : How is that worse
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:37:37.430000+00:00) : I just hink they could've done better but the rap literally doesn't do anything positive or negative to my impression of the game
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:37:10.232000+00:00) : Also it's not like I care
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:36:35.779000+00:00) : Ik it's a bad parody
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:36:10.837000+00:00) : They do t even say begin to say walnuts a third time
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:35:57.522000+00:00) : No that's twice
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:33:41.674000+00:00) : Trash
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:33:26.950000+00:00) : Paigies in cagies was 5 times, walnuts peanuts pineapple shells was 2
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:29:56.851000+00:00) : Yl rap is just trash there's no good lyrics
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:29:23.279000+00:00) : That's just the chorus
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:28:34.325000+00:00) : Yl rap had to repeat so many things because it's only two characters vs 5
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:28:11.702000+00:00) : That's the only line they repeat
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:23:53.590000+00:00) : The pagies in cages, who'll set them free? x10
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:22:07.491000+00:00) : They can be more creative
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:21:59.133000+00:00) : Yeah i can
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:17:18.955000+00:00) : I realize they both aren't designed to be masterpieces but the lyrics of dk rap are better and aren't repeated 10 tomes each like in yl rap
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:16:17.190000+00:00) : But the dk rap was actually good
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:14:21.140000+00:00) : I saw but it's not good
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:10:08.891000+00:00) : It has so many battle modes
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:10:01.566000+00:00) : That game will be the best Mario kart
71716577669550080 (2017-04-02T16:09:46.257000+00:00) : Yeah

71716577669550080 (2017-03-30T00:56:59.384000+00:00) : sounds like we need to take the history of video games course
71716577669550080 (2017-03-30T00:56:04.498000+00:00) : it does when its a direct continuation of the story
71716577669550080 (2017-03-30T00:55:47.929000+00:00) : but episode 2 was 2007
71716577669550080 (2017-03-30T00:55:21.845000+00:00) : it looks like it
71716577669550080 (2017-03-30T00:52:58.696000+00:00) : 20 years from now im sitll going to assume every kid plays minecraft and i'll still be right
71716577669550080 (2017-03-30T00:52:27.495000+00:00) : oh is that what they all play now
71716577669550080 (2017-03-30T00:51:47.286000+00:00) : children wont ever have to until they make a minecraft 2
71716577669550080 (2017-03-30T00:50:57.844000+00:00) : or maybe 2.8 is just a bigger remaster of 2 hence why we got +0.8 instead of +0.5
71716577669550080 (2017-03-30T00:50:18.934000+00:00) : that would make sense based on the 1.5 thing
71716577669550080 (2017-03-30T00:50:05.334000+00:00) : i thought 2.8 was a remaster of 2.5 but i could be wrong

71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T17:16:43.347000+00:00) : now wouldnt that be an adventure
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T17:16:07.014000+00:00) : guys what if we went to TI http://blog.dota2.com/2017/03/tickets-for-the-international-2017/
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:37:34.849000+00:00) : for some reason i always underestimate those teams probably because i havent been following the chinese scene very closely anymore
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:36:50.771000+00:00) : the chinese teams are doing surprisingly well at DAC
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:34:19.448000+00:00) : <@!125452744440938497> dota?
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:26:25.786000+00:00) : and then miyamoto just grew up on gardening and furniture rearrangement
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:24:43.537000+00:00) : they could do that but doesnt kojima own some of the rights
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:22:23.356000+00:00) : theres not even any story to self destruct
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:21:32.296000+00:00) : kind of sucks that the ending of such a critically acclaimed franchise has to go out like that
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:20:38.424000+00:00) : like he didnt want konami to make another mgs game
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:20:13.966000+00:00) : i just heard he purposely messed it up because he was leaving or something
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:18:20.535000+00:00) : i want that game just because of the art style
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:18:02.679000+00:00) : i also want octopath traveler information
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:17:17.270000+00:00) : because that game looks awesome
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:17:13.082000+00:00) : or just confirmation that it will be in english
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:17:02.656000+00:00) : i want dq11 soon
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:16:16.806000+00:00) : since it wont come out for another 2 years
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:16:10.221000+00:00) : its probably best if you forget about it
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:16:01.996000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:15:25.139000+00:00) : who loved snakes
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:15:19.979000+00:00) : this is irrelevant but i like how snake pass was developed by a biology teacher
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:09:06.860000+00:00) : but nier also does this cool thing where they change the gameplay all the time throughout the game
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:08:52.719000+00:00) : i dont dont think nier is musou either from the game play ive seen
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:05:42.490000+00:00) : i can only think of bloodborne and darksouls right now but i know those games only have the gameplay in common not the universe
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:04:46.852000+00:00) : nier is like a spin off of the main drakengard series according to wikipedia and ashers lore here
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:04:10.910000+00:00) : ah i see its like the same series overall though
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:02:45.947000+00:00) : what relation do those games have to each other besides that though
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:02:36.167000+00:00) : asher the composer for drakengard and neir is the same
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T02:01:03.623000+00:00) : it will be a be a while before this is out anyway
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:59:23.255000+00:00) : although its good to see a reviewer rate the game for what it is. ive noticed a lot of reviewers give even the best indie games 8/10s just because they need to reserve the higher scores for AAA titles for some reason
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:57:52.371000+00:00) : bold claim for an indie title
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:57:47.242000+00:00) : this guy calls it the best game so far this year
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:55:32.441000+00:00) : just on pc
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:55:30.620000+00:00) : not for console
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:55:05.643000+00:00) : https://www.destructoid.com/review-hollow-knight-427608.phtml
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:53:00.956000+00:00) : its not a menu its an exploratory hub
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:52:52.210000+00:00) : you know what i mean
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:52:07.458000+00:00) : galaxy just gives you a level select screen
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:52:01.363000+00:00) : but it still has the aspect where you have to find the levels
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:51:19.058000+00:00) : and there are like 3 places you can go to do very specific things
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:51:05.774000+00:00) : but in galaxy its small
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:51:00.120000+00:00) : also you can run around free in both the hub worlds of sm64 and sunshine
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:50:39.604000+00:00) : thats true but that dynamic causes it to be a lot different in feel than sunshine
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:48:42.083000+00:00) : but it fits closer with them than sm64 and sunshine
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:47:50.095000+00:00) : so they arent sequels but they are two distinct categories of 3d marios
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:47:35.632000+00:00) : i agree with that
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:45:02.992000+00:00) : like compare how the camera works in 64 and sunshine to how it works in galaxy and 3d world
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:44:33.350000+00:00) : and also bring up good points about how the camera is a lot different between the games
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:44:21.596000+00:00) : they describe a lot this
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:43:59.661000+00:00) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIIlrDQTDxw
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:42:39.614000+00:00) : i think whoever made that was miyamoto
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:41:28.553000+00:00) : not integrated into one big one
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:41:21.673000+00:00) : yeah but thats like a separate level
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:40:54.791000+00:00) : no in 64 you can race and shit
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:40:42.771000+00:00) : in galaxy the only things like that are on the hub planet
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:40:26.145000+00:00) : i think the main thing about 64 and sunshine is that there are npcs in the areas that you can interact with and things to do besides the main goal of getting the star
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:39:04.397000+00:00) : maybe im not describing it correctly but you must see the difference
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:38:39.721000+00:00) : ive played all of them
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:38:30.703000+00:00) : yes
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:38:18.573000+00:00) : whereas in sunshine theres a central hub that you access everythign from
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:38:07.526000+00:00) : but getting enough stars on one unlocks the next and so on
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:37:26.606000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:37:07.014000+00:00) : <@!125452744440938497> i can maybe in a couple hours when i finish grading
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:36:54.388000+00:00) : where in galaxy you just progress through the galaxy and get a star on each planet
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:36:36.217000+00:00) : like theres multiple main objectives in each area
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:36:21.263000+00:00) : but 64 and sunshine share the same core gameplay in that they are open world and there arent traditional levels
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:35:40.940000+00:00) : but one is linear and one is not
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:35:36.564000+00:00) : same as in 3d platformer
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:35:30.277000+00:00) : not the same gameplay
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:35:23.522000+00:00) : no mario has completely different movesets
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:34:36.463000+00:00) : no its not continuity based its gameplay based
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:34:13.368000+00:00) : but people have been waiting 15 for sunshine sequel
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:34:05.168000+00:00) : the last hf came out in 2007 people have only been waiting 10 years
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:33:18.819000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:33:10.255000+00:00) : checkmate

71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:33:02.562000+00:00) : that two very different series right there
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:32:47.555000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:32:08.336000+00:00) : they released an official mario sequel chart
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:31:55.338000+00:00) : but it's a sequel ok
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:31:31.146000+00:00) : they dont even take place on the same planet
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:31:24.022000+00:00) : im pretty sure galaxy and sm64 are comp[letely different games
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:30:52.236000+00:00) : thats like calling age of empires 2 hd a sequel to age of empires 2
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:30:17.804000+00:00) : thats not a sequel
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:30:05.593000+00:00) : thats not the same
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:30:00.071000+00:00) : wats ds
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:29:55.912000+00:00) : still earlier than hf
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:29:24.015000+00:00) : half life was like 2007 or some shit
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:29:15.501000+00:00) : mario 64 hasnt gotten a sequal since 1996
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:27:51.666000+00:00) : nintendo could announce half life 3 switch exclusive for holiday 2017 and still no one would give a shit about anything but mario
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:27:06.219000+00:00) : true but i also think at that time no one will give a shit abotu anything except mario
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:25:58.214000+00:00) : yeah im sure thats going to be their system seller in the holidays...
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:25:04.252000+00:00) : they really should be marketing a lot more for their first actually switch exclusive AAA game
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:24:42.186000+00:00) : because based on that it lacks content
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:24:31.111000+00:00) : people arent going to buy that game based on the 5 minute demo
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:24:22.189000+00:00) : which is my point
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:24:11.739000+00:00) : more than 5 is all we know
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:23:33.739000+00:00) : in the 1 minute 1v1 demo
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:23:25.663000+00:00) : "indepth gameplay" of the same 3 stages and 5 characters
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:22:24.578000+00:00) : and it's spring
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:22:19.129000+00:00) : that shit is releasing in spring and we know nothing about it
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:22:11.457000+00:00) : even if they dont do a direct
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:22:07.767000+00:00) : they really do need a new Arms trailer though
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:21:25.185000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:20:30.778000+00:00) : the switch announcment was literally the night before
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:20:19.754000+00:00) : like the pokemon ones were sometimes the day before
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:20:09.211000+00:00) : but yeah its weird that a big one like this wouldnt be announced
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:20:01.218000+00:00) : i think sometimes they were kind of random
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:19:32.823000+00:00) : they announced lucas for smash 4 on april first 2015
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:18:58.345000+00:00) : according to reddit
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:18:55.679000+00:00) : yeah twice actually
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:18:20.655000+00:00) : they already announced what would be in the dlc
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:18:10.556000+00:00) :

71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:17:03.556000+00:00) : eh
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:16:33.827000+00:00) : they also showed a substantial amount of gameplay the last time they showed it
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:16:05.355000+00:00) : oh sorry Grezzo

71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:15:22.312000+00:00) : thats first party though
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:14:44.660000+00:00) : yeah keenan but nintendo rarely drop games
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:14:27.566000+00:00) : but that was also the day of wasnt it
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:14:18.587000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:14:17.429000+00:00) : and no one believed it
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:14:09.129000+00:00) : i think that disproves it
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:13:50.039000+00:00) : "Trials" is spelled wrong
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:13:39.302000+00:00) : what
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:12:13.154000+00:00) : yea
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:12:08.717000+00:00) : the person making up it probably put a lot of effort into it
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:11:51.487000+00:00) : still this leak is surprisingly detailed
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:11:20.952000+00:00) : more believable
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:11:16.147000+00:00) : that was the day of though
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:10:39.712000+00:00) : probably never
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:10:37.919000+00:00) : i dont ever know when to trust 4chan
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T01:10:31.926000+00:00) : https://boards.4chan.org/v/thread/371959439#371959439
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:25:34.297000+00:00) : probably just aleph-not like some pleb
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:24:51.798000+00:00) : there are multiple levels of infinity so i could easily make a god more powerful than even that
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:23:19.980000+00:00) : i like the concept of peaceful dragons way more than mean ones
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:21:56.263000+00:00) : i will at some point
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:21:49.015000+00:00) : which i literally never use
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:21:42.553000+00:00) : i dopped 1k on the lynel hat
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:21:33.262000+00:00) : ah
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:21:14.159000+00:00) : i might already have enough because i never use my materials
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:21:03.180000+00:00) : how much mon does that cost?
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:20:27.448000+00:00) : its a mutually beneficial scenario between little hylians and the dragons
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:20:03.496000+00:00) : its how they shed and get clean
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:19:37.714000+00:00) : im pretty sure they want you to shoot them
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:16:14.881000+00:00) : fine not broken but fastest
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:15:20.535000+00:00) : i think the most broken is snow bowling though
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:13:26.447000+00:00) : i never really pay attention to schedules or the clock
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:13:08.096000+00:00) : i was just hoping i would run into him at the right time
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:12:58.865000+00:00) : well that makes it a lot easier
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:12:20.843000+00:00) : because i know each of the three dragons have like 5 different spots they can be in, i just figured which one thery spawned in was random
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:11:38.200000+00:00) : set times of day?
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:11:19.353000+00:00) : also dont the dragons just appear in a certain area randomly
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:11:03.595000+00:00) : how much do they seel for
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:09:31.062000+00:00) : yeah but dragon is huge and always far away and his neck is never in the right place at the right time for me
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:08:50.618000+00:00) : because you have specifically shoot the neck
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:05:16.435000+00:00) : idk if you have any advice
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:04:52.042000+00:00) : and i need three to upgrade my champions shirt
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:04:37.153000+00:00) : its also hard to get a scale from faron's neck beard
71716577669550080 (2017-03-28T00:01:01.343000+00:00) : top right in akkala
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:55:34.179000+00:00) : idk if you've been there but its pretty cool
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:55:23.971000+00:00) : then they wake up and zap
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:55:19.664000+00:00) : they are all dead until you steal the treasure
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:55:01.868000+00:00) : theres this one labrynth in botw btw thats has a basement of guardians
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:54:06.346000+00:00) : especialy with luminous stones
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:54:01.483000+00:00) : i could have totally seen some kind of luminescent mushroom caves in botw
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:53:26.990000+00:00) : looking at screenshots it looks pretty cool
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:52:17.717000+00:00) : like why arent the gorons living inside of the mountain like in oot
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:51:35.873000+00:00) : like inside a mountain or something
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:51:31.790000+00:00) : i thought that would have been so cool
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:51:26.783000+00:00) : my one dissapointment with the whole environment thing is that theres no massive cave region
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:50:45.824000+00:00) : ah yeah of course
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:50:28.517000+00:00) : bones is apparently a biome too
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:49:58.601000+00:00) : these dudes came up with 12 which is impressive
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:49:48.519000+00:00) : thats about all i got
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:49:44.423000+00:00) : and your water
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:49:39.806000+00:00) : your forest
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:49:36.661000+00:00) : your desert
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:49:34.149000+00:00) : you got your snow
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:49:24.145000+00:00) : personally i can only think of like 4 biomes
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:49:17.745000+00:00) : where it would feel new each time
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:49:09.553000+00:00) : im surprised they were able to come up with that many unique environements
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:48:57.739000+00:00) : i do like thought how each of the 12 towers is in a completely different biome
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:48:34.421000+00:00) : just a little bit
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:48:06.528000+00:00) : just like minecraft
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:47:23.709000+00:00) : but then still invent new ones whenever they feel like it
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:47:14.138000+00:00) : i like how they strive to be so realistic with the animals in each environment
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:46:07.949000+00:00) : ive seen one but havent piloted one yet
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:45:47.068000+00:00) : he could always be my hm slave
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:45:32.226000+00:00) : i would surf on his back every day
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:44:52.687000+00:00) : lol im nostalgic for prince sidon
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:44:21.920000+00:00) : ok i wont get the chance to play until then anyway
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:43:41.679000+00:00) : because even with speed potions it was hard to catch up to them
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:43:24.412000+00:00) : i spent literally 20 mintues trying to catch a reindeer for a shrine quest
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:42:40.720000+00:00) : because i dont want to sneak
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:42:36.307000+00:00) : i just run at them
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:42:31.005000+00:00) : catching horses and deer and fairies is my bane
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:42:20.192000+00:00) : i usually get too impatient for stealth
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:42:14.540000+00:00) : we'll see
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:42:03.446000+00:00) : lol

71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:40:11.696000+00:00) : i took so many screenshots of his text
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:40:04.725000+00:00) : bolson is definitely my favorite character
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:39:39.220000+00:00) : which you havent done
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:39:36.468000+00:00) : and also bolson and that whole sidequest
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:39:28.394000+00:00) : i think kilton is pretty bonkers
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:38:47.517000+00:00) : they say some crazy shit
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:38:32.437000+00:00) : i think most of the npcs are pretty humorous
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:37:49.679000+00:00) : what was in the very beginning
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:35:38.763000+00:00) : also its going to be hard for any divine beast to top the elephant and prince sidon
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:34:33.901000+00:00) : because they are fucking obsessed
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:34:04.494000+00:00) : my brother told me you have to distract the yiga with bananas
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:33:33.762000+00:00) : and one perfectly rectangle settlement in the very middle
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:33:14.978000+00:00) : i just like the desert and the sandstorms and how you can see a giant camel in the distance
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:32:57.264000+00:00) : i just activated the towers
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:32:50.543000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:32:45.487000+00:00) : i havent explored the desert yet but it looks so cool from above

71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:32:23.257000+00:00) : i just got to the gerudo but havent done it yet

71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:31:25.178000+00:00) : at least 70
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:31:06.266000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:28:43.905000+00:00) : 🚗 🏠
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:28:10.843000+00:00) : heh
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:21:24.427000+00:00) : idk theres always next new years
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:19:18.483000+00:00) : splatwon
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:18:55.868000+00:00) : they actually did miss a big opprotunity with spla2on
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:18:10.925000+00:00) : they are going to fuck it up even further
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:18:06.255000+00:00) : its going to be called smash5 i just know it
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:17:45.265000+00:00) : WTF NINTENDO
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:17:34.564000+00:00) : super smash bros, super smash bros melee, super smash bros brawl, super mash bros for WII U!!
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:17:05.677000+00:00) : also WTF IS UP WITH SMASH
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:16:50.979000+00:00) : no if you're going to introduce numbers halfway through you have to go back and rename the old ones
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:16:22.673000+00:00) : WTF NINTENDO
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:16:19.795000+00:00) : Theres mario karty 7 and 8 but no 1 2 3 4 5 6
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:16:11.035000+00:00) : it really bothers me that the mario kart series suddenly started using numbers for 3ds
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:14:15.638000+00:00) : you probably just shouldnt ever use numbers so it's easier to make spinoffs
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:13:44.487000+00:00) : but you have to keep it consistent
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:13:39.831000+00:00) : either you dont use numbers or you do
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:12:38.881000+00:00) : "battlefield one" smh
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:12:23.629000+00:00) : none of these fuckers seem to be able to do it
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:12:14.469000+00:00) : if i became a video game dev the first thing i would do is get numbering right
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:11:42.430000+00:00) : you just have to go for it
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:11:39.645000+00:00) : sure but the laws of video game series ignore what you can and cant do story wise
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:10:28.641000+00:00) : thats what im saying man, they should have ignored the fact that it was a trilogy and stuck with the numbering scheme and call it mass effect 4. then it would have been good
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:05:28.445000+00:00) : usually when games are numbered and then suddenly stop being numbered, thats a bad sign
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:04:38.110000+00:00) : thats just the final product
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:04:35.025000+00:00) : but nope
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:04:33.206000+00:00) : i like how at first, when the early demo came out, people were like "these animations have to be in beta, and they'll definitely bea  day one patch for the final release"
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:03:31.208000+00:00) : especialyl when compared to past mass effect games
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:03:16.743000+00:00) : people are focused on the bad animation but apparently the script is trash as well
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:02:12.692000+00:00) : its like no mans sky but at least you can claim nms wasnt AAA even if it was still 60 dollars
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:01:39.269000+00:00) : for a AAA game in 2017, adromeda is kind of unacceptable
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:01:28.294000+00:00) : but he kind of has a point
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:01:15.953000+00:00) : it's a lot more brutal than most reviewers
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T23:00:52.094000+00:00) : i watched the dunkey video. i thought it was pretty exaggerated but still funny
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:53:20.360000+00:00) : like in how much they are working with indie developers now
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:53:09.444000+00:00) : yeah their nindies presentation last month was evident of that
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:52:18.383000+00:00) : and those arent indie games but its true nintendo did publish those
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:51:59.472000+00:00) : it makes sense i just havent seen it happen
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:51:02.956000+00:00) : for some games they only publish though
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:50:53.583000+00:00) : well they do both
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:49:41.726000+00:00) : nicalis is the publisher
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:46:39.104000+00:00) : like snipperclips isnt even physical and thats as close to nintendo as you can get
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:46:19.737000+00:00) : nintendo does marketing and shit but i dont know if theyve ever helped something get a physical release
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:45:59.784000+00:00) : i dont know any indie physical releases that have outsourced to nintendo
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:44:34.102000+00:00) : but still it's their first physical release game
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:44:28.665000+00:00) : maybe nicalis is well enough off
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:44:08.361000+00:00) : i dont know what binding of isaac did
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:43:45.835000+00:00) : because nintendo isnt helping them there
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:43:38.730000+00:00) : and in the case of Rime which does have a physical release, they had to make it more expensive
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:42:59.209000+00:00) : unless nintendo is subsidizing some of it
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:42:50.520000+00:00) : nah most indie games dont have physical releases at all
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:41:04.895000+00:00) : but definitely other third parties could
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:40:58.570000+00:00) : im pretty sure nintendo wont
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:40:51.452000+00:00) : hopefully more ccompanies wont start doing this
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:40:32.336000+00:00) : i know and i dont like them for it
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:40:02.275000+00:00) : sure but i think thats one of the major draws of a cartridge system in the first place, is that they are fast enough to run the game directly off of instead of having to install it first like with discs
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:38:41.596000+00:00) : they are completely defeating the point of a physical game
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:37:32.391000+00:00) : switch cartridge sizes are more than enough space for it
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:37:03.230000+00:00) : but the game should be all on the cartridge
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T21:36:21.818000+00:00) : this is unacceptable http://nintendoeverything.com/lego-city-undercovers-packaging-mentions-needing-up-to-13gb-of-space-for-game-download-on-switch/
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T20:45:53.035000+00:00) : keenan did you ever beat nioh
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T19:59:43.150000+00:00) : its like me with pokemon in high school
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T19:59:24.451000+00:00) : this kid in my class literally is playing botw on his switch every day
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T19:03:55.249000+00:00) : the dudes a legend
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T19:03:49.637000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T19:02:11.274000+00:00) : so Edmund McMillen made two games that were directly inspired by nes classics
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T18:52:10.289000+00:00) : isnt that game getting a sequel
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T18:50:45.535000+00:00) : da fuck
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T18:50:42.853000+00:00) : and theres even a captured princess too
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T18:50:36.257000+00:00) : I literally just realized
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T18:50:17.106000+00:00) : this completely changes how I view the game
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T18:50:08.359000+00:00) : the abbreviation for Super Meat Boy SMB is the same as for Super Mario Brothers
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T18:49:32.495000+00:00) : i just had a realization
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T18:49:26.892000+00:00) : woah
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T18:48:13.114000+00:00) : ok
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T18:43:57.693000+00:00) : Thanks is better than speed running
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T18:43:49.374000+00:00) : http://gonintendo.com/stories/276872-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-yet-another-paraglider-distance-recor
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T14:12:29.811000+00:00) : Apparently Platinum isn't the best at PC ports
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T14:12:19.153000+00:00) : If they ever will
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T14:12:11.682000+00:00) : I'm waiting until they fix the PC version before I get it because of these problems
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T14:08:37.323000+00:00) : Lol I read some user reviews where people were complaining that the first 30 minutes were too hard because you can't save and if you die you start over
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T03:21:18.574000+00:00) : probably took all the farm away from his team
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T01:46:00.273000+00:00) : sure
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T01:45:55.072000+00:00) : but DAAACC
71716577669550080 (2017-03-27T01:34:10.061000+00:00) : hyrule has never looked so beautiful

71716577669550080 (2017-03-16T03:22:43.323000+00:00) : And also tp scrolls have a  longer cd so it's harder for people to rotate and def towers
71716577669550080 (2017-03-16T03:22:10.361000+00:00) : So it's easier to push alone
71716577669550080 (2017-03-16T03:21:49.489000+00:00) : No it's +2 armor per enemy hero around a tower
71716577669550080 (2017-03-16T01:31:40.498000+00:00) : No but I think he was indirectly buffed by the split pushing buffs

71716577669550080 (2017-03-04T17:49:24.695000+00:00) : It's also cool how they make you trade off between stamina and health
71716577669550080 (2017-03-04T17:48:24.961000+00:00) : That and the upgrades

71716577669550080 (2017-03-04T17:40:13.593000+00:00) : Although links jump is a little too realistic. As soon they add jumping in a Zelda game i keep expecting it to be more like mario

71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T01:08:20.123000+00:00) : basically like humble monthly bundle but not limited to 6-8 games each month
71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T01:08:03.116000+00:00) : i want steam mainly

71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T01:07:14.874000+00:00) : and it's at a really good price point too
71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T01:07:07.697000+00:00) : well aside from your isolated experience, ps now only does streaming. so it's really cool to finally see a subscription game service that lets you download  full games
71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T01:04:58.444000+00:00) : it could have been just a ps+ thing
71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T01:03:51.985000+00:00) : and i can guarantee you that my pc is not running a full ps3 emulator via ps now
71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T01:03:37.625000+00:00) : alright but not my pc
71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T01:03:15.421000+00:00) : and pretty superior to anything else out right now
71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T01:03:09.091000+00:00) : whatever keenan the point is that it's cool
71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T01:02:52.228000+00:00) : for my windows 10 pc
71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T01:02:47.255000+00:00) : which is requesting that i enroll in a free trial
71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T01:02:36.823000+00:00) : not according to their website
71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T01:01:52.340000+00:00) : the fact that ps now supports devices other than the ps4 is evidence of streaming only
71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T01:00:54.379000+00:00) : at least not with ps now

71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T00:59:35.578000+00:00) : everywhere mentions it as a streaming service
71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T00:57:09.666000+00:00) : keenan im pretty sure its onlyt streamin
71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T00:55:03.271000+00:00) : they will still be adding more games im sure

71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T00:52:46.294000+00:00) : streaming makes a huge difference
71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T00:52:38.811000+00:00) : this xbox thing is full downloads
71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T00:52:32.499000+00:00) : its also streamed
71716577669550080 (2017-03-01T00:51:59.960000+00:00) : but its also twice as expensive and only ps3 games

71716577669550080 (2017-02-27T20:40:35.256000+00:00) : so even if you cant get a console you can buy some joycons or zelda and get the poster

71716577669550080 (2017-02-25T00:33:43.040000+00:00) : Poor tomorrow corp trying to make the switch launch:
“We hope we can make it! We're still just 3 people, trying to launch 3 games on March 3rd — and it's going to be close. For reference, the Zelda team has approximately 2.9 billion people and a really fast horse, but we're close behind. Save some champagne for us, Nintendo, we're going to be bloody and tired and maybe not all 3 of us will make it alive, but we're going to get there, and the games will be stunning!”

71716577669550080 (2017-02-22T00:18:35.950000+00:00) : Smiley faces are how you make yourself seem more human

71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:38:56.613000+00:00) : just to fuck with them
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:38:48.930000+00:00) : even though they submit identical work
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:38:40.429000+00:00) : for lab assignments he might give one partner a 99.99 and the other a 99.98
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:38:03.034000+00:00) : lol the professor i have likes messing with people by making their grades 99.99/100

71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:23:22.868000+00:00) : idk i like the first one because of his eyes
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:22:39.636000+00:00) : i like the kk one because its something that someone who plays the game would recognize, but someone who doesnt would just think it's a normal dog sticker
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:21:17.772000+00:00) : the second one still looks like him but it coudl also easily look like a some miner dude with a hammer
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:20:48.479000+00:00) : maybe the first one since it's more recognizeable as dedede
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:20:29.797000+00:00) : i cant decide
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:19:41.290000+00:00) : fuck
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:15:40.245000+00:00) : i thought that was just the bad guys
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:15:35.571000+00:00) : does snake actually ever do !
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:15:22.928000+00:00) : that one is pretty cool
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:11:49.530000+00:00) : or maybe its just that face on the sticker
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:11:19.092000+00:00) : i think seeing him in the game like that would also bother me
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:10:53.665000+00:00) : mentally
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:10:51.068000+00:00) : like it bothers me
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:10:45.197000+00:00) : for some reason i find that really unappealing
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:08:17.622000+00:00) : or get those stickers that you can move
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:07:51.087000+00:00) : i need to figure out where to put stickers
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:06:52.252000+00:00) : did the mega man stickers inspire you
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:06:22.567000+00:00) : and cheat in your drawings
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:06:17.133000+00:00) : then you can trace them
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:05:57.757000+00:00) : but yeah thats basically furniture
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:05:51.612000+00:00) : or on the back
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:05:49.108000+00:00) : like behind where you put the paper
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T02:01:34.882000+00:00) : furniture
71716577669550080 (2017-02-21T00:45:52.453000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T23:05:52.546000+00:00) : ok
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T23:04:53.835000+00:00) : anyway i was just considering post game as optional content beyond the main story, similar to side quests. not a continuation of the main story with a narrative shift
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T23:04:06.216000+00:00) : alright it doesnt matter what exactly happens in metal gear it was just another example
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T23:03:39.962000+00:00) : that happened in luke cage and daredevil
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T23:03:22.399000+00:00) : im just giving another example of a common narrative shift
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T23:02:59.475000+00:00) : im not talking about broken steel
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T23:02:29.933000+00:00) : yeah it's like when you spend half the game fighting one bad guy and then half way through you switch to a new badder bad guy
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T23:01:34.954000+00:00) : but ultimately you just group it all together as one campaign
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T23:01:23.195000+00:00) : most games dont do a lot of weird things metal gear does
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T23:00:53.292000+00:00) : just say its a long campaign
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T23:00:46.436000+00:00) : then whyd you say it was so amazing to have so much post game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T23:00:33.640000+00:00) : thats like not even optional content
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T23:00:25.062000+00:00) : thats barely post game then
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T22:58:57.400000+00:00) : you mean 45 hours campaign plus 35 post game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T22:58:33.260000+00:00) : nah i think what i said is very reasonable
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T22:57:44.429000+00:00) : you are way too defensive about metal gear
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T22:57:03.913000+00:00) : post game is very similr to side quests
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T22:56:00.851000+00:00) : when you count side quests and post game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T22:55:51.027000+00:00) : average open world content length is much longer
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T22:55:44.809000+00:00) : which is mgsv
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T22:55:36.136000+00:00) : no i think average open world campaign lenght is around 40 hours
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T22:53:55.498000+00:00) : xenoblade
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T22:53:26.278000+00:00) : well maybe where mgsv has 40hrs of campaign, and 40 hours of post game, other games just have 80 hrs of campaign
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T22:51:50.776000+00:00) : maybe not when that content happens in regards to the overall story
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T22:51:15.074000+00:00) : the amount of content is normal
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T22:49:32.813000+00:00) : *normal open world game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T22:49:17.264000+00:00) : wow it's almost like it's a normal game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-20T22:35:20.580000+00:00) : Look at the future guys https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/switch-cart-2.jpg

71716577669550080 (2017-02-19T22:46:15.324000+00:00) : although i doubt those games are actually e10
71716577669550080 (2017-02-19T22:45:36.733000+00:00) : im pretty sure ESRB cant actually play through the whole game, so the devs just tell them key points and they tactfully leave out the part about the penis
71716577669550080 (2017-02-19T22:35:12.951000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-02-19T22:35:10.370000+00:00) :

71716577669550080 (2017-02-16T20:33:42.341000+00:00) : but i think they are slowly being replaced by chromebooks
71716577669550080 (2017-02-16T20:33:28.825000+00:00) : lenovo already is really high in terms of licensing their products to big companies and schools
71716577669550080 (2017-02-16T20:30:25.293000+00:00) : i dont think they are marked up a ton
71716577669550080 (2017-02-16T20:30:15.474000+00:00) : similar to the nexus line
71716577669550080 (2017-02-16T20:30:10.116000+00:00) : the motorola phones have always been really good for the price
71716577669550080 (2017-02-16T20:29:46.576000+00:00) : well im sure apple and samsung have huge premiums

71716577669550080 (2017-02-16T20:17:49.723000+00:00) :

71716577669550080 (2017-02-16T01:31:57.406000+00:00) : its weird
71716577669550080 (2017-02-16T01:31:07.398000+00:00) : why
71716577669550080 (2017-02-16T01:30:29.864000+00:00) : wtf ultra street fighter 2 has a first person mode

71716577669550080 (2017-02-16T01:11:16.879000+00:00) : This complexity vs onyx game is megas vs megas right now
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:48:15.687000+00:00) : i can see why you might think that
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:46:47.810000+00:00) : no but i know what it's like
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:46:24.992000+00:00) : huh
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:45:00.036000+00:00) : i think that can only be on purpose
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:44:39.370000+00:00) : so solutions are public?
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:38:50.167000+00:00) : fallout does have really good setting
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:38:44.090000+00:00) : yeah i noticed that
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:37:47.906000+00:00) : i thought fallout was one of your favorite series though
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:34:06.440000+00:00) : i was playing the witness and that game has very little polish
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:33:40.839000+00:00) : and polish
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:33:34.856000+00:00) : i realized yesterday i care a lot about minor details
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:33:19.130000+00:00) : better than bethesda?
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:33:12.448000+00:00) : whats the level of polish like
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:32:01.387000+00:00) : its also really hard for me to say why fallout or skyrim didnt keep my attention
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:30:59.655000+00:00) : do you think mgsv would hold my attention more than fallout new vegas or skyrim
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:28:31.202000+00:00) : so ronald would like it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:27:00.811000+00:00) : it just seems like an easy comparison
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:25:33.913000+00:00) : fallout 4 isnt even the best fallout game from what ive heard
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:23:05.699000+00:00) : is that relative to each other or absolute
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:12:52.134000+00:00) : it only has about a 1-couch radius
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:12:37.540000+00:00) : which is why the wii u gamepad didnt suffice
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:12:17.939000+00:00) : sometimes i have to switch couches
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:12:12.141000+00:00) : and i keep doing that
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:12:06.565000+00:00) : just like my dog
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:12:02.055000+00:00) : i just pick a spot for 30 minutes then i switch to a new spot
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:08:28.687000+00:00) : you should see how i do homework
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:08:00.081000+00:00) : but in like 100 different positions
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:07:56.005000+00:00) : most of the time i play my 3ds it's just at my house
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:07:45.228000+00:00) : i just like portable consoles because im not capable of sitting in the same spot on a couch for more than 2 hours
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:05:49.226000+00:00) : also the switch is barely bigger than the 3ds xl
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:05:02.691000+00:00) : i dont think portable is your thing aside from playing games at work
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:04:06.159000+00:00) : k
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:03:35.939000+00:00) : why
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:02:58.287000+00:00) : well also by december there will be a pretty big jrpg library on swithc
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:00:57.813000+00:00) : the ps vita is a real good emulation machine though
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T23:00:06.422000+00:00) : you barely paly any of the jrpgs available for 3ds
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T22:59:49.167000+00:00) : you have a 3ds
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T22:59:01.720000+00:00) : its just indies that you can get on pc or jrpgs that you can get on ps4
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T22:47:24.450000+00:00) : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetFront
71716577669550080 (2017-02-15T22:47:13.298000+00:00) : Most things do work on the 3ds/Wii u browser though since they are built on netfront which is a variation of webkit

71716577669550080 (2017-02-14T21:45:23.480000+00:00) : thats my first line of defense
71716577669550080 (2017-02-14T21:45:19.965000+00:00) : i thought everyone did that
71716577669550080 (2017-02-14T20:35:56.004000+00:00) : i accidentally just spent 14 minutes listening to the nioh loading screen theme
71716577669550080 (2017-02-14T19:45:35.112000+00:00) : but people didnt expect monkey king support
71716577669550080 (2017-02-14T19:45:22.913000+00:00) : a couple days ago they voted to ban all supports
71716577669550080 (2017-02-14T19:45:07.722000+00:00) : he was picked in another game as a support and he owned that one too
71716577669550080 (2017-02-14T19:34:47.882000+00:00) : for valentines day, people voted to ban all the female heroes
71716577669550080 (2017-02-14T19:34:27.249000+00:00) : so by game 3 in a best of three, there are like 40 heroes remaining and they are usually shitty ones
71716577669550080 (2017-02-14T19:33:58.281000+00:00) : the community hero votes on 10 heros to ban each day, and after each game in a series, the heroes that were picked or banned are also banned for the next game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-14T19:33:22.872000+00:00) : elimination mode
71716577669550080 (2017-02-14T19:29:47.421000+00:00) : on the same team

71716577669550080 (2017-02-14T15:27:27.576000+00:00) : this is a cool poster

71716577669550080 (2017-02-14T02:10:14.144000+00:00) : if you have a working one of those
71716577669550080 (2017-02-14T02:10:08.762000+00:00) : although im pretty sure this game could run on a potato
71716577669550080 (2017-02-14T02:09:19.543000+00:00) : cool
71716577669550080 (2017-02-14T01:41:43.458000+00:00) : direct download: https://dl.humble.com/numbernone/The_Witness_Installer_v964.zip?gamekey=6v3zBnNwrs8Xn2hE&ttl=1487122882&t=3c8e3afdee171acaa1a5483b82fd843b
71716577669550080 (2017-02-14T01:41:04.454000+00:00) : i can give you link
71716577669550080 (2017-02-14T01:40:58.350000+00:00) : no its drm free
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T23:24:57.380000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T23:24:42.255000+00:00) : there is no precedent for major updates though
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T23:24:35.270000+00:00) : yeah those were bug fix updates
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T23:23:38.509000+00:00) : also when pc gets multiplayer i dont know if it will be cross platform
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T23:22:42.148000+00:00) : the dev only develops for pc, and other people port to the consoles for him
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T23:22:21.368000+00:00) : but the updates come out a lot slower since it's just one dev
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T23:22:14.707000+00:00) : and pc will probaly get those updates first
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T23:22:06.089000+00:00) : but it gets continuous updates just like minecraft
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T23:21:56.762000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T23:20:03.979000+00:00) : he likes those city sims where you just build stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T23:18:49.308000+00:00) : thats actually really useful
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T23:18:43.697000+00:00) : damn this bundle comes with an R textbook
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T23:17:56.550000+00:00) : he likes similar games
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:51:57.647000+00:00) : And an emphasis over that economy rather than an emphasis on building
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:49:06.919000+00:00) : Ronald would probably like Stanley parable though
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:48:18.588000+00:00) : Stardew is 2d and the opposite of hyper violent
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:47:22.596000+00:00) : It's not mine either but I still own it lol
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:46:39.197000+00:00) : I'm just excited to try the ones i haven't heard of before
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:45:50.044000+00:00) : Super meat boy and world of goo for example are games everyone should own
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:45:29.214000+00:00) : Also these aren't "random" games
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:45:20.074000+00:00) : But the DRM free version will just be like a zip file
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:45:09.760000+00:00) : It is
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:44:59.484000+00:00) : Past humble bundles
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:42:43.632000+00:00) : So I can give the copy to someone
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:42:34.600000+00:00) : I already have it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:42:22.436000+00:00) : I have no clue why the witness is DRM free. That's a 40 dollar game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:42:00.487000+00:00) : Yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:41:22.913000+00:00) : I'd give it to you for free but Keenan already asked for it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:41:07.806000+00:00) : Lol I was just saying the only games I really want from this are the witness, sproggiwood, rockets, and Subnautica
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:38:49.038000+00:00) : I have more than 5
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:38:14.802000+00:00) : If you played similar mobile games
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:38:08.064000+00:00) : Day of the tentacle is a really high rated point and click game from the 90s that you might like
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:36:32.796000+00:00) : A lot of these games are really good or well knwon
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:35:52.795000+00:00) : Same with VvVVvv and super hexagon
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:35:34.034000+00:00) : World of goo, super meat boy, and Stanley parable are like 5 bucks each but also classics
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:34:34.246000+00:00) : And stardew is 15
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:34:29.888000+00:00) : Considering the witness itself is 40 bucks
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:31:34.713000+00:00) : English confirmed.
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T22:31:07.710000+00:00) : No it's a min of 30 this time because it's 4 times the size of a normal bundle and for a special occasion
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T21:52:19.838000+00:00) : The games are either steam keys, DRM free downloads, or both
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T21:48:42.972000+00:00) : So essentially all the developers/authors of the games and books in this bundle are donating them
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T21:47:54.192000+00:00) : But this one is an especially big bundle that all goes to charity
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T21:47:35.666000+00:00) : Usually you can choose what you want to pay from 1 dollar and beyond and then how the money is distributed amongst charity and the drvelopers
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T21:46:25.479000+00:00) : You just buy it and get the games
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T21:01:05.076000+00:00) : I'll peer review your essay
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:59:40.458000+00:00) : I feel like I'm just a lot looser than you in terms of genres. I'm about in the middle on a scale from "Keenan" to "everything is literally Skyrim"
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:55:45.848000+00:00) : When are you going to write your dissertation on video game genres
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:54:35.232000+00:00) : Also you might be able to upgrade your hair in shantae i just haven't gotten there yet
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:52:45.952000+00:00) : ori also has one directional attacks and its a metroidvania
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:51:32.275000+00:00) : shantae is more similar to a metroidvania than to a platformer like shovel knight
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:51:16.158000+00:00) : i dont think it's hurting anything to classify other similar games in it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:50:26.526000+00:00) : thats an awfully small category then
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:49:44.727000+00:00) : they cant just be clones
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:49:30.899000+00:00) : not every metrooidvania is going to be exactly like metroid or castlevania
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:49:09.365000+00:00) : i think it's pedantic and ultimately doesnt matter because the games have similar gameplay
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:48:24.824000+00:00) : but that small distinction is the only thing that prevents you from saying it's a metroidvania
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:47:51.976000+00:00) : they could have easily combined all the levels into one continuous thing
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:46:05.442000+00:00) : you have to backtrack all the time after you get new abilities
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:45:19.657000+00:00) : it does
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:45:00.373000+00:00) : that is what shantae is
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:44:14.719000+00:00) : i dont see how you think shantae isnt
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:43:18.509000+00:00) : but shantae is not like shovel knight at all
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:43:10.040000+00:00) : yes
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:42:59.191000+00:00) : it has all hte same qualities
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:42:29.801000+00:00) : it literally is
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:42:09.871000+00:00) : but they are still metroidvanias
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:42:04.790000+00:00) : in the other games i mentioned you can only attack forward though
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:41:43.139000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:41:34.420000+00:00) : or ori
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:41:14.712000+00:00) : like shantae
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:41:09.142000+00:00) : one direction
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:40:44.209000+00:00) : you can attack in all four directions
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:40:36.220000+00:00) : its very smooth
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:40:32.246000+00:00) : i really like the combat
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:40:08.670000+00:00) : i agree i dont think it's trying to be darksouls i just thought it reminded me of that
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:39:06.740000+00:00) : it's kind of a depressing game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:38:49.972000+00:00) : it's pretty cool
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:38:47.202000+00:00) : hallow knight is no different either
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:38:34.489000+00:00) : they seem that way
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:36:49.879000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:36:15.309000+00:00) : i just think the themes in the game remind me a lot of darksouls
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:35:51.014000+00:00) : not because it's difficult
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:35:42.729000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:35:26.987000+00:00) : i think that game is the dark souls of metroidvanias
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:34:57.345000+00:00) : that you can run on windows
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:34:49.196000+00:00) : it's just a zip file
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:34:44.932000+00:00) : also keenan do you want me to send you the hallow knight demo?
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:33:52.539000+00:00) : but of some of it i just dont understand
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:33:42.480000+00:00) : some of it is good own its own
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:33:28.511000+00:00) : or banjo kazooie
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:33:18.281000+00:00) : i want to play doom only so i can appreciate its ost
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:32:57.665000+00:00) : i do find that in other osts though
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:32:45.552000+00:00) : but it's not like it's bad on its own
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:32:35.594000+00:00) : it ofc means more after you've played it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:32:19.468000+00:00) : gerudo valley is legendary
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:32:14.170000+00:00) : so i think you're wrong
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:32:10.217000+00:00) : also my dad occasionally watches me play zelda and he really likes the gerudo valley music even though he has no idea what it mean
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:30:55.650000+00:00) : that way you can actually see if it's good on its own
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:30:47.194000+00:00) : before and after
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:30:41.171000+00:00) : theres nothing wrong with doing both
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:29:33.440000+00:00) : instead they just kill the dudes and then the music would go away
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:29:06.884000+00:00) : even during boss themes
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:29:03.009000+00:00) : but no one ever does
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:28:59.711000+00:00) : like when you open the menu you can hear the music without the battle sounds
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:28:33.709000+00:00) : in all the gameplay footage of botw ive seen, i always get pissed that while fighting enemies they never pause to listen to the battle music without sound effects
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:27:09.082000+00:00) : i can actually see myself spending considerable time studying the textures on some rocks
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:26:38.541000+00:00) : fair point
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:25:04.011000+00:00) : they have hero mode for that
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:24:58.939000+00:00) : zelda is not one of the series i try to make harder on myself
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:24:11.631000+00:00) : you arent better you are just not as deliberate
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:23:16.945000+00:00) : you also dont play video games properly
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:22:30.418000+00:00) : its going to take you way longer than some store playtime to beat it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:22:02.413000+00:00) : this is different because its new
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:21:55.757000+00:00) : but for the witcher i didnt have any rush to get through the story
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:21:47.349000+00:00) : i mean you have a point, i did stop playing the witcher after 15 hours
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:21:00.235000+00:00) : botw will be no different
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:20:42.416000+00:00) : also part of the reason i beat it so fast was because i wanted to finish the story so i could look at the internet again
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:20:22.291000+00:00) : i spent some time catching rare dudes that i thought were cool
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:19:39.523000+00:00) : 60 actually
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:19:22.355000+00:00) : idk keenan i beat pokemon in 5 or 6 days
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:19:04.081000+00:00) : the only reason im taking so long to beat the other games because is because i play them like 3 hours every week
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:18:28.900000+00:00) : spring break is like two weeks after it comes out
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:18:01.982000+00:00) : thats not true
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:17:50.978000+00:00) : hows that not fair
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:16:51.636000+00:00) : i'll get it and play it through at the same time you get botw
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:16:23.479000+00:00) : i will at some point im sure
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:14:31.629000+00:00) : im pretty sure odyssey is going to be a tf2-esque hat simulator
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:12:09.021000+00:00) : yeah sure, but i havent bought it yet
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T20:06:17.574000+00:00) : im probably going to get it, 100% goes to charity this time. but there are a lot of games i already have so if anyone doesnt get it and wants the codes, let me know
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T19:15:30.635000+00:00) : https://www.humblebundle.com/freedom
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T18:59:44.544000+00:00) : lol i got a point of extra credit for drawing a diglett on my latin quiz
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T18:56:18.649000+00:00) : where shit that happened in lego batman would appear in the comics and othe rbatman movies later on
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T18:56:01.650000+00:00) : yeah so i though you meant the other way around
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T18:46:22.850000+00:00) : oh i see now
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T18:45:59.173000+00:00) : i thought that meant all of batman
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T18:45:53.333000+00:00) : oh you said just everything is canon
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T18:45:03.890000+00:00) : im not i dont understand
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T18:44:47.364000+00:00) : that seems a little shady
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T18:44:35.702000+00:00) : are they in a position to say its canon in all of the batman universe
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T18:44:26.559000+00:00) : who are the writers
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T18:44:12.382000+00:00) : who determined that it was canon
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T18:44:01.083000+00:00) : what do you mean its canon
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T18:43:17.054000+00:00) : in the same movie
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T18:43:16.742000+00:00) : how can there be more than one batman
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T18:42:48.464000+00:00) : to have every batman ever?
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T18:42:34.191000+00:00) : how is that a thing that makes it good
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T18:41:44.727000+00:00) : whats the benefit
71716577669550080 (2017-02-13T18:41:40.579000+00:00) : how does it have every batman ever

71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:29:49.762000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:29:31.496000+00:00) : but half of it is just a pokedex
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:29:25.086000+00:00) : i mean just a guidebook
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:29:12.221000+00:00) : i hope the sun/mmoon has 800
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:29:00.532000+00:00) : the emerald one i have has all 400 pokemon at the time in it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:28:21.376000+00:00) : i might have that around somewhere
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:27:22.618000+00:00) : although i doubt the sun/moon one has all 800 pokemon in it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:27:03.069000+00:00) : because they are just physical pokedexes
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:26:53.110000+00:00) : those are awesome
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:26:50.768000+00:00) : i need to buy one of the newer pokemon guidebooks
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:25:42.065000+00:00) : but i just dont know why so many people want it so soon
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:25:25.830000+00:00) : i mean i'll probably buy it eventually since it will probably have a useful item dex with stats and stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:24:56.931000+00:00) : is it that much of a collectors item though that it becomes best selling
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:24:10.548000+00:00) : then you just have a guidebook on how to beat a sucky game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:24:01.413000+00:00) : what if the game sucks
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:23:58.437000+00:00) : yeah but its not like the limited editions that you need to buy immediately
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:22:08.738000+00:00) : i love how people buy guidebooks without even playing the game yet
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:21:47.713000+00:00) : did you see how the botw official guide book is already the best selling book on amazon right now
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:20:21.468000+00:00) : thats the point right
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:20:14.864000+00:00) : its multiplayer right
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:20:09.093000+00:00) : cool
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:12:59.166000+00:00) : <@!127535721857679362> are you going to play dota tonight
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:10:56.867000+00:00) : i thought that green thing skips to the end
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:09:10.916000+00:00) : why wouldnt it just become any% at that point
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:08:57.897000+00:00) : because with that orb thing, arent you technically bypassing some of the levels
71716577669550080 (2017-02-12T00:08:39.276000+00:00) : i dont understand how people still can use glitches in the 11-gates category

71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T23:12:50.163000+00:00) : looks like it has really cool level design but the gameplay seems bland
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T23:03:54.690000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T22:12:03.721000+00:00) : its probably not worth it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T22:11:55.505000+00:00) : well actually it would be a two day thing since it starts at 7 am next sunday
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T16:22:49.811000+00:00) : does anyone want to go to chicago and play the switch
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T14:55:23.262000+00:00) : Yeah I want to play dota and tp today but I'll at least download it to see what its like
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T14:53:17.061000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T14:49:14.415000+00:00) : I don't know why it wouldn't be
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T14:48:11.880000+00:00) : Looks like it has really cool combat
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T14:48:11.867000+00:00) : Can't you get it on ps4 and we can play "together"
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T14:41:19.571000+00:00) : But it's free so why not
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T14:40:00.831000+00:00) : It's free right now though so i might as well try it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T14:39:36.746000+00:00) : No. It's also peer to peer servers which is pretty shit
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T14:38:57.688000+00:00) : It's literally just overwatch but with swords
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T14:36:54.950000+00:00) : Guys let's play for honor tonight
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T03:35:30.942000+00:00) : but they arent avengers!
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T03:31:03.336000+00:00) : wtf the guardians of the galaxy of going to be in infinity war
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T00:16:41.823000+00:00) : genre I suck at ☑
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T00:16:29.002000+00:00) : amazing artstyle ☑
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T00:15:55.455000+00:00) : amazing soundtrack ☑
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T00:15:37.110000+00:00) : hallow knight meets all my criteria for a good game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T00:08:57.227000+00:00) : CHRISTOPHER LARKIN THE LEGEND
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T00:04:40.885000+00:00) : i think you must be time traveling
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T00:03:24.518000+00:00) : there's like no press on it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T00:03:19.672000+00:00) : this game is super underated
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T00:02:50.232000+00:00) : its better
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T00:02:47.326000+00:00) : WATCH THIS ONE
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T00:02:02.881000+00:00) : but i think they tweeted this trailer only an hour ago
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T00:01:13.050000+00:00) : HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THINGS
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T00:01:08.932000+00:00) : HOW
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T00:01:06.091000+00:00) : how did you watch it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T00:01:02.732000+00:00) : but it jsut came out today
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T00:00:54.849000+00:00) : it's new
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T00:00:53.249000+00:00) : watch that trailer
71716577669550080 (2017-02-11T00:00:33.002000+00:00) : okay this is the game im most hyped for this year that im alst most likely to suck horribly at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAO2urG23S4
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:57:21.081000+00:00) : it might be hard to play for a new person but its not that hard
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:57:08.589000+00:00) : i also think ori and the blind forest is really cool to show someone who is new to games
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:56:08.455000+00:00) : the only mechanic is riding but its not even necessary
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:55:47.845000+00:00) : there are no actual mechanics in abzu you just swim and look at the pretty fish
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:55:35.284000+00:00) : abzu
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:54:36.650000+00:00) : to show her first
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:54:33.378000+00:00) : anyway i think there are better stylistic games
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:54:10.957000+00:00) : i think it's about havinga journey
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:53:43.315000+00:00) : yeah i watched you
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:53:25.673000+00:00) : a tutorial that doesnt have any text
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:52:51.716000+00:00) : i also think it would bhard to play that game/know what to do unless you are already familar with games
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:52:17.747000+00:00) : i dont mean not good as in bad i just mean not good for an introduction
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:51:43.207000+00:00) : journey is not a good game unless you understand games already
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:51:33.317000+00:00) : i dont get the point
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:51:15.737000+00:00) : you should show her either wii sports or some super stylized game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:50:35.996000+00:00) : whats wrong with how they look
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:49:36.614000+00:00) : which is 10x better
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:49:31.533000+00:00) : yeah or wii sports resort if you have that
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:48:47.370000+00:00) : wii sports
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:47:43.922000+00:00) : or to introduce her to gaming
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:47:39.491000+00:00) : just to have fun
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:47:37.229000+00:00) : whats the goal
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:45:33.349000+00:00) : rekt
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:45:24.592000+00:00) : theres that mansnion in gen 4 that you can only get past at night when the guards are asleep
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:44:57.774000+00:00) : pokemon also did day/night stealth differences first
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:44:20.960000+00:00) : #pokemondiditfirst
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:43:51.055000+00:00) : yeah because a 2d sprite cant be fully rendered
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:43:20.629000+00:00) : masuda is in like every pokemon game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:43:12.557000+00:00) : omg
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:42:42.763000+00:00) : idk why you're laughing
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:41:00.579000+00:00) : ly
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:40:56.691000+00:00) : serious
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:34:14.923000+00:00) : stealth is a major component
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:33:39.993000+00:00) : im talking about botw
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:33:14.985000+00:00) : zelda
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:31:15.273000+00:00) : You know what else has that mechanic
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:01:50.879000+00:00) : idk it seems like mgs is already your favorite game ever
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:00:03.739000+00:00) : cant you just go invisible
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T23:00:00.232000+00:00) : i still dont understand how stealth works in bethesda games
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:58:42.361000+00:00) : and theres a ton of completionist stuff i didnt do
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:58:29.624000+00:00) : i thought it was a really nice length
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:58:07.873000+00:00) : thats only a 15 hour campaign
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:58:03.990000+00:00) : you should play link between worlds
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:57:25.793000+00:00) : i really want to get into more jrpgs but they are just so damn long
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:56:24.240000+00:00) : i think it's good i just cant justify the price unless it's a retro game that i can get for cheaper anyway
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:56:01.630000+00:00) : oh ok
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:55:29.617000+00:00) : i thought you already thought that
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:55:23.293000+00:00) : you realized shorter is good?
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:55:17.034000+00:00) : what happened to you
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:54:06.357000+00:00) : i wanted to play xenoblade but then i heard the campaign was 70 hours
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:53:49.813000+00:00) : although more and more im starting to appreciate games with shorter campaigns because i dont have a lot of time if it's not during a break
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:52:54.357000+00:00) : i could probably spend 40 dollars on that game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:52:47.968000+00:00) : oh thats pretty good
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:52:24.788000+00:00) : how long is the campaign?
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:51:56.789000+00:00) : i like the ost the best
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:51:14.948000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:50:14.010000+00:00) : i thought he was just like a dumb version of samus
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:50:03.868000+00:00) : i never played snake in brawl
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:49:05.247000+00:00) : i knew it was a trademark but i onl thought it was for the recent game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:48:19.440000+00:00) : is that also the one where you hide in boxes
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:47:39.635000+00:00) : is that an mmorpg oor something
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:47:03.686000+00:00) : dont you like attach balloons to fallen enemies to add them to your collection
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:45:24.873000+00:00) : why are there base building mechanics
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:40:33.553000+00:00) : because there seems to be many more and more variety than in wind waker
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:40:23.711000+00:00) : but im excited for the role koroks will play
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:40:02.736000+00:00) : well of course who doesnt love gorons
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:39:31.867000+00:00) : they are like pokemon
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:39:27.677000+00:00) : i love the idea of koroks
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:38:40.904000+00:00) : it's like a korok elder or something
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:38:20.016000+00:00) : https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p180x540/16601659_1309754115752382_4412959903455905136_o.png?oh=7936ef729f0fec833cf600140b58b5ae&oe=5949F331
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:33:16.849000+00:00) : maybe you just designed a random npc
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:33:06.730000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T22:26:11.396000+00:00) : it's probably to appeal to the more western style of character customization
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T19:42:25.206000+00:00) : ive never done that before
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T19:42:20.749000+00:00) : when it comes out on youtube im literally adding every song to my list
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T19:42:05.808000+00:00) : it was just released today
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T19:42:01.140000+00:00) : you need to listen to this btw https://christopherlarkin.bandcamp.com/album/hollow-knight-original-soundtrack
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T19:41:06.232000+00:00) : idk probably nioh
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T19:37:15.233000+00:00) : oh i couldnt tell from the gameplay
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T19:36:46.469000+00:00) : im also not sure if you get longer in snake pass but maybe
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T19:36:36.307000+00:00) : it looks like rattle and roll also has a jump button
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T19:35:28.064000+00:00) : the screenshots look like frogger
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T19:34:58.122000+00:00) : it's just like frogger
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T19:34:54.988000+00:00) : im looking up rattle and roll too
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T19:33:59.992000+00:00) : nintendo owns both what?
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T19:33:14.354000+00:00) : but they clearly took a lot of inspiration from rare
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T19:33:01.480000+00:00) : i dont think anyone working on snake pass is from rare besides david wise
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T19:32:39.820000+00:00) : rattle and roll is the spiritual predecessor
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T19:31:55.028000+00:00) : the reason i think snake pass will be really cool aside from the composer is that it's a 3d platformer without a jump button
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T19:31:27.899000+00:00) : wise does any jungle-themed game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T19:31:20.470000+00:00) : they are both platformers

71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T13:28:57.141000+00:00) : yeah loading times do seem like they would be really long
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T13:27:55.046000+00:00) : but i think it has much higher textures/graphics by default

71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T02:37:02.853000+00:00) : David Wise might be the composer and if so I'm super hyped
71716577669550080 (2017-02-10T02:36:40.364000+00:00) : Oh do you know about that snake game?

71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:34:48.413000+00:00) : you need to practice being fully immersed in everything, no multitasking, including video games
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:30:32.774000+00:00) : F stands for Fterrible
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:30:06.601000+00:00) : then F
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:30:05.042000+00:00) : if i dont do it

71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:29:42.291000+00:00) : but who knows mario kart is like the biggest system seller so it might even be more out of stock
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:29:18.515000+00:00) : in a month mario kart will be out anyway
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:29:05.085000+00:00) : yeah or that
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:28:44.423000+00:00) : youd have to go right when stores open if you want any chance
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:27:46.135000+00:00) : that would be even better than using it and then sending it back
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:27:02.949000+00:00) : i dont know if you've noticed but keenan still has a SNES that works
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:26:02.157000+00:00) : especially between refurbished and new
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:25:54.512000+00:00) : there's no difference when it comes to game consoles

71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:20:31.330000+00:00) : but probably not you
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:20:24.877000+00:00) : i think i might be able to pass

71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:11:25.396000+00:00) : its definitely more white than the blond hair i have
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:10:54.697000+00:00) : it's blondish

71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:09:43.098000+00:00) : thats cool
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:09:40.347000+00:00) : also the guy on the cover has white hair
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:09:22.246000+00:00) : it just seems a lot darker
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:09:17.946000+00:00) : darksouls is definitely a cool world
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:08:58.462000+00:00) : it looked like it had cool oceans and ships
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:08:09.085000+00:00) : i like the world more
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:07:31.889000+00:00) : it just does
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:07:21.305000+00:00) : it just does
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:07:09.999000+00:00) : it seems like a game i would like a lot more than dark souls
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:05:07.043000+00:00) : yeah i heard that game has really cool stamina mechanics, and you can tell they focus on it because you can see the enemy's stamina meter
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:03:43.233000+00:00) : making something more japanese automatically makes it a ps4 exclusive
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:03:21.063000+00:00) : and ps4 exclusive
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:01:54.073000+00:00) : i was going to listen to that but i guess i'll just have to settle for diddy kong racing
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T20:01:30.674000+00:00) : it baffles me why people have extended versions of the nioh soundtrack up on youtube before the normal versions
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T19:58:48.444000+00:00) : lego batman
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T19:46:31.462000+00:00) : guess what comes out tomorrow
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T19:46:22.414000+00:00) : guys
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:32:41.279000+00:00) : lol grant kirkhope is so nice https://twitter.com/grantkirkhope/status/829499184856182784 look at that picture someone sent him
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:29:55.974000+00:00) : it's pretty cheap early on and gives you a big xp boost
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:29:45.757000+00:00) : level up your castle
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:29:43.295000+00:00) : oh also
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:26:41.483000+00:00) : yeah either use her, or level your other dudes up to 20 so you can get them more stars
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:24:52.647000+00:00) : but once you get someone to level 20 you can spend feathers to upgrade their star rating anyway so if you are already close to 20 you might want to just do that instead
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:23:50.631000+00:00) : it's definitely worth it to use someone with 4 or 5 stsars even if they are  a lower level
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:23:15.679000+00:00) : its like a more extreme version of IVs
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:23:08.397000+00:00) : even if they are a lower level, they have naturally higher stats
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:22:56.726000+00:00) : also do you have any people with stars
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:22:42.935000+00:00) : good because i forget
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:22:07.547000+00:00) : just go to Allies > level up or Allies > Learn Skills
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:21:29.273000+00:00) : and spend skill points if you have them built up on some characters
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:21:16.274000+00:00) : crystals are a currency exclusively used for leveling up your people so you might as well use those too
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:20:53.657000+00:00) : you can also use crystals to level them up
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:20:38.843000+00:00) : you can grind your dudes at the training tower
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:20:16.602000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:20:14.006000+00:00) : oh im not even there yet
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:18:21.610000+00:00) : which one
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:18:12.511000+00:00) : in a main story level?
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:17:50.418000+00:00) : how are you stuck
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:05:02.523000+00:00) : therefore it must be the real serious ronald
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:04:50.767000+00:00) : the real ronald wouldn't respond
71716577669550080 (2017-02-09T01:04:39.793000+00:00) : thats how you know it's not an imposter ronald

71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:57:37.073000+00:00) : i think it's a funny name regardless of the meaning

71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:53:35.447000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:49:33.101000+00:00) : i just noticed they did it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:48:32.795000+00:00) : because it was really blurry and shitty resolution
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:48:26.036000+00:00) : lol they filterized that photo
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:47:19.899000+00:00) : the difference here is that i specifically asked you to look at this though
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:45:59.412000+00:00) : you generously showed to us all
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:45:51.747000+00:00) : oh was it that publisher file
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:45:03.570000+00:00) : what flyer
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:24:33.558000+00:00) : like at least the people that lost the race for president still get to be senators
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:23:10.252000+00:00) : im also definitely more qualified than the other person running i just dont trust myself to get that fact across in a 2 minute speech
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:22:04.276000+00:00) : I could technically run for both positions but I dont want to split people's votes on me since I can ultimately only do one
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:21:32.703000+00:00) : but if i lose the race for managing editor, then i just become nothing 😦
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:21:19.529000+00:00) : im trying to become managing editor instead of IT board chair
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:21:01.339000+00:00) : google it i did their website
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:17:56.263000+00:00) : iujur
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:13:25.478000+00:00) : goddamnit im not running unopposed for an exec position so now i actually have to prepare
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:10:20.386000+00:00) : itsnot on android
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:08:37.345000+00:00) : Aside from your own work, are there any books concerning philosophy of mind that you can recommend?

John Searle: I don’t think any of them are any good really.
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:06:22.302000+00:00) : then it's basically the brain
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:06:15.689000+00:00) : where you just have a bunch of men working together manipulating symbols inside a big gym
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:05:49.824000+00:00) : there's another thought experiment called the chinese gym
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:03:25.571000+00:00) : yeah you could just say that the individual neurons in the brain don't understand the chemicals they are manipulating, yet the whole brain does have understading
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T03:00:03.089000+00:00) : admist all the high level AI and neuroscience we have now
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:59:49.950000+00:00) : also he still is adamant about his chinese room 37 years later
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:57:05.766000+00:00) : where he basically said he stopped reading books by other philosophers because he doesnt agree with any of them
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:56:50.466000+00:00) : i once read an interview with him
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:53:47.275000+00:00) : yeah thats why it can be confusing because any avid reader will notice a lot of problems that he doesnt really address
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:50:21.060000+00:00) : even if you dont accept that particular counterpoint, there are a bunch of others i could use too
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:49:49.425000+00:00) : but ultimately that set of rules is what defines your understanding of the symbol
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:49:29.339000+00:00) : i mean the ruleset can be huge and the definition can just get more and more complex
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:48:46.268000+00:00) : then that unknown symbol for "cat" is now partially defined by the rule that it should be placed in the same category as this other symbol for "dog"
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:48:17.754000+00:00) : i.e. everytime you see the chinese word for "cat" you pair it with some unknown symbol for "dog"
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:47:49.380000+00:00) : and apply some set of rules to it every time you see it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:47:41.585000+00:00) : like if you see some unkown symbol
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:47:07.874000+00:00) : like a chinese speaker would understand that he may be manipulating the word for "cat" but the understanding of that word for "cat" only comes from how it was used in relation to everything else in the first place
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:44:30.237000+00:00) : and you cant really argue that the human brain is doing anything more than that either
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:44:12.104000+00:00) : i would argue that the meaning of those syymbols is defined by the ruleset the man is using to manipulate them
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:43:51.595000+00:00) : yeah thats just one way his argument sucks
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:42:32.401000+00:00) : because all they do is manipulate symbols
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:42:25.738000+00:00) : hes trying to say that digital machines cant understand
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:41:24.843000+00:00) : anyway then why do i need to explain it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:41:02.055000+00:00) : like 15
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:41:00.842000+00:00) : i thought it was a lot longer
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:40:32.399000+00:00) : and if you read his paper on the chinese room you'll see why
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:40:24.073000+00:00) : he is
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:39:56.925000+00:00) : thats the chinese room
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:39:48.180000+00:00) : searle is an asshole
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:39:31.571000+00:00) : because i coudlnt resist
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:39:25.250000+00:00) : AND I LOOKED AT IT
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:39:17.646000+00:00) : gameinformer already revealed what one of th emajor bosses was
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:38:45.590000+00:00) : no one will just casually mention spoilers online for a new game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:38:25.356000+00:00) : plus they spoiler tagged stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:38:17.617000+00:00) : well for pokemon i just never went to /r/pokemon and was fine
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:36:36.233000+00:00) : now real spoilers will be everywhere
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:36:25.391000+00:00) : giving the press access to the game so soon is bad
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:36:15.239000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:36:08.511000+00:00) : do they not understand the concept of "spoilers"
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:35:57.250000+00:00) : 4 weeks before release
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:35:50.720000+00:00) : and practically review the whole thing
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:35:45.375000+00:00) : does nintendo let game informer play botw
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:35:37.603000+00:00) : why the hell
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:30:31.544000+00:00) : the tutorial of mario and luigi dream team is like 10
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:30:19.719000+00:00) : thats nothing
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:15:59.957000+00:00) : but none for the most anticipated game of 2017
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:14:55.347000+00:00) : and will cost millions
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:14:45.766000+00:00) : because the special edition is limited
71716577669550080 (2017-02-08T02:14:34.426000+00:00) : except you wont

71716577669550080 (2017-02-07T02:13:48.635000+00:00) : some people submitted .java files with comments as answers
71716577669550080 (2017-02-07T02:13:34.946000+00:00) : no they could have done any thing
71716577669550080 (2017-02-07T02:13:13.697000+00:00) : because they didnt turn in the majority of hte problems

71716577669550080 (2017-02-06T20:12:01.875000+00:00) : i think thats only because he hasnt played anything other than fps rpgs
71716577669550080 (2017-02-06T20:11:30.661000+00:00) : he can play it on that

71716577669550080 (2017-02-06T20:10:24.820000+00:00) : i only brought it up because ronald cant figure out what games to play and i told him he has barely played any of the classics
71716577669550080 (2017-02-06T20:08:32.570000+00:00) : a lot more than that
71716577669550080 (2017-02-06T19:47:29.122000+00:00) : <@!127535721857679362> I think you've only played 4 or 5 games on this list
71716577669550080 (2017-02-06T19:43:38.402000+00:00) : this is pretty cool: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_considered_the_best
71716577669550080 (2017-02-06T18:11:30.886000+00:00) : yeah i saw apparently whole regions of the city where they are bootcamping dont have internet
71716577669550080 (2017-02-06T16:33:11.876000+00:00) : weird
71716577669550080 (2017-02-06T16:32:49.070000+00:00) : the ds4 dousnt have it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-06T16:32:19.785000+00:00) : probably not enough games used it so it wasnt worth including
71716577669550080 (2017-02-06T16:31:54.086000+00:00) : i see
71716577669550080 (2017-02-06T16:30:40.857000+00:00) : do you mean analogue triggers
71716577669550080 (2017-02-06T03:41:53.395000+00:00) : <@!155893986605793281> I found it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSEQCVtk2dA
71716577669550080 (2017-02-06T00:16:00.108000+00:00) : DAC qualifiers

71716577669550080 (2017-02-06T00:05:46.196000+00:00) : ew
71716577669550080 (2017-02-05T23:58:27.649000+00:00) : != seems like you're negating a variable assignment or something
71716577669550080 (2017-02-05T23:58:12.973000+00:00) : which makes more sense to me since == is the comparison and ! is negating it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-05T23:57:51.096000+00:00) : also I guess only javascript and python lets you do !==
71716577669550080 (2017-02-05T23:57:20.468000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-02-05T23:43:06.513000+00:00) : For some reason I had to do != Instead of ! .equals
71716577669550080 (2017-02-05T22:16:18.034000+00:00) : fuck this language
71716577669550080 (2017-02-05T22:16:06.147000+00:00) : WHY IS NOT EQUALS !=
71716577669550080 (2017-02-05T22:15:56.456000+00:00) : FUCKING JAVA
71716577669550080 (2017-02-05T22:10:16.371000+00:00) : i beat it yesterday, it's a pretty good game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-05T22:08:55.788000+00:00) : oh ok

71716577669550080 (2017-02-05T21:23:11.369000+00:00) : i havent gotten all the way through 4 yet
71716577669550080 (2017-02-05T21:22:23.282000+00:00) : in terms of ost 3 is the best
71716577669550080 (2017-02-05T21:20:31.545000+00:00) : mhmm although apparently the ending is bad because kojima didnt want konami to keep making him make mgs
71716577669550080 (2017-02-05T21:19:24.839000+00:00) : before you played mgs
71716577669550080 (2017-02-05T21:19:11.288000+00:00) : remember when yous aid mgsv was a bad game

71716577669550080 (2017-02-04T01:34:37.767000+00:00) : it reminds me of ori and the blind forest except handdrawn

71716577669550080 (2017-02-03T01:42:56.896000+00:00) : later in the ad that girl sits on the bed next to him and rubs his back but he's still playing away
71716577669550080 (2017-02-03T01:41:11.180000+00:00) : "Then you have this guy here, who’s so enamored with the Nintendo Switch that he can’t even be bothered to look away from his screen while an attractive woman is dancing right in front of him. According to the commercial he’s playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, so he’s not even overlooking sex in favor of a new game. That shit’s three years old. The implication is clear — he’s had so much sex following his purchasing of the Switch that he no longer feels compelled to even avert his eyes from a 3-year-old game to take a passing glance at a pair of pirouetting buttocks. Make no mistake, this guy fucks."

71716577669550080 (2017-02-03T01:14:59.792000+00:00) : i think i like the graphics in this game better than the normal fire emblem games
71716577669550080 (2017-02-03T01:13:38.953000+00:00) : just makes them into a single stronger version which makes sense

71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T01:00:22.661000+00:00) : i think you can use keyboard mouse but no one does because it's terrible for rocket league
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:58:56.390000+00:00) : becauase it's literally the only game to do it

71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:57:23.678000+00:00) : but between ps4 and pc
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:57:20.975000+00:00) : just not between ps4 and xbox

71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:52:17.286000+00:00) : sort of but garry's mod had much smaller server sizes
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:51:42.318000+00:00) : and maybe taking on a new persona
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:51:36.886000+00:00) : just go in with the mindset you are starting fresh each time
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:51:28.123000+00:00) : and not worrying about preserving your stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:51:19.667000+00:00) : i think rust would be more fun to just log on and mess around every once in a while
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:50:31.376000+00:00) : there was also some resemblence of a government with laws
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:50:10.063000+00:00) : civcraft was cool once you established yourself
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:49:52.406000+00:00) : nah then it just turns into an mmorpg
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:49:10.661000+00:00) : but i mean if you ahd a group of friends it wouldnt be so bad because you could hunt as a pack
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:48:38.922000+00:00) : and so you have to fear everyone
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:48:17.703000+00:00) : its basicaly survival minecraft multiplayer but if the server had absolutely no rules
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:47:53.304000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:47:20.623000+00:00) : which is why i havent bought it even when it goes on sale
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:47:09.542000+00:00) : i also dont think i would get a lot of hours out of rust unless all my friends had it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:46:29.063000+00:00) : yeah ofc
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:46:11.406000+00:00) : plus i have no way of buying it used
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:46:04.369000+00:00) : i just dont think i can get that many hours out of it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:45:52.705000+00:00) : maybe
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:44:41.350000+00:00) : rust is multiplayer
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:44:38.539000+00:00) : i disagree
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:44:23.462000+00:00) : ya and charged triple a pricing
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:41:54.506000+00:00) : but if you buy it used its not supporting the devs
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:41:36.535000+00:00) : i also dont really want to support the devs because they seem kind of shitty
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:40:51.795000+00:00) : so even at 15 it's still too much
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:40:45.207000+00:00) : yeah just for me though i think i could only get about 5 hours out of that game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:39:16.662000+00:00) : well of course if they were free id get them too
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:37:54.276000+00:00) : because there's a good chance they will and now since the technology is there to make those games portable, i want everything portable
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:37:13.366000+00:00) : im kind of waiting on buying a lot of those indie games though to see if they come on switch
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:35:37.061000+00:00) : heard good things about both
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:35:30.404000+00:00) : that and the witness
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:35:09.711000+00:00) : yeah i wanted to get that game next time it goes on sale
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:34:21.056000+00:00) : i saw
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:33:13.920000+00:00) : for everything
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:33:09.586000+00:00) : or actually you hold the wiimote and i control the nunchuck
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:32:48.694000+00:00) : we actually just trade off at every boss
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:32:07.872000+00:00) : so uh midway through the campaign
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:31:56.598000+00:00) : i know in reality we each own half of each game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:31:44.421000+00:00) : i know dude
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:31:42.737000+00:00) : actually i'll wait to determine which is the bes until i play
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:31:18.429000+00:00) : but the best
71716577669550080 (2017-02-02T00:30:34.898000+00:00) : no i want to own metroid prime 1 and half of 2 instead
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T23:11:45.917000+00:00) : I'll pay you next time i see you or on Venmo if you have that
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T23:07:39.367000+00:00) : Let's do it
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T23:07:34.243000+00:00) : Nice
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T23:02:10.880000+00:00) : Like the collection or individually?
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T23:01:44.289000+00:00) : For Wii?
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T18:06:47.401000+00:00) : no he evolved from a cute little citizen of an animal town into a psychopathic killer who now runs the whole town
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T18:03:55.686000+00:00) : well last year was the biggest year for pokemon ever so maybe that ad helped
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T18:00:52.010000+00:00) : and the anniversary
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T18:00:45.911000+00:00) : just pokemon
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T18:00:43.360000+00:00) : that one was awesome since it wasnt marketed about a specific game
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T18:00:31.946000+00:00) : the 20th anniversary one
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T18:00:25.867000+00:00) : do you remember the pokemon ad they did last year
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T17:58:49.628000+00:00) : there are kids in it for like 2 seconds
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T17:58:45.320000+00:00) : anyway did you see the superbowl ad
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T17:57:39.690000+00:00) : i am triggered
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T17:57:02.802000+00:00) : i think your logic is wrong here
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T17:56:37.757000+00:00) : going by price, wii u must be 0/10 of a psn
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T17:55:46.994000+00:00) : psn is 10/10
71716577669550080 (2017-02-01T17:55:42.206000+00:00) : so then

71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T21:23:34.404000+00:00) : noooooo
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T21:16:55.763000+00:00) : I just love how thats a headline
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T21:14:52.773000+00:00) : wtf http://gonintendo.com/stories/273023-after-17-years-a-new-hidden-coin-is-discovered-in-donkey-kong-64
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T21:12:48.920000+00:00) : moral of the show
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T21:12:45.640000+00:00) : it was just all just a prank
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T21:12:31.439000+00:00) : like they take off in a plane but guess what the plane wasnt actually real and it was just a prop
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T21:12:08.739000+00:00) : im reading the plot of the sequel now and i forgot how crazy/random it is
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T21:11:52.984000+00:00) : yeah i think it was a good concept
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T21:10:36.559000+00:00) : they aren't very memorable movies i guess
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T21:10:26.873000+00:00) : and i completely forgot what the sequel was and that i had even watched it until i looked up the plot summary just now
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T21:10:01.659000+00:00) : i think i watched both it and the sequel at the beginning of the semester last year
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T21:08:00.966000+00:00) : well thats really what magic is
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T21:07:24.957000+00:00) : and that it was strange
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T21:07:17.057000+00:00) : i just remember it had good music and some cool magic tricks
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T21:06:21.354000+00:00) : it was kind of strange
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T21:05:36.007000+00:00) : yea
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T18:11:43.299000+00:00) : can you get skins or something
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T17:44:05.138000+00:00) : sony is really lacking on the color front
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T17:43:55.126000+00:00) : although the newer xbox one controllers have way better color options than ds4
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T17:42:27.131000+00:00) : and im more hyped for the switch pro controller than the actuall system
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T17:41:51.552000+00:00) : half the reason i want a ps4 is just because the controllers are cool
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T17:41:27.378000+00:00) : i like the hardware
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T17:40:01.692000+00:00) : but i kind of want one of each
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T17:39:51.770000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T17:39:12.238000+00:00) : apparently they work pretty well on windows pcs now
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T17:38:23.677000+00:00) : i think i need to buy a ds4 controller
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T17:35:38.770000+00:00) : It seemed really hard
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T17:30:41.953000+00:00) : Oh you weren't there the night he discovered it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T17:13:12.573000+00:00) : cool
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T17:11:12.972000+00:00) : on ninja kiwi ?
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T17:10:50.460000+00:00) : is it still an online game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T17:09:45.503000+00:00) : thats another one of those nostalgia games for me
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T17:09:37.420000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T16:55:08.861000+00:00) : who instead of writing a book, made a game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T16:54:58.838000+00:00) : the developers
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T16:54:16.393000+00:00) : i feel like unless the game is designed specifically to be played that way, then you're missing out
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T16:50:43.553000+00:00) : 😦
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T16:50:16.294000+00:00) : then it becomes uncharted 4
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T16:50:06.969000+00:00) : ifi you only care about the story and do that then it's no different from a book or a movie
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T16:18:53.722000+00:00) : like if i grind too much in rpgs it just becomes an Attack-mashing progression through the story and nothing else
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T16:17:01.185000+00:00) : but for me it's just enough so to add some variety
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T16:16:45.450000+00:00) : its not even like survival is that difficult especially when we disable losing items on death
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T16:15:17.155000+00:00) : i think the best way to keep my attention is having a variety of things to do
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T16:05:43.009000+00:00) : i can imagine the same being true for hhd although ive never palyed it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T16:05:14.971000+00:00) : ultimately the 1-dimensional play style of creative minecraft is what makes it boring after a while
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T16:04:55.659000+00:00) : even with godlike progression there's still a greater challenge in survival and that makes it feel less monotonous by breaking up the segments where you're just building blocks and makes it feel more like  a game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:45:38.526000+00:00) : it's probably the same reason why i get bored of minecraft creative mode since i dont have to work for any of the stuff and there's no progression
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:43:48.686000+00:00) : like the mechanics in that game should just be directly implemented into a larger AC game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:43:21.409000+00:00) : i feel like the whole home designing experience is useless by itself, id rather have the rest of the world to design too
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:42:56.809000+00:00) : do you hvae it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:42:43.739000+00:00) : but i dont like the home designing experience just by itself
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:42:29.051000+00:00) : thats actually not a bad game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:42:01.865000+00:00) : thats animal crossing and not splatoon 2
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:41:46.634000+00:00) : i hope animal crossing mobile being delayed means the animal crossing team is working on a real game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:39:56.715000+00:00) : yeah those were probably my first pc game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:39:12.004000+00:00) : that was even before 4th grade
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:39:02.231000+00:00) : i need to get one of those again sometime
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:38:51.557000+00:00) : i also played like all the magic school bus games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:38:44.183000+00:00) : oh shit
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:37:53.317000+00:00) : rip club penguin
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:37:49.945000+00:00) : anyways
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:35:49.232000+00:00) : i fucking love elmo
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:34:57.638000+00:00) : dont remember them though
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:34:51.949000+00:00) : i played some weird typing games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:34:38.483000+00:00) : and then for pc it was probably age of mythology and then lego star wars which came out in 2005
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:33:27.177000+00:00) : i know that for sure
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:33:23.720000+00:00) : my literal first game ever was pokemon emerald
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:32:31.537000+00:00) : 2005
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:32:25.933000+00:00) : but nope
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:32:22.434000+00:00) : for some reason i was thinking that i was 9 years old in 2008 or some shit
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:32:05.149000+00:00) : then it would make sense
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:32:02.166000+00:00) : yeah i just need to match up my age, with the year, and with my current grade
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:31:48.729000+00:00) : so it must have ibeen in 2009 since galaxy 2 came out in 2010
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:31:38.544000+00:00) : i remember that mario galaxy 2 came out the year after i got the wii
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:31:24.865000+00:00) : and then the wii in 2009
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:31:19.308000+00:00) : and then i got the ds a couple years later in like 2007
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:31:08.860000+00:00) : ok so maybe i got the gameboy sp in 2005
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:30:53.922000+00:00) : wtf
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:30:52.400000+00:00) : i was 10 in 2006
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:30:46.642000+00:00) : shit fuck
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:30:34.400000+00:00) : the same year i got the ds lite
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:30:27.480000+00:00) : or 2009
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:30:22.872000+00:00) : i got the wii in like 2010
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:30:16.526000+00:00) : i never got consoles right when they came out until the 3ds
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:29:39.368000+00:00) : and i got pokemon diamond
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:29:33.049000+00:00) : probably around 2009
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:29:24.864000+00:00) : i remember saving up for a whole summer to get a nintendo ds
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:28:52.557000+00:00) : i probably beat the age of mythology campaign 3 or 4 times
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:28:41.180000+00:00) : like 100% completion since those were the only games i had
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:28:28.085000+00:00) : hardcore on pc
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:28:25.200000+00:00) : and i also started playing poptropica and age of mythology and lego star wars and lego indiana jones
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:27:50.394000+00:00) : so yeah i got a gameboy when i was 9 along with pokemon emerald and sapphire, and a bunch of other 3rd party games that really sucked looking at them now but were the best thing ever back then
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:27:01.010000+00:00) : i think 9 years old is the age of fourth grade or so
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:26:31.536000+00:00) : i also got a gameboy sp when i was 9
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:26:19.663000+00:00) : i dont really think i started gaming at all until 4th grade when my we got a family desktop i could use
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:25:08.984000+00:00) : i was mainly a pc gamer from an aearly age
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:25:00.282000+00:00) : i never told you my console story but it's a lot less robust than yours
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:24:09.050000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:24:02.768000+00:00) : that's my onling gaming saga
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:23:55.695000+00:00) : mixed in
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:23:53.140000+00:00) : and it's still dota with some overwatch
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:23:47.042000+00:00) : and then dota
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:23:45.207000+00:00) : and that lasted until sophomore year in highschool
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:23:23.962000+00:00) : and then i got into minecraft around 2009 or 2010
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:21:52.927000+00:00) : runescape was early middle school
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:21:47.956000+00:00) : poptropica and club penguin were sometime in 4-6th grade
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:21:29.735000+00:00) : i cant remember the order in which i play/grew out of them but runescape was the final stage
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:20:01.874000+00:00) : i have an insane amount of nostalgia for those games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-31T15:19:22.697000+00:00) : club penguin, poptropica, and runescape were my big three childhood online gaming experiences

71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T22:58:11.437000+00:00) : i would just see someone
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T22:55:39.176000+00:00) : if it doesnt go away after a couple days then yeah its worth it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T22:54:36.354000+00:00) : i dont think we're qualified to diagnose that
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T22:51:54.113000+00:00) : i mean it's a headache in the sense that things up close are more blurry so it takes more effort to focus on them
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T22:51:25.628000+00:00) : it happens when i go to bigger cities with more pollution usually
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T22:50:56.358000+00:00) : sometimes when my allergies act up, my vision changes and becomes worse temporarily
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T18:13:51.995000+00:00) : It's raining dipping dots guys
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T04:29:08.104000+00:00) : So I save like every 20 min
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T04:28:59.185000+00:00) : Popping out a cart is my worst nightmare
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T04:28:37.247000+00:00) : No one talks about how not only is the switch's card slot on the back, it also has a cover so that accidental pop out won't happen
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T02:39:50.974000+00:00) : yeto and yeta are the best
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T00:45:39.184000+00:00) : But maybe Nintendo has done this before with some of their smaller IPS
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T00:45:26.677000+00:00) : Yeah it's kind of unprecedented as far as i know
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T00:39:08.780000+00:00) : Wasn't Rare the last non Japanese studio to develop for nintendo
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T00:38:34.130000+00:00) : Which doesn't happen often
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T00:38:28.668000+00:00) : Is this is a Nintendo IP not made by a Japanese studio
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T00:38:16.823000+00:00) : The other thing though
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T00:37:45.442000+00:00) : It's good for them
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T00:37:41.486000+00:00) : Thia is the biggest thing their studio has done
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T00:33:37.542000+00:00) : They wouldn't have enough agreed to work with Nintendo if they thought they would make more money by doing it themselves
71716577669550080 (2017-01-29T00:32:45.522000+00:00) : It's still going to make them legit

71716577669550080 (2017-01-28T02:37:04.894000+00:00) : I'm on my way home and then I can play
71716577669550080 (2017-01-27T00:02:36.667000+00:00) : these adjectives though "including the chance to receive an implausibly indescribably-rare Immortal Dark Moon Baby Roshan courier of peerless origin."
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T23:35:34.103000+00:00) : oh yeah it we have to do a bunch of security
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T23:28:07.439000+00:00) : why is it terrible
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T23:09:44.794000+00:00) : but german has them make websites
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T23:09:40.264000+00:00) : it's h212 which is the java class

71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T22:42:52.497000+00:00) : i did for this class
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T22:42:41.269000+00:00) : im just saying you can never overestimate someones ability
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T22:42:29.657000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T22:41:56.670000+00:00) : because people didnt know how
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T22:41:52.049000+00:00) : i just had to teach an honors computer science class how to make zip archives so they could submit their homework properly

71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T22:21:55.820000+00:00) : keenan you know how i always specify trivial things like how to make a zip file
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T21:08:22.809000+00:00) : maybe he'll teach you a new language
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T21:08:15.030000+00:00) : you should just ask him
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T21:07:12.780000+00:00) : my expert analysis senses tell me that it's his own made up language
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T21:05:33.539000+00:00) : ...
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T21:05:00.130000+00:00) : they might not even be notes, i mean you're the one writing an mgs ananlysis

71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T17:34:38.940000+00:00) : lol the new german nintendo switch commercial shows someone using it while pooping
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:47:13.236000+00:00) : since bw2 was a sequal they probably decided to keep the same engine as stuff as the original bw
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:46:56.305000+00:00) : and then bw2 came out in the 3ds's first year
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:46:46.509000+00:00) : the original black and white came out a year before the 3ds
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:46:31.099000+00:00) : not a 3ds game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:46:25.969000+00:00) : but it was a ds game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:44:43.796000+00:00) : theyve always used pixel art until gen 6

71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:40:36.857000+00:00) : but the overworld in gen 5 is my favorite
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:40:30.701000+00:00) : maybe the pokemon sprites
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:39:16.249000+00:00) : i really like gen 5

71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:33:49.943000+00:00) : without further research
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:33:45.488000+00:00) : its hard to actually define the best
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:33:35.144000+00:00) : ok maybe i meant the best recently
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:32:30.105000+00:00) : it's still good
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:32:28.050000+00:00) : but even if you ignore their shit

71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:29:29.080000+00:00) : in 13 years everyone will be like wow 2017 had so many classic comes out
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:28:53.481000+00:00) : you're just old school
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:26:48.726000+00:00) : a new kingdom hearts maybe
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:26:22.709000+00:00) : and they are all lining up this year
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:26:17.725000+00:00) : but still all these big series usually take a while for new games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:26:07.138000+00:00) : new ff came last year

71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:25:36.864000+00:00) : but the only thing missing this year is some new elder scrolls or fallout game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:25:17.368000+00:00) : rip
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:25:04.954000+00:00) : stuff that usually has long 3-5 year cycles
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:24:48.732000+00:00) : a lot of big series are getting new games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:24:25.791000+00:00) : im just saying in general

71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:23:09.358000+00:00) : 2017 is going to be the best year for games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:20:35.913000+00:00) : i just heard people were excited for it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:20:29.793000+00:00) : i dont really know anything about it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:20:16.043000+00:00) : isnt that new spiderman game supposed to be good. im not sure if it's an rpg though
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:19:43.182000+00:00) : it does sound pretty hype
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:18:52.584000+00:00) : you never know
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:18:19.810000+00:00) : literally no info
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:18:16.247000+00:00) : so in other words
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:18:13.192000+00:00) : you never know
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:18:10.329000+00:00) : maybe today is the day they decided to do something new
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:17:59.756000+00:00) : just ebcause square only makes rpgs
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:17:52.683000+00:00) : its an rpg
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:17:46.337000+00:00) : you cant just assume
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:13:31.400000+00:00) : whats the point of hyping up some announcement if they dont tell us anything
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:13:20.672000+00:00) : literally no info
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T15:13:17.390000+00:00) : i nkow
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T14:45:07.044000+00:00) : humble bundle is also announcing something today so for all we know it could just be a square/marvel themed humble bundle
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T14:43:29.553000+00:00) : i personally hope they are not related so i can get more info about dragon quest or octopath
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T14:42:54.110000+00:00) : i wonder if square and marvel are actually doing something or if they just happen to be making announcements on the same day
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T05:04:20.674000+00:00) : https://twitter.com/Babylonian/status/824481721936596992
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:11:40.167000+00:00) : why is the hud blue
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:09:14.555000+00:00) : how the fuck did i get 13 hours in a demo with only 1 stage and 5 playable characters
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:09:00.120000+00:00) : and 47 hours in the full 3ds game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:08:50.609000+00:00) : dude i checked the other day and somehow i have 13 hours in the smash for 3ds demo
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:08:34.538000+00:00) : all before release
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:08:29.547000+00:00) : and smash
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:08:27.034000+00:00) : so did pokemon moon
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:08:10.105000+00:00) : via a demo
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:08:06.055000+00:00) : you can play yoshi and poochy right now
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:07:15.395000+00:00) : demo downloads are better
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:06:23.437000+00:00) : BUT NO
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:06:21.105000+00:00) : i just was looking forward to listening to the soundtrack before even starting the game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:05:48.023000+00:00) : i think i have some cd playing device at home
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:04:03.005000+00:00) : why dont they give you a flash drive
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:03:58.566000+00:00) : who even has cd players
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:03:18.906000+00:00) : this ruins everything
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:03:15.799000+00:00) : ugh
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:02:11.228000+00:00) : i just realized im going to need a cd player to play my botw ost cd when it comes out
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T04:01:52.288000+00:00) : fuck
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:53:19.924000+00:00) : yeah i heard mgs5 is good game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:49:41.019000+00:00) : zle
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:49:37.154000+00:00) : puz
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:48:24.091000+00:00) : yeah it's an obstacle for unlocking the optional quest
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:46:36.812000+00:00) : ok buddy but im not letting you get away with this not a puzzle nonsense
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:46:12.288000+00:00) : it can be both an optional quest and a puzzle
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:44:45.580000+00:00) : therefore a puzzle
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:44:42.771000+00:00) : youi have to figure it out
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:44:39.764000+00:00) : but it doesnt seem like that quest is strictly given to you
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:43:35.322000+00:00) : yeah so an optional puzzle
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:42:49.781000+00:00) : puzzling
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:42:45.884000+00:00) : its like those room escape games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:41:49.416000+00:00) : its an option puzzle
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:41:26.388000+00:00) : i think of it as a puzzle
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:40:54.556000+00:00) : ww has very different types of puzzles
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:39:20.857000+00:00) : just interesting to see the comparison
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:39:12.201000+00:00) : not liek either way is worse than another
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:39:05.411000+00:00) : and wont be the same type of creativity you see in something more sandbox like botw
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:38:49.432000+00:00) : but also that type of creativity is scripted
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:38:31.004000+00:00) : i mean that type of stuff is what separates a good game from a great game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:36:02.779000+00:00) : mgs ;ets you jack them off
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:35:45.955000+00:00) : let me guess
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:35:26.553000+00:00) : sure
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:33:23.224000+00:00) : got to write it first
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:32:56.594000+00:00) : i think it would be fun to formalize all that in a review
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:32:23.443000+00:00) : i also have a list of anticipated problems with botw that will prevent it from being goty
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:31:58.862000+00:00) : i have a google doc of all my problems with pokemon moon
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:31:51.422000+00:00) : also i just like coming up with negative things for games that i really like
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:31:25.940000+00:00) : other people who might want to try it for the first time would be interested
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:31:08.739000+00:00) : also framing it from the perspective that you are examing mgs for the first time 10-20 years later is interesting
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:30:46.156000+00:00) : it'd be an interesting practice
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:29:40.990000+00:00) : i already established that im going to do that just for fun for zelda
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:29:24.009000+00:00) : you need to write a full length review for the mgs series
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:27:24.286000+00:00) : not exactly the same as mgs but similar as in repeated tries wont become not engaging
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:26:47.580000+00:00) : it just seems liek procedurally generated levels is something you would like
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:25:31.641000+00:00) : why dont you play more rouge-likes
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:22:28.467000+00:00) : yea
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:22:13.794000+00:00) : i mean it saves your keys and switchs and stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:22:03.971000+00:00) : in a way
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:21:12.356000+00:00) : and also snipperclips
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:20:52.122000+00:00) : and btw that kind of creativity with puzzle is exactly what botw is advertising
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:19:40.010000+00:00) : because it seemed to me like something every game has
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:19:24.767000+00:00) : and why it might be cool in mgs
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:19:17.127000+00:00) : well then i guess i am only now understanding what you are referring to
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:18:16.409000+00:00) : and they dont give any hints on where to find it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:18:08.120000+00:00) : is filled with stuff to find in every game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:18:01.613000+00:00) : the whole map and environment
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:17:29.668000+00:00) : rather than setting it up as having multiple options for a puzzle, and rewarding you for finding other options, it allows you to use stuff in creative ways to find secrets elsewhere
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:14:11.387000+00:00) : zelda isn'y about combat you cant really use boss fights as an example.
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:13:57.542000+00:00) : depends what you define as extra
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:13:25.951000+00:00) : also on a scale of 1 - 10 im at about a 2 in terms of investment in this argument
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:12:46.304000+00:00) : because you are required to understand every mechanic to progress but you can always do extra for more reward
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:11:34.742000+00:00) : well then you can say the same for zelda
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:10:50.424000+00:00) : every game rewards mastery of certain mechanics
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:10:31.329000+00:00) : now you're saying it rewards ability rather than being a requirement to beat the game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:09:47.731000+00:00) : like what if it's the norm to deviate from the perceived norm
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:09:35.630000+00:00) : is it really the norm then
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:08:59.581000+00:00) : ok when i ever play the game i will see about htat
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:08:05.936000+00:00) : it never was
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:08:01.325000+00:00) : aiming is not a core mechanic of zelda games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:07:24.873000+00:00) : with the sword
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:07:22.300000+00:00) : windwaker twilight princess and skyward sword all have enemies that you need to defeat in certain ways
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:06:31.526000+00:00) : but you do need to have fluency
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:06:25.006000+00:00) : you dont necessarily need all the upgrades
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:06:12.108000+00:00) : you still need some level of mastery with every item or ability in zelda before you can beat the game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:04:05.963000+00:00) : twilight princess has a lot of horse chase segments
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:03:57.821000+00:00) : that you need to pass
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:03:54.390000+00:00) : in severqal games there are horse parts
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:03:40.264000+00:00) : zelda is known for it's minigames
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:03:24.021000+00:00) : because it's just a minigame
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:02:41.287000+00:00) : but you still have to learn all the functions
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:02:24.242000+00:00) : well then dont use ambigous pronouns boy
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:02:09.677000+00:00) : oh
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:01:57.383000+00:00) : isnt that zelda
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T01:01:01.251000+00:00) : hows it different from zelda then
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:59:36.694000+00:00) : what else do you do in metal gear besides shooting and stealth
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:57:40.883000+00:00) : but it also isnt an rpg
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:56:58.180000+00:00) : their mechanics are so complex they cant possibly make you learn eerything
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:56:39.640000+00:00) : yeah but thats true of any rpg
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:55:31.141000+00:00) : beating the e4 with a full competitive team sounds pretty challenging
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:54:42.106000+00:00) : earthbound is actually a challenging game if you let it be
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:54:01.441000+00:00) : cant win a ti though
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:52:49.763000+00:00) : dota
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:52:23.727000+00:00) : what are features
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:51:02.127000+00:00) : it still probably dimishes the attention you can put towards work
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:50:05.553000+00:00) : because it still takes a little bit of focus to grind
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:49:57.889000+00:00) : it seems counter intruitive to me especially if you're imptient
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:45:04.480000+00:00) : you can and you shouldnt need to grind to do so
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:42:21.866000+00:00) : if it's too easy then there's no strategy involved which is what i care about
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:41:52.665000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:40:49.305000+00:00) : grinding early on is pretty bad compared to later
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:40:29.462000+00:00) : the curve is a lot different from pokemon
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:39:49.767000+00:00) : sure but when you progress the next area is like 200-300 or more
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:39:00.210000+00:00) : except early on the areas give like no xp
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:34:26.375000+00:00) : why
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:31:32.045000+00:00) : pocket
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:31:22.090000+00:00) : i think either a third or half of it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:31:08.768000+00:00) : you lose money
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:23:57.065000+00:00) : or go to hotels and stay the night
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:23:47.077000+00:00) : or food
71716577669550080 (2017-01-26T00:23:44.897000+00:00) : you use psi
71716577669550080 (2017-01-25T22:26:52.616000+00:00) : "Not capable of actual shapeshifting disguises!"
71716577669550080 (2017-01-25T22:26:44.764000+00:00) : "Large enough to be seated at the dinner table!"
71716577669550080 (2017-01-25T22:26:14.390000+00:00) : https://www.pokemoncenter.com/ditto-large-cushion---25-701-02417
71716577669550080 (2017-01-25T22:11:25.715000+00:00) : but apparently that was enough to cause me to completely not udnerstand what is happening in my lecture right now
71716577669550080 (2017-01-25T22:11:04.031000+00:00) : keenan you distracted me for like 30 seconds
71716577669550080 (2017-01-25T22:03:48.950000+00:00) : i tend to ignore all pokemon spin off games even official pokemon company ones

71716577669550080 (2017-01-25T22:00:46.768000+00:00) : if i were a monster hunter fan i would suggest monster rancher 4
71716577669550080 (2017-01-25T22:00:11.758000+00:00) : its name sounds the most like legend of zelda
71716577669550080 (2017-01-25T21:59:26.886000+00:00) : probably the legend one
71716577669550080 (2017-01-25T21:57:55.879000+00:00) : why are you asking me
71716577669550080 (2017-01-25T18:54:09.995000+00:00) : ok screw the dipping dots ones, this is my new favorite headline http://www.cbsnews.com/news/badlands-national-park-twitter-goes-rogue-starts-tweeting-facts-about-the-environment/

71716577669550080 (2017-01-25T03:30:07.608000+00:00) : arms has the most donors but it's still losing

71716577669550080 (2017-01-25T03:29:02.637000+00:00) : it's all about which community is the richest

71716577669550080 (2017-01-25T03:16:15.509000+00:00) : it's going to be real hard for arms to win considering it isn't released yet and these other games have actual competitive scenes
71716577669550080 (2017-01-25T03:15:52.938000+00:00) : aw man pokken and killer instinct are beating it now

71716577669550080 (2017-01-23T05:44:15.688000+00:00) : there are some actual good players going to this
71716577669550080 (2017-01-23T05:44:03.955000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-01-23T05:42:17.768000+00:00) : shit at one of the biggest smash majors they just ran an ad for IU bloomington smash tourney

71716577669550080 (2017-01-22T18:44:46.855000+00:00) : wtf you can pull the ancients with rubick lift
71716577669550080 (2017-01-22T01:29:42.190000+00:00) : <@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362> dota?
71716577669550080 (2017-01-22T00:53:57.825000+00:00) : I really hope Lanky Kong is an Arms character
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T23:43:53.960000+00:00) : I thought you said it was garbage
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T23:43:36.054000+00:00) : I do think the switch is Nintendo's most traditional console since the GameCube though
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T23:42:17.910000+00:00) : True but 1-2switch clearly had a higher development cost than something like Wii sports. It's more similar to nintendo land, and the Nintendo land bundle for Wii U was 50 dollars extra. I don't think they could have made a profit off of 1-2 switch if it was free. But I do think they can get away with a free sample of the game that has enough minigames to showcase the system but not enough to where they would lose money on it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T23:35:01.076000+00:00) : But i could see them discounting  12switch a lot or include a free demo with like a third of the minigames or something
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T23:34:04.915000+00:00) : Yeah but you could argue that a) Nintendo doesn't want 12 switch representing the switch like Wii sports represented the Wii. They probably want to keep it marketed as a more "typical/hardcore" console which is why all their marketing has been with Zelda. And b) if it were bundled the cost of the system would be higher and not a lot of people want to pay extra for a system if they don't want that game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T23:30:55.421000+00:00) : 12 switch is really weird because it's too simple for the hardcore audience and too expensive for the casual audience who doesn't know anything about games. So it's unclear who it is marketed to besides the obvious party-goers
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T23:23:14.018000+00:00) : The 1 2 switch is Nintendo's undercover drinking game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T23:18:26.745000+00:00) : Both the classic and the switch had/will have very high demand
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T23:17:39.840000+00:00) : I don't understand why they didn't get nes classic either
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T23:13:25.040000+00:00) : Also is gameworld not getting any?
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T23:13:11.856000+00:00) : I think as long as you go to stores early enough. Dont they have to reserve some stock for non-preorders?
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T23:09:10.017000+00:00) : Unless you can rent it from gameworld
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T23:08:42.528000+00:00) : Why. In the only one who will have one and I won't even have 1 2 switch
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T22:51:55.990000+00:00) : It's actually the same day Logan comes out
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T22:51:47.170000+00:00) : Yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T22:40:33.303000+00:00) : They should make a Malo spin off game where you play as Malo and try to grow your shop empire

71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T21:47:22.018000+00:00) : Baby is very motivated to expand his franchise

71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T18:20:35.906000+00:00) : I feel like most people become dicks when they get rich and famous
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T18:12:47.133000+00:00) : it requires 256 megs
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T18:12:42.810000+00:00) : maybe you dont have enough ram
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T18:12:06.095000+00:00) : 96% positive
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T18:11:57.514000+00:00) : no it isnt
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T18:11:38.002000+00:00) : im pretty sure it gets cheaper than that on steam even
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T18:09:35.308000+00:00) : because all the good deals are on ps3
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T18:09:19.534000+00:00) : that sucks
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T18:09:08.025000+00:00) : can you buy those ps3 games on ps4?
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T18:08:18.809000+00:00) : ah yes goat simulator for only 4 dollars. what a steal
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T01:06:14.090000+00:00) : and you dont want to look *that* dumb in front of your professor
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T01:06:03.023000+00:00) : well otherwise you would have to pretend you dont know anything about minecraft or its mods
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T00:25:51.210000+00:00) : but it was physical labor or something, not minecraft mods
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T00:24:41.222000+00:00) : and miss gouker

71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T00:22:33.073000+00:00) : i would just do that for free. seems weird to get paid by your professor to install minecraft mods
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T00:21:47.763000+00:00) : he deserves some credit for that
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T00:21:37.704000+00:00) : well he clearly made the correct assumption
71716577669550080 (2017-01-21T00:13:08.215000+00:00) : wehat do you even say ronald

71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T03:49:56.995000+00:00) : the fantasy plays a large role
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T03:48:43.654000+00:00) : but the show isnt just about politics
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T03:48:31.843000+00:00) : alright cool but remember ronald just doesnt think it belongs in a show about politics
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T03:46:38.830000+00:00) : also asher just because you personally dont like the fantasy in got doesnt mean that it's not one of the main focuses of the show
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T03:44:51.888000+00:00) : no one cares about your opinion
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T03:44:46.404000+00:00) : now it's just opinion
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T03:44:42.572000+00:00) : you guys are deviating from ronalds point

71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T03:40:56.411000+00:00) : ronald you're just describing house of cards
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T03:40:28.005000+00:00) : yeah and the growing threat of white walkers and dragons

71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T03:37:22.779000+00:00) : and for 5 of those seasons the dragons were fucking babies
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T03:37:12.215000+00:00) : theyve destroyed like 3 cities

71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T03:31:02.276000+00:00) : the only purpose they serve is to destroy shit and add to the lore
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T03:30:48.223000+00:00) : and not many people know about the 3 living ones
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T03:30:25.984000+00:00) : ronald the whole point of dragons in that show is that people think they are all extinct
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T03:28:40.890000+00:00) : also the whole thing is fantasy anyway, dragons are a main theme

71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T02:48:40.710000+00:00) : should have stuck with the firefighter motif
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T02:30:30.723000+00:00) : i dont know if it really fits her lore. i thought she was a firefighter
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T02:27:45.414000+00:00) : https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/821900007649329153

71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T02:01:47.813000+00:00) : they are on mobile so ronald could have plakyed them
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T01:22:59.720000+00:00) : it's always cool when indie games get physical releases
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T01:22:07.859000+00:00) : wow thats pretty cool the binding of isaac afterbirth+ is getting a physical retail game release on switch
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T01:15:37.524000+00:00) : "ahh here's the problem. too many toasters!"
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:57:11.136000+00:00) : sounds like a really hard gamet to make
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:49:38.151000+00:00) : it's awesome
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:49:30.379000+00:00) : their prime discount has really helped me out these past couple of days
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:46:46.209000+00:00) : did you do it at amazon
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:21:45.520000+00:00) : <:ronnieboy:232336989989371904>
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:19:56.406000+00:00) : ........
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:19:37.945000+00:00) : ....
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:18:09.305000+00:00) : but maybe he would like arms
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:17:54.704000+00:00) : i know but its going to be a while before it gets all the games that he brother wants such as smash
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:16:43.689000+00:00) : keenan i feel like we should make a console buying guide for ronald. im worried hes not the most educated consumer here
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:14:09.804000+00:00) : and use for two-player
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:14:06.515000+00:00) : the little ones on the sides that you can take off
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:13:58.384000+00:00) : the switch controllers
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:11:13.093000+00:00) : whats more likely is the vive and oculus will just adopt the hd rumble into their controllers
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:09:21.736000+00:00) : not only will you be milking cows but you'll be immersed
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:08:57.306000+00:00) : ronald i dont know if you realize but the switch controllers have really advanced haptic feedback so it actually feels like you're milking an udder
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:08:08.512000+00:00) : that kind of shit is literally what nintendo does
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:07:37.705000+00:00) : but the customization features in that are far more robust than what weve seen with existing miis so it could be a sign of stuff to come for the new miis
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:06:52.441000+00:00) : also the miitomo smart phone app is literally all about miis
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:06:26.463000+00:00) : yeah there's footage
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:06:14.160000+00:00) : no they arent, there are some in mario kart
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:05:20.965000+00:00) : instead of bowling you are milking cows
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:04:59.590000+00:00) : 1 2 switch is basically the same thing but weirder
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:04:37.017000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:04:09.154000+00:00) : it's not getting mario kart for example until april
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:04:02.539000+00:00) : yeah but does your brother want to play any of the launch games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:02:37.168000+00:00) : or a bunch of indie games that you can get on steam
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:02:17.057000+00:00) : or just dance or skylanders
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:01:44.026000+00:00) : also ronald there's no reason to get a switch day one unless you want to play bomberman, snipperclips, 1 2 switch, or zelda
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:01:12.421000+00:00) : and i think most stores only have a certain pre-order allotment
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:00:36.455000+00:00) : well they are shipping 2 million consoles in the first month
71716577669550080 (2017-01-19T00:00:05.534000+00:00) : occasionaly shit still opens up
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:59:57.721000+00:00) : you have to be on the lookout
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:59:25.273000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:59:19.666000+00:00) : motion controls are really good for aiming fps games so they ahve to be high quality
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:58:52.648000+00:00) : yeah its vastly improved
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:58:46.139000+00:00) : thats the key
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:58:40.845000+00:00) : its more of a hybrid portable-console
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:57:45.643000+00:00) : i wouldnt really compare it with the wii. they dont emphasize the motion controls like they did with the wii but still include them for the option
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:53:01.930000+00:00) : yes
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:33:07.709000+00:00) : you're so immature
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:33:04.698000+00:00) : no wonder you play nintendo consoles
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:30:50.231000+00:00) : i dont know what you would do about the password to bypass it though
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:30:32.272000+00:00) : yeah i guess you could put it on yourself
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:30:26.629000+00:00) : oh
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:29:52.752000+00:00) : what
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:28:23.505000+00:00) : i love all these bowser parental controls memes
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:26:44.115000+00:00) : noo the ps4 owner just isnt trying hard enough
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:25:42.909000+00:00) : https://i.redditmedia.com/rpzK1NMiPwPL4N4ox2-dJdXUpEWCMR8RXJQg-ks9DbI.jpg?w=850&s=0f526a6f85d7210fc128b89b4f54f46e
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:22:04.995000+00:00) : yeah because you're like 9
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:21:09.180000+00:00) : Last week: Reggie: "Dont worry we haven't forgotten about out other IPs". This week: Announces 4 new fire emblem games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:19:35.077000+00:00) : now, i dont see i a use personally unless im importing from europe when they get something first
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:19:11.094000+00:00) : when they announced the switch was region free i would have been excited 7 years ago
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:18:40.790000+00:00) : and was pissed that the ds was region locked
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:18:31.766000+00:00) : i remember when black and white came out i was super pissed that japan got it so much sooner
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:18:14.380000+00:00) : but they do global releases so that doesnt matter anymore
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:18:06.963000+00:00) : the only games i could possibly play imported from japan are pokemon games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:17:32.098000+00:00) : yeah but wouldnt they be in japanese
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:17:05.072000+00:00) : just novelty
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:17:02.571000+00:00) : whats the point
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:16:56.995000+00:00) : oh super famicom
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:16:52.730000+00:00) : sf?
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:16:31.318000+00:00) : asher might like it though
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:15:41.617000+00:00) : it feels like one of those games i cant appreciate without having played either smt or fe
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:14:33.846000+00:00) : ive heard of it and heard it was good but i never realied it was a fe/smt crossover
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:14:17.996000+00:00) : yea
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:13:45.527000+00:00) : wtf i just realized there;s a fire emblem x shin megami tensei game for wii u and it actually has very high ratings
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:11:26.964000+00:00) : different artists drew different dudes
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:11:15.483000+00:00) : anyway at least fire emblem mobile is coming to android first. it has cool artwork
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:09:25+00:00) : it's practically a nintendo select
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:09:18.894000+00:00) : nah dude nintendo puts it officially on sale for 20 pretty often
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:08:48.291000+00:00) : dude
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:08:04.994000+00:00) : also it has a killer soundtrack
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:07:54.771000+00:00) : it's probably relatively cheap now for a 3-4 year old game and one of the best ones
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:07:34.509000+00:00) : well if i ever got into fire emblem i would start with awakening
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:07:03.552000+00:00) : like main protagonists
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:06:55.680000+00:00) : lol why do you think there is such a huge cast of "famous" fire emblem heroes
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:06:09.811000+00:00) : but i meant that in a broad sense, the gameplay of both series stays teh same and what changes is what people care about so they keep playing them
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:05:29.582000+00:00) : they play it for the pokemon
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:05:24.842000+00:00) : i didnt mean people play pokemon for the lore
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:04:48.826000+00:00) : they might not offer very unique gameplay but it's the same reason people keep playing pokemon games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:04:31.136000+00:00) : i mean i think if you're realy into the lore they would be worth playing
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:03:48.614000+00:00) : yeah they are good
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:02:32.274000+00:00) : which one
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:01:01.448000+00:00) : like sega might be doing with sonic
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:00:56.482000+00:00) : they arent just mass producing shit fire emblems
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T23:00:39.569000+00:00) : well the first two 3ds fire emblems had pretty high ratings
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:59:47.853000+00:00) : i mean like original titles
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:59:41.508000+00:00) : oras is a remake
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:59:34.066000+00:00) : like the second most popular game franchise ever
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:59:27.140000+00:00) : and also keenan it's fucking pokemon
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:59:14.030000+00:00) : no pokemon has 2
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:58:54.038000+00:00) : fucking crazy
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:58:49.501000+00:00) : not remakes or ports
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:58:40.651000+00:00) : can you believe the 3ds is going to have three (3!!!) mainline fire emblem games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:57:10.851000+00:00) : well i guess i play mother
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:57:02.549000+00:00) : i think it would depress me to play a series that isnt being continued
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:56:33.040000+00:00) : i dont have it on gameboy so id have to get it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:56:23.668000+00:00) : no but ive been wanting to for a while
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:55:08.965000+00:00) : yeah the tactics and the battle system are what intrigues me most
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:53:26.628000+00:00) : i didnt realize how anime it all is. not that it's a bad thing, just when i played fire emblem on gameboy it wasnt advanced enough at the technical level to have all the voice acting and animated cutscenes that it does now
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:52:43.974000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:51:52.009000+00:00) : i just want to figure out why it's such a popular jrpg
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:48:59.606000+00:00) : i wish i was more into fire emblem so i could be excited for this
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:47:47.752000+00:00) : i get that it's popular in japan but can it really be more popular than some of their other IPs in the west
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T22:46:30.717000+00:00) : why is nintendo making like 83 new fire emblem games but it takes like 5 years for an animal crossing game and like 7 for a metroid
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:13:25.180000+00:00) : like he might know about some warping glitch but not be good enough at the game to replicate it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:13:03.766000+00:00) : usually the creators know everything about what they create
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:12:54.430000+00:00) : well you do have a point
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:12:05.751000+00:00) : he just plays it enough to make sure it's fun and stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:11:58.781000+00:00) : there are other people to do that hardcore bug fixing
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:11:42.551000+00:00) : yeah but my point is he probably spends more time designing the game than extensively playing it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:11:11.137000+00:00) : not some programmer or speedrunner
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:10:58.619000+00:00) : he's an artist by training
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:10:48.580000+00:00) : probably not very good
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:10:05.323000+00:00) : you never know
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:10:01.634000+00:00) : maybe it's just to be really good at mario 64
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:09:55.210000+00:00) : whats the meaning of life anyway
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:09:50.767000+00:00) : i mean it's a good psa for someone out there
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:07:47.836000+00:00) : woo
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:07:46.183000+00:00) : so i guess it serves a purpose on a micro level
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:07:35.484000+00:00) : it just doesnt benefit anyone except the people who also want to learn from him or those who find joy in casually watching his stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:07:12.258000+00:00) : like this type of analytical skills and precision skills this mario 64 has are very valuable and he's really exercising them here
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:05:02.140000+00:00) : i think they are a good brain strengthening activity but of course there are probably better things you could do. but no matter what you are doing there will always be some better option so it's pointless to think about it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:03:51.103000+00:00) : because video games are more engaging which i think is better for the mind
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:03:09.236000+00:00) : but no one ever is the most efficient with their time
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:02:53.763000+00:00) : i dont really think video games are a waste of time, just maybe not the best use of it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:01:12.935000+00:00) : i know im just saying what i think makes it interesting
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:00:26.094000+00:00) : so it's fun to watch for the cleverness
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T02:00:08.860000+00:00) : people who do these kinds of things are obviously very intelligent, they just arent putting those skills towards a practical use
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T01:46:50.885000+00:00) : ive never seen it before
71716577669550080 (2017-01-18T01:45:48.193000+00:00) : da fuck

71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T06:26:17.078000+00:00) : yo keenan you should play the metal gear hack and slash by platinum
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:57:21.300000+00:00) : otherwise you would be a criminal
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:57:16.376000+00:00) : you'd better
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:56:44.884000+00:00) : thats so mean

71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:49:05.828000+00:00) : for some reason dota keeps crashing as soon as i launch it, so im going to restart steam
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:39:11.248000+00:00) : sure
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:33:11.966000+00:00) : it's an ultrabeast
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:33:08.184000+00:00) : this isnt a normal pokemon
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:32:22.443000+00:00) : no keenan that makes perfect sense
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:28:36.035000+00:00) : especially the lusamine music
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:28:30.998000+00:00) : yeah that part is super cool
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:26:33.769000+00:00) : did you already catch nebby
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:24:05.578000+00:00) : perhaps
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:15:22.235000+00:00) : the two options they could do wouldnt take much dev time compared to sun and moon
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:15:08.197000+00:00) : eh
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:14:35.032000+00:00) : which is before mario
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:14:31.002000+00:00) : pokemon usually comes in fall
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:14:18.203000+00:00) : or pokemon
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:13:58.132000+00:00) : skyward sword is pretty amazing
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:13:46.512000+00:00) : lol

71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:11:40.619000+00:00) : i love the zelda light blasting the guardian gif so much
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:10:34.590000+00:00) : i can just play it next time i come over or something
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:10:18.625000+00:00) : because i dont want to borrow one thing without returning the other
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:09:09.751000+00:00) : i should probably do that first
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:09:06.057000+00:00) : i havent even touched chibi robo yet
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:08:56.493000+00:00) : maybe
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:08:05.403000+00:00) : make stuff more realistic ragdoll-like physics
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:07:47.179000+00:00) : i know team ico likes to do that in their games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:07:21.487000+00:00) : and it's hard to aim my climbing
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:07:16.551000+00:00) : like horse steering is really hard
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:07:11.539000+00:00) : i think the emulator makes the game way harder. the controls seem really imprecise but idk if thats what the game is supposed to be like or not
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:06:34.738000+00:00) : but you have to get to the fourth boy for me

71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T03:03:04.746000+00:00) : nick robinson cant stop talking about the switch on twitter
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T02:55:56.743000+00:00) : wtf there's a ratchet and clank show
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T02:52:48.738000+00:00) : emulator is not the ideal experience for this game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T02:08:24.409000+00:00) : idk that aether foundation twist was pretty crazy and unexpected
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T02:07:12.245000+00:00) : ah
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T02:06:56.042000+00:00) : what ending
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T02:03:47.070000+00:00) : there's no point especially if all xbox one exclusives can also be played on pc
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T02:03:33.680000+00:00) : i feel like they should really stop making consoles
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T02:03:15.681000+00:00) : but i guess they never really did that well compared to everyone else
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T02:03:04.301000+00:00) : i always thought that was the one gen where microsoft did well
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T02:02:14.466000+00:00) : yeah i just looked at it for some reason i though the xbox sold a lot more than the ps3
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T02:01:38.141000+00:00) : i meant comparative to the other consoles in their gens
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T02:00:15.736000+00:00) : ya
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T02:00:02.791000+00:00) : i feel like it's like the gamecube, not a lot of people bought it but it has a really good game library
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T01:58:27.286000+00:00) : wow this metal gear really is a system seller
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T01:55:00.641000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T01:25:50.630000+00:00) : asher i want to play defense boys too
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T01:23:03.288000+00:00) : like stealth boys or over boys
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T01:22:44.602000+00:00) : we should play some games later
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T01:10:17.960000+00:00) : such as pocket monsters lunar
71716577669550080 (2017-01-17T01:09:59.267000+00:00) : now you should play some actual good games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-16T22:50:17.245000+00:00) : does anyone want to play dota <@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362>
71716577669550080 (2017-01-16T13:55:56.482000+00:00) : So it looks like the team behind octopath traveler is the same as the bravely series
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T07:32:56.609000+00:00) : this needs to be in a real game

71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:22:34.419000+00:00) : i believe it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:19:31.702000+00:00) : so really it must be just the technical different then
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:19:18.942000+00:00) : i mean with the same zelda style
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:19:13.484000+00:00) : oh well link to the past and oot are actually pretty similar
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:18:31.327000+00:00) : because the first two zelda games are pretty different from the rest
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:18:11.162000+00:00) : aside the fact that the solid games are 3d
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:18:04.010000+00:00) : how different are they from the solid games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:17:58.150000+00:00) : but gameplay wise
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:17:39.863000+00:00) : oh ok
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:16:16.618000+00:00) : its probably like loz and loz the aventure of link, which had some core elements of the other loz games but where created really before any of the main lore or characteristics were established
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:15:17.227000+00:00) : i dont know how important the non solid ones are to the series
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:14:12.819000+00:00) : snakes revenge: "A sequel to the NES version of Metal Gear developed for the western market without the involvement of Hideo Kojima. It is non-canon to the mainline Metal Gear series."
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:14:01.863000+00:00) : metal gear: the NES version features several changes from the MSX2 original,[61] and it is not considered part of the Metal Gear canon by series creator Hideo Kojima[4]
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:13:13.672000+00:00) : and then theres metal gear -nes and and snake's revenge after that also for nes
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:12:49.535000+00:00) : so theres metal gear - msx2, and metal gear 2 - msx2
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:11:42.681000+00:00) : they were developed without kojima
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:11:28.834000+00:00) : not according to this page
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:11:09.055000+00:00) : and mg1 and mg2 are only on msx2 and smart phones and wii ware
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:10:56.545000+00:00) : so the NES spinoffs of the non-solid first two metal gear games are not considered canon
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:08:23.604000+00:00) : so the order is like 3, pw, 5, 1, 2, 4
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:07:38.423000+00:00) : and then mgs 5 was a sequal to peace walker
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:07:26.808000+00:00) : mgs peace walker was a sequel to mgs3
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:07:08.273000+00:00) : mgs3 was a prequel
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:07:03.079000+00:00) : the story goes mgs1, mgs2, mgs4
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:06:48.920000+00:00) : ok so basically
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:04:16.764000+00:00) : jesus christ even the zelda series is more straightforward than this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Metal_Gear_media
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:01:19.457000+00:00) : the wikipedia seems to say it's only a remake of mgs1
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:01:10.559000+00:00) : so does mgs: the twin snakes have just mgs 1 or mgs 1 and 2
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T04:00:55.880000+00:00) : im so confused by all the mgs versions

71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T03:56:48.165000+00:00) : just gamecube and hd?
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T03:56:43.250000+00:00) : how many remasters of mgs are there

71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T03:52:26.551000+00:00) : sometimes they are like digging throuhg blocks like terraria or somthing and other times they are jetpacking in the air
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T03:52:08.155000+00:00) : i dont understand metroid at all
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T03:50:40.046000+00:00) : wow Toby Fox just donated 10,000 dollars towards the undertale run
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T03:49:58.851000+00:00) : all about these three legendary heroes who were called out of retirement on a quest to bring the king's daughters to school
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T03:49:22.031000+00:00) : its a strategy based rogue-like that looks really fast paced

71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T03:44:17.165000+00:00) : or maybe they just dont make the distinction when theres only really one popular way to do it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T03:44:02.519000+00:00) : then wouldnt it say glitchless
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T03:43:45.456000+00:00) : idk if that means glitches or not
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T03:43:35.387000+00:00) : no 100%
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T03:42:59.753000+00:00) : its hard to watch this because there are 4 different people to watch and i dont understand metroid that much

71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T03:28:13.221000+00:00) : people have described it as feeling like you're jerking someone off, not just in the gameplay but in the hd rumble
71716577669550080 (2017-01-15T03:27:31.776000+00:00) : i hope youve seen videos of the milk game

71716577669550080 (2017-01-13T03:31:25.745000+00:00) : ugh the stream is playing the trailer sounds
71716577669550080 (2017-01-13T02:58:09.201000+00:00) : lol maybe i should unmute this chat
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:19:35.723000+00:00) : they are all beautiful in their own ways
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:19:27.800000+00:00) : i dont like critiquing games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:19:14.439000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:18:45.870000+00:00) : and they are all plagued by dated mechanics and some design flaws
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:18:30.921000+00:00) : and they are all plagued by dated mechanics and some design flaws
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:18:19.250000+00:00) : and they are all plagued by dated mechanics and some design flaws
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:17:28.939000+00:00) : yeah but all the old collectable games have those things
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:15:37.811000+00:00) : You have to be some kind of ♥♥♥♥ing stupid to design that Psycrow boss fight.
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:15:21.096000+00:00) : Bland, uninspired 3D platformer similar to Banjo-Kazooie, and by that I mean it's more or less a complete and utter ripoff. The platforming stages are decent enough but the boss fights are ATROCIOUS: you and your opponent duke it out in an exciting contest of... collecting orbs scattered about in the arena. With really awkward controls, the boss constantly shooting you causing you to drop your orbs, and the fact that you still have your health to worry about (whilst the boss can take as many shots they want without even caring) all combine to create a really unpleasant experience.
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:15:05.770000+00:00) : Could very well be one of the worst games ever made. Gameplay, controls, camera angles, plot....everything. This game is to the Earthworm Jim saga is what the first Hulk movie was to the marvel movies.....best be forgotten.
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:14:54.326000+00:00) : apparently just the music files are missing but that can be fixed
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:14:41.260000+00:00) : lol the reviews are funny
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:12:57.597000+00:00) : and also not the best game on top of that
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:12:45.183000+00:00) : looks like it might be a bad port
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:12:17.602000+00:00) : i wonder why it only has 55% positive
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:10:36.577000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:09:30.017000+00:00) : earthworm jim 3d
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:09:09.776000+00:00) : i think it's on pc too
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:03:09.596000+00:00) : also super mario 3d world is basically a collection game except with a time limit, and a linear level structure
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:01:32.765000+00:00) : ive started sunshine just havent gotten around to really playing it through yet
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:00:40.471000+00:00) : shit i never made that connection before
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:00:34.431000+00:00) : makes sense because it was made by the same people
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T18:00:11.523000+00:00) : it was literally a collectable game except a racer instead of a platformer
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:59:56.564000+00:00) : actually i think thats why i liked diddy kong racing so much
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:59:16.370000+00:00) : which is basically yookalaylee
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:59:10.787000+00:00) : if they made remakes or refreshed them with modern mechanics  would definitely play
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:58:44.868000+00:00) : but im really looking forward to yooka laylee though
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:58:35.353000+00:00) : they just seem kind of dated for me
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:58:20.339000+00:00) : why is also why im pretty sure i would really like those old n64 collecting games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:57:49.424000+00:00) : i like looking at the levels in detail and trying to find secrets
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:57:30.859000+00:00) : no i understand that but i treat mario like an exploration game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:56:52.825000+00:00) : but then how can you sightsee
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:56:13.388000+00:00) : which is why i dont understand how you can play the new mario games without getting the coins
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:55:40.417000+00:00) : i can get 60 hours out of mario be a) being bad and b) trying to get at least 60-70% of the collectables
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:54:41.331000+00:00) : i do that sort of with majoras mask, use a walkthrough to make sure im being hte most effecient with my time. but i still do my own puzzle solving and boss fighting and whatever because thats the fun part. and unlike long plays on youtube, walkthroughs dont spoil story or cutscenes
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:34:19.917000+00:00) : also they have a lot of replayability
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:34:05.806000+00:00) : i mean the mario games are short but only if you're good. since i suck they take a lot longer
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:29:58.592000+00:00) : it could be a 10 hour campaign as long as it somehow has 50 more hours of additional content
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:28:22.394000+00:00) : i cant justify that price
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:27:11.366000+00:00) : yeah exactly
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:26:52.372000+00:00) : only if im paying 10 dollars for them
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:26:11.499000+00:00) : as you've made abundantly clear
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:25:16.298000+00:00) : same reason im excited to start a bunch of new games without finishing stuff first
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:24:51.577000+00:00) : people are usually more motivated to play new stuff rather than finish the old stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:13:18.924000+00:00) : basic math
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T17:12:58.944000+00:00) : yeah because one is a 10 hour game and the other is a 40 hour game that you spend 100 hours on
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T04:02:32.764000+00:00) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnX42OHnuLA
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:40:19.499000+00:00) : not everything fits perfectly
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:40:13.430000+00:00) : sure but theres no better category to put those games in
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:36:40.790000+00:00) : technically clash of clans and those games are the most popular rts games right now
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:36:26.724000+00:00) : i dont think pvp is what defines an rts
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:36:01.747000+00:00) : there is in pikmin 3
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:35:14.617000+00:00) : neat
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:34:53.547000+00:00) : and halo wars 2
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:34:47.899000+00:00) : which is why games like pikmin change the rts genre
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:33:28.881000+00:00) : those are the only ompetitive rtses but not the only ones
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:32:02.938000+00:00) : but you can probably speed run it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:31:58.413000+00:00) : which isnt competitive
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:31:43.435000+00:00) : and pikmin
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:30:23.319000+00:00) : yeah i'll keep up with too i guess, seems intriguing
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:29:00.167000+00:00) : i dont know how any rtses work with a controller besides pikmin
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:28:38.889000+00:00) : but if it's slower paced and has that combat system it could work with a controller i guess but idk how
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:28:08.276000+00:00) : which means it has to be mouse keyboard like a traditional rts
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:27:16.771000+00:00) : well it will also be on pc
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:26:50.727000+00:00) : and the building
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:26:43.668000+00:00) : i like the civs
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:26:33.289000+00:00) : what do we like about aoe
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:25:23.872000+00:00) : no one liked aoe3
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:25:04.822000+00:00) : sounds like p2w
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:24:44.298000+00:00) : so is it turn based or what
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:23:25.119000+00:00) : im sure i would
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:23:01.496000+00:00) : i dont really know how aoe and starcraft compare but whatever
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:22:39.998000+00:00) : so aoe but with halo skin
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:22:24.812000+00:00) : what was halo wars 1 like
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:21:50.056000+00:00) : oh nvm thats the rts one
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:21:26.281000+00:00) : what about it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:17:32.089000+00:00) : no the next fire emblem is just going to be a moba but when you die you are permanently out of the remaining 45 minute long game
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:15:43.164000+00:00) : except for fire emblem (yet)
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:13:54.620000+00:00) : intelligent systems has this weird habit recently of suddenly chaning the formula for all their games that have a formula proven to work
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:13:31.519000+00:00) : yeah you're right the last warioware was like 2009. i was thinking of game and wario but i guess thats not warioware
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:11:36.964000+00:00) : there needs to be a wario ware for mobile devices because it's the best platform for it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:10:15.167000+00:00) : but they are still making warioware games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:10:07.754000+00:00) : that would be fun
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:09:30.694000+00:00) : we all know how much the market is just craving an ice climbers sequal
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:08:53.790000+00:00) : we could make ice climbers
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:08:39.356000+00:00) : or
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:08:05.109000+00:00) : give a story mode
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:07:49.712000+00:00) : a new game hasnt come out in years
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:07:44.434000+00:00) : there's so much potential for a spiritual bomberman successor
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:07:15.755000+00:00) : please
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:07:11.791000+00:00) : can we just make bomberman
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:07:06.391000+00:00) : shit
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:06:18.344000+00:00) : i feel like tons of minesqeeper remakes have been tried
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:06:05.944000+00:00) : also studying game design is a lot different from normal computer science because you focus on learning the popular engines like unity and unreal which take a lot of experience and isn't like normal code
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:04:27.364000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:04:12.025000+00:00) : no but with a game design degree they might not make indie games but just get hired from some other company
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:03:04.912000+00:00) : well to be fair you never hear about 99% of games that are created
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:01:43.038000+00:00) : ya
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:01:14.689000+00:00) : or is it only serious game design major
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:00:55.059000+00:00) : ronald does unc have a game design major
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T03:00:05.748000+00:00) : Serious games: from Pokemon Go to Black Ops 3 in 1 semester
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:58:33.484000+00:00) : thats what that class turns you into ronald
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:58:25.383000+00:00) : yeah he seemed pretty serious
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:56:45.301000+00:00) : what are you taking this semester? oh im just taking honors serious games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:55:55.288000+00:00) : is there a course called "non-serious games" otherwise known as "games"
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:53:53.984000+00:00) : to the outside audience
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:53:46.733000+00:00) : for some reason i dont think you'll actually be making "serious" games. it seems like just a facade to make a normal game dev course seem more legit
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:52:08.610000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:51:41.121000+00:00) : what aspect triggers you
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:51:20.642000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:50:54.191000+00:00) : "Finally, if people are going to play games, perhaps we can give them some games with
additional value beyond entertainment (think classics vs. romance novels)."
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:49:38.623000+00:00) : "Serious Games" lol
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:48:58.077000+00:00) : i would try it
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:48:04.721000+00:00) : keenan maybe next semeseter i'll have a free slot idk
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:47:07.042000+00:00) : why is it hard to get into
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:46:44.757000+00:00) : which isn't coding
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:46:35.585000+00:00) : you would probably be learning the unity or something
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:46:11.149000+00:00) : it would be fun but it's probably not a lot of coding
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:45:24.694000+00:00) : ez
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:44:56.972000+00:00) : like how early
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:43:08.392000+00:00) : grapefruit is my least favorite flavor
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T02:42:04.394000+00:00) : that is true
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T01:47:38.354000+00:00) : wtf i just realized we have a 3 day weekend already
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T00:29:14.921000+00:00) : 👍
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T00:13:13.985000+00:00) : its not that i dont care about the plot it's just that i need to go through it more than once to completely understand it. but most games only play the cutscene once
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T00:11:07.214000+00:00) : yeah and sometimes i find it hard to focus completely on the plot
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T00:08:40.572000+00:00) : yeah i do
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T00:08:23.252000+00:00) : yeah which is cool
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T00:07:01.283000+00:00) : it's why i tend to like newer games because they always have the latest and greatest production value
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T00:06:23.348000+00:00) : if it's animated well thats fine but it's more about how it's integrated into the overall game and its feel
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T00:04:47.856000+00:00) : it's cool but i mean in games the overall quality of the production value is what interests me. so like how the cutscene is integrated with the rest of the gameplay and music and level design
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T00:03:22.820000+00:00) : i appreciate cool technical stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T00:03:09.781000+00:00) : any game can have a good story but not all games have cool cutscenes
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T00:02:47.320000+00:00) : because design and programming is basically that
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T00:01:34.851000+00:00) : if they played them a second time, i would watch again for the story
71716577669550080 (2017-01-11T00:01:15.010000+00:00) : im serious ctuscenes fascinate me in every way except for the story part
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T23:58:43.319000+00:00) : you get to see camera angles that you normally dont get to see
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T23:57:41.255000+00:00) : whenever i watch a cutscene i am too engrossed by the technical aspects of it like the camera and music and voices to pay attention to what it says
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T23:56:06.380000+00:00) : i wish games replayed cutscenes
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T23:03:53.960000+00:00) : like my Q101 professor studied history and the philosophy of science, animal behavior, and machine morality
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T23:02:13.103000+00:00) : you dont see professors who say they study "cognitive science", you say you study what psecifically you do in cog sci such as computational neuroscience, or cognitive neuroscience, or human evolution, or language development, artificial intelligence, or whatever
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T23:00:01.017000+00:00) : whereas cog sci is interdisciplinary and covers psych, neuroscience, comp sci, linguistics, antropology, etc... basically all aspects of the brain. so how it evolved, it's structure, how people learn, and how people think and behave (and the last part is basically psych)
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T22:58:27.360000+00:00) : psych is pretty focused
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T22:58:11.870000+00:00) : psych is more the study of the mind and its functions, and it's most about how the mind and mental attitudes affects behavior
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T22:57:32.891000+00:00) : cog sci is more the study of thought and learning, basically the study of intelligence (And anything connected to intelligence
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:12:42.139000+00:00) : because i have too much to fit in
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:12:33.349000+00:00) : because i almost never take optional stuff
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:12:28.314000+00:00) : which says something
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:12:21.404000+00:00) : i took it even though it's optional for majors
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:12:15.047000+00:00) : it's a really interesting class
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:11:24.058000+00:00) : very little exception
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:11:19.808000+00:00) : in comp sci most the ais are indian males
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:10:37.803000+00:00) : most of my ais have been dudes
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:09:36.850000+00:00) : cog sci doesn thavve uis
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:09:32.900000+00:00) : i mean ai
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:09:27.897000+00:00) : im sure shes the most attractive cog sci ui
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:08:56.931000+00:00) : probably
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:08:16.242000+00:00) : i also skipped like half of the lab sections which werent mandatory
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:07:58.157000+00:00) : so thats good
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:07:52.586000+00:00) : and gave me good grades
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:07:49.460000+00:00) : she graded all my stuff though
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:07:44.913000+00:00) : she is although i never really interacted with her much
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:07:10.175000+00:00) : see was my ai last sem for a class
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:06:45.097000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T21:06:43.204000+00:00) : for me q101 was a fascinating class so you might want to pay attention anyway
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T20:53:26.415000+00:00) : but you have a different professor
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T20:53:20.094000+00:00) : when i took it a large part of the class was participation and reading responses
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T20:49:44.585000+00:00) : in the past the grade dist for that class is between 20-35% A
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T20:47:37.329000+00:00) : my class had 60
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T20:45:13.664000+00:00) : it wasnt hard because i paid attention
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T20:44:30.792000+00:00) : its not a hard class
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T20:44:28.265000+00:00) : its also esy to just pay  atenntion
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T20:43:56.091000+00:00) : i cant tutor people who dont pay attention
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T14:06:22.198000+00:00) : keenan you should get into katamari speedrunning
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T01:42:13.852000+00:00) : damn right it does
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T01:11:07.993000+00:00) : isnt 5?
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T01:11:02.891000+00:00) : i wasnt sure
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T01:09:47.351000+00:00) : is that mgs a fps
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T00:52:05.012000+00:00) : they even kept them for the 3ds version
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T00:51:28.769000+00:00) : i thought the great fairies were
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T00:51:20.070000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T00:02:52.324000+00:00) : it'e weird to speed run a game with so many other ocmpetitive aspects
71716577669550080 (2017-01-10T00:02:41.372000+00:00) : if you are going to put this much time into pokemon i dont think it should be speedrunning
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:51:55.810000+00:00) : maybe you just had poor item management
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:50:41.655000+00:00) : cant you buy some
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:50:31.176000+00:00) : also i like emerald because it's one of the few games they speed run that i actually know all the mechanics of
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:50:11.185000+00:00) : why cant you get more hp
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:46:43.261000+00:00) : what boss
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:46:22.307000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:44:05.953000+00:00) : it's a lot of rng
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:41:50.058000+00:00) : i just want to get a gist for the general strats
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:41:42.722000+00:00) : yeah its not the best genre for a speed run
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:39:39.934000+00:00) : i want to see what it's like when there are actual battle mechanics
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:39:28.018000+00:00) : ive never watch a pokemon speed run before outside of gen 1
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:39:16.546000+00:00) : speed run
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:39:14.810000+00:00) : ?
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:37:10.175000+00:00) : pokemon emerald run boys
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:30:57.993000+00:00) : the only reason i dont want to play minecraft right now is that i wont have time for other games
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:17:44.714000+00:00) : monkey ball speedruns are so cool
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:04:34.708000+00:00) : yeah it's just demotivating
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:04:16.653000+00:00) : maybe they can reuse the assets and stuff for something else though
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:04:00.708000+00:00) : it seems like a huge waste of time and resources if that game never launches
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:03:37.070000+00:00) : guys guess what emerald speed run coming soon
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:01:52.382000+00:00) : they could sell them
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:01:46.887000+00:00) : but if you cancel the game what are you going to do with the rights
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T23:00:13.207000+00:00) : i wonder if some other publisher will pick it up if they can
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T22:59:58.909000+00:00) : i feel like scalebound had to be close to being done though
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T22:58:45.945000+00:00) : which is why ps4 has so many more exclusives
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T22:58:34.444000+00:00) : yeah i doubt anyone really wants to work with microsoft
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T22:57:47.048000+00:00) : it will probably have a good soundtrack
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T22:56:51.482000+00:00) : not many open world rpgs are
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T22:56:43.746000+00:00) : it seemed cool that it was 4 player co-op
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T22:55:17.663000+00:00) : i dont even care about the game i just feel bad for the devs
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T22:54:50.332000+00:00) : yea
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T22:54:05.521000+00:00) : their super ambitious game that was 4 years in development just got canceled by microsoft
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T22:50:28.437000+00:00) : its pretty sad what's happening to platinum games right now
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T22:09:21.212000+00:00) : from his website " Fundamentals of formal language theory, computation models and computability, the limits of computability and feasibility"
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T22:09:05.861000+00:00) : and proofs
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T22:08:59.167000+00:00) : im not exactly sure as he hasn't posted the syllabus yet but it's all math
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T21:42:28.030000+00:00) : lol we just spent the first lecture of my computing thoery class on why the imitation game moive is bullshit
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T20:20:22.811000+00:00) : Lol the most I've ever seen is 5%
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T18:26:34.101000+00:00) : attendance cant be that much
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T18:22:20.990000+00:00) : sounds like a joke
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T18:20:43.787000+00:00) : is it a coll-c class
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T18:20:16.180000+00:00) : why do you have to take those classes
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T18:19:21.527000+00:00) : i'll probably just do target since they open the soonest
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T18:17:59.219000+00:00) : so the switch cant be any worse than that
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T18:17:50.829000+00:00) : the wii seems like the hardest
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T18:17:25.118000+00:00) : i didnt get the wii u at launch but i bet it was easy as well due to low demand
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T18:17:04.622000+00:00) : but there was a lot less hype for that
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T18:16:56.929000+00:00) : although at the bloomington gamestop the 3ds was easy to get at launch day
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T18:15:44.939000+00:00) : ugh i think it will be pretty hard to get a switch preorder this week
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T18:14:37.689000+00:00) : american ads just suck though
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T18:14:31.658000+00:00) : japan and europe still have good ads
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T18:14:24.567000+00:00) : pokemon used to have much better marketing than it does now in the u.s.
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T18:14:04.002000+00:00) : he was both, but only president of pokemon USA
71716577669550080 (2017-01-09T18:12:24.221000+00:00) : back when pokemon was good

71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:51:21.437000+00:00) : the only issues i have so far is that some parts are frustratingly difficult. like navigating snowhead trying to collect all the fairies since i kept falling off of platforms, and all the timed sections like the hot spring water that doesnt give you a timer and you have climb that dumb ladder every time it runs out
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:48:40.596000+00:00) : who tried to make excuses for him forgetting the lullaby for his son 😦

71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:37:25.600000+00:00) : especially majora's mask
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:37:18.521000+00:00) : but those games are so draining
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:37:07.564000+00:00) : i really need to finish the zelda series though as my first priority
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:35:29.895000+00:00) : i will
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:34:21.315000+00:00) : it looks like a really good game
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:34:15.134000+00:00) : you guys both have ps4s so you should get dragon quest builders
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:32:34.312000+00:00) : im not sure if others do that too but that seems like a more modern thing
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:32:22.664000+00:00) : like difficulty and encounter rate
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:32:18.365000+00:00) : also the bravely games have settings you can adjust on the fly
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:31:45.340000+00:00) : i feel like i can manage
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:31:13.293000+00:00) : paper mario and the mario rpg's combat system is really cool in its own way
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:30:47.920000+00:00) : yeah which makes me think i should be playing them a lot more than i am
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:27:06.481000+00:00) : i also really like the strategic element of pokemon battles, since it's somethingi can be good at without relying on mechanical skill or timing ability and whatnot
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:17:22.719000+00:00) : i just like how when your people die they die forever
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:17:10.372000+00:00) : but proabbyl because it's more of a strategy game than an rpg
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:16:55.470000+00:00) : ive played fire emblem and i like that
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:13:54.290000+00:00) : i know everything is in terms of story
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:13:49.401000+00:00) : i mean in terms of battle system
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:13:21.807000+00:00) : alright no nothing is better than pokemon
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:12:19.645000+00:00) : the two things i like the most in pokemon are the battles and the story arc (which i know isn't that complex i just like becoming the very best)
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:11:31.746000+00:00) : well im also looking for the turn based battle systems
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:09:38.746000+00:00) : as long as the story is at least as good as pokemon
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:09:24.433000+00:00) : i just want something epic
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:06:42.884000+00:00) : havent played ff either
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:06:27.179000+00:00) : yeah that's what i gather
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:04:02.392000+00:00) : it also has a really good ost
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:02:23.304000+00:00) : i think i would like them
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:00:24.027000+00:00) : that ive never played
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T02:00:19.859000+00:00) : im not saying it's the best im just saying out of all the genres on the 3ds it seems like there are a ton of good jrpg games
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T01:58:40.131000+00:00) : which is like it's strongest suite
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T01:58:29.807000+00:00) : im sort of just realizing now that i really missed out on a lot of the jrpg and rpg library of 3ds
71716577669550080 (2016-12-27T01:57:34.019000+00:00) : well idk if i would want to play them im just wondering

71716577669550080 (2016-12-26T17:21:52.550000+00:00) : On Twitter rtz said he was it was just a joke but idk if the tweet was specifically in reference to that

71716577669550080 (2016-12-23T05:32:24.917000+00:00) : almost as good as the architecture in the last guardian
71716577669550080 (2016-12-23T05:24:36.454000+00:00) : spoilers jesus

71716577669550080 (2016-12-22T23:35:20.460000+00:00) : It's not a fps rpg though
71716577669550080 (2016-12-22T23:33:22.193000+00:00) : I read reviews for a bunch of random stuff

71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T02:36:09.855000+00:00) : which is why i said fourth gen
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T02:36:03.228000+00:00) : i agree with that
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T02:34:48.229000+00:00) : it's just that the earlier games lack some quality of life features thats you may miss if you play one of the newer ones first
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T02:34:16.798000+00:00) : you aren't going to find a bad pokemon game
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T02:34:09.778000+00:00) : they are all good
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T02:34:04.744000+00:00) : ok really an argument could be made for any gen
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T02:33:33.983000+00:00) : nah why
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T02:33:14.411000+00:00) : i recommend platinum
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T02:24:34.540000+00:00) : good because you shouldn't play moon first

71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:46:58.049000+00:00) : can you check in any way
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:44:06.898000+00:00) : which i hope still exist online for your card
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:43:49.486000+00:00) : im also going to have to install drivers
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:42:51.958000+00:00) : if you dont we should make one
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:42:28.472000+00:00) : keenan do you have a microsoft account?
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:42:19.687000+00:00) : i haven't put in a code yet
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:40:57.105000+00:00) : you might be able to tie it to a windows account now though
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:40:37.670000+00:00) : i always forget what you can and cant do
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:40:28.744000+00:00) : yeah i dont mind as long as we can figure out how windows installation works
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:38:48.128000+00:00) : or wii
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:38:44.648000+00:00) : fucking xenoblade on the 3ds
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:38:29.080000+00:00) : like look at all the shit nintendo crams into their tiny disk/cartridge sizes
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:38:14.776000+00:00) : consoles are different though, more compression is required for them
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:37:04.264000+00:00) : i feel like devs could compress their games a lot more if they try, they just dont because they know everyone has tons of space
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:36:19.472000+00:00) : which is the ost ive ever seen for a game
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:36:04.406000+00:00) : the witcher 3 is 65 gigs
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:35:46.325000+00:00) : depends on the game. i also uninstall every game im not using
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:34:59.269000+00:00) : if i installed my entire steam library i dont think it would be 1tb
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:34:28.040000+00:00) : which is all this computer is used for i think
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:34:22.391000+00:00) : i haven't ever heard of anyone filling up 1TB with games yet
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:34:00.394000+00:00) : which is part of the reason he doesnt need space
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:33:40.397000+00:00) : yeah but keenan doesnt need space
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:33:11.555000+00:00) : but im pretty sure you can tie a windows activation to your account now
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:33:02.537000+00:00) : i'd imagine with this hard drive though it will ask to activate windows 10 when i log in
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:32:42.824000+00:00) : do you just want to borrow my hard drive keenan until you get a better one? i dont really care about it. it's like the same brand and model as your old one so it's not going to be any better and i'd recommend getting a new 50 dollar 1 TB one at some point, and whenever you do i can help you install windows and drivers on it
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:30:05.644000+00:00) : alright i have windows installing
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:15:38.791000+00:00) : everything else is literal trash
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:15:25.994000+00:00) : no the best mobile game ever is threes or tilt to live
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:13:53.854000+00:00) : im just saying it's surprisingly fleshed out and you can tell that was nintendo's main idea for content in an otherwise level-limited game
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:13:22.736000+00:00) : you dont have to even get farther in a level than someone to beat them
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:13:11.235000+00:00) : there's a whole plethora of ways to earn points
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:13:03.331000+00:00) : it's not just time trial though
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:11:43.836000+00:00) : but apparently it's multiplayer features are pretty good so maybe if i had a bunch of friends with the game, there would be good competitive incentive to replay stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:10:58.968000+00:00) : i dont every replay stuff in games
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:10:52.621000+00:00) : to be honest, im not even the type of person to like a game like that either
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:10:08.852000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:09:38.450000+00:00) : but they've justified the price in many other ways
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:09:32.252000+00:00) : no of course not but the game isn't just the levels, if it were, then nintendo would be smart enough to put way more levels in to justify the price
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:08:44.491000+00:00) : it's clearly a bait
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:08:33.262000+00:00) : i dont know why you even started this conversation in the first place then, you knew what i was going to say
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:07:42.089000+00:00) : just look at the reviews keenan
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:07:37.431000+00:00) : i've also watched a bunch of gameplay footage of the full version
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:06:42.670000+00:00) : but at least i know what you can do in it
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:06:36.023000+00:00) : i havent played the full version
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:05:41.949000+00:00) : just watch gamexplain's review, they address all the major concerns i personally had with it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w8B2ElzmvI
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:05:22.265000+00:00) : i feel like you dont really understand the full scope of the game
71716577669550080 (2016-12-21T00:03:42.776000+00:00) : and completing challenges

71716577669550080 (2016-12-15T01:40:52.447000+00:00) : i figured that since so many games are mmo, the appeal of them is obvious so i assumed you were explaining the more specifc reasons for mmorpgs

71716577669550080 (2016-12-15T01:33:53.404000+00:00) : i think they are just animated versions of the major cutscenes from each gen

71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T20:50:54.688000+00:00) : like winston and pharah and reaper
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T20:50:48.699000+00:00) : i guess i like the ice themed ones
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T20:49:23.303000+00:00) : i havent looked at that yet

71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T20:41:33.758000+00:00) : probably because you have a pinterest
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T20:40:09.664000+00:00) : polygon images dont work
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T20:12:53.536000+00:00) : link?
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T17:27:42.802000+00:00) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7bPQTpCAt8
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T17:27:12.127000+00:00) : Route 216 in platinum was the best
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T17:23:59.762000+00:00) : yeah the only thing you have to worry about is it's sometimes harder to see other pokemon trainers
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T16:26:20.732000+00:00) : wow Rime is coming to the Switch. I didn't realize that Sony no longer owned it
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T01:16:47.833000+00:00) : ok i might play two then
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T01:14:57.857000+00:00) : ^

71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T01:08:18.435000+00:00) : is it the 10% magic boost
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T01:08:10.294000+00:00) : i dont understand what makes him viable
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T01:05:12.935000+00:00) : i want to do carry tree
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T01:05:06.285000+00:00) : whats new with centaur?

71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T01:02:06.996000+00:00) : ugh i cant decide what hero to play
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T01:01:00.868000+00:00) : if they put a high noon reference in sniper's ult it would be crazy
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T01:00:44.084000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T00:57:35.957000+00:00) : https://twitter.com/EternaLEnVy1991/status/808475397675515904
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T00:56:52.399000+00:00) : yeah ive been watching it on and off
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T00:49:29.879000+00:00) : talent trees replace normal attribute leveling so it's not really a power creep either
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T00:49:10.710000+00:00) : they really didnt buff/nerf heroes that much, and it's mostly the same as 6.88
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T00:48:53.753000+00:00) : and they change the map like every patch
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T00:48:48.642000+00:00) : true but the only things you really have to learn are the backpack (which is simple) and the new map
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T00:47:52.269000+00:00) : plus when was the last time we actually try harded in dota, i think it's become more fun to not focus on the meta and just do clowny shit
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T00:46:30.706000+00:00) : you dont have to keep track of anything because tooltips exist
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T00:45:14.361000+00:00) : even morphling got some interesting buffs, at lv 25 you can either get +400 waveform range or +30% replicate damage
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T00:44:35.369000+00:00) : and techies seems really strong
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T00:44:28.248000+00:00) : mirana can actually be a really strong right click carry now
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T00:44:18.066000+00:00) : ronald i dont think you realize but all your heroes got buffed
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T00:44:09.540000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T00:38:44.496000+00:00) : thats like an entire modern AAA game
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T00:38:28.306000+00:00) : 6.6 GB patch wtf
71716577669550080 (2016-12-13T00:34:39.242000+00:00) : path live! <@!125452744440938497> want to play a quick game?
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:43:12.913000+00:00) : and i already have a runescape account
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:43:01.728000+00:00) : you already missed the night we got into hots
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:38:54.443000+00:00) : yeah because there havent been any patches and it got stale
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:31:37.443000+00:00) : nah im just going to get really good at all of ronald's heroes and it will be the same as it always was
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:24:54.398000+00:00) : we can just make good bots
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:24:50.727000+00:00) : that way we dont actually have to be good at dota
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:24:41.485000+00:00) : but we could compete in bot tournaments
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:24:36.547000+00:00) : it's really not that much harder
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:20:21.858000+00:00) : yeah lets make dota bots, they just opened up the API
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:19:11.150000+00:00) : k
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:18:51.769000+00:00) : can we do earlier in the day so i can play dota at night
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:16:52.206000+00:00) : keenan on friday or saturday do you want to play twilight
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:16:14.862000+00:00) : i thought grades were due on monday
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:12:00.102000+00:00) : but why do you need so much storage
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:11:54.067000+00:00) : understandable
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:10:39.353000+00:00) : as long as you have a custom passphrase for the umail
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:10:28.359000+00:00) : you just log into google drive with your umail
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:09:53.557000+00:00) : iu does
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:09:25.585000+00:00) : it gives you unlimited google drive storage
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:09:16.030000+00:00) : ?
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:09:00.856000+00:00) : it gives you unlimited drive
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:08:33.671000+00:00) : iu gives you unlimited
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:08:25.785000+00:00) : but why
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:00:39.271000+00:00) : so you aren't getting the best personal assistant possible with echo
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T23:00:17.928000+00:00) : also ronald, google will always have the best AI
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T22:58:56.322000+00:00) : why would you ever use the dot's features if you arent part of the amazon ecosystem and dont have any smart lights/thermostats/etc
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T22:56:23.092000+00:00) : they also will be better quality than echo dot for probably less money
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T22:50:36.776000+00:00) : all he says is lol and then immediately goes offline. classic <:ronald:230126993008623616>
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T22:45:56.848000+00:00) : and pineapple princess
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T22:45:46.168000+00:00) : i think it's just fallout radio songs
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T22:44:14.112000+00:00) : google home and the bigger echo are designed to be good speakers but the echo dot definitely is not designed for that
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T22:43:45.795000+00:00) : like the big echo is
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T22:43:40.273000+00:00) : it's also not designed to be a good speaker
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T22:43:30.305000+00:00) : i think the echo dot is too small to be a good speaker
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T22:43:09.051000+00:00) : the echo is not the useful unless you are either already integrated into the amazon app ecosystem or have a lot of smart home appliances
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T22:42:16.145000+00:00) : i'd rather wait until the next gen of home personal assistant devices
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T22:41:59.677000+00:00) : i
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T21:06:57.339000+00:00) : yeah i dont think his voice should have been that low

71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T03:20:54.601000+00:00) : i think im going to get really good at morphling to make up for ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T03:11:07.437000+00:00) : these dota terrains just keep getting better and better

71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T01:59:05.448000+00:00) : who cares about scale
71716577669550080 (2016-12-12T01:58:44.528000+00:00) : snorlax

71716577669550080 (2016-12-10T16:44:57.746000+00:00) : I picked them as my bracket winners, but I relied heavily on eg for my fantasy draft

71716577669550080 (2016-12-08T01:42:18.330000+00:00) : they have legit channels for every game and an "afk lounge" for whatever
71716577669550080 (2016-12-08T01:42:02.154000+00:00) : also they take it way more seriously

71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T20:03:42.906000+00:00) : because it's like if the gba could play current gen console games like gamecube and ps2 as well
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T20:03:10.546000+00:00) : but it's way better than that
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T19:57:50.432000+00:00) : ?
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T19:56:31.633000+00:00) : which is definitely me
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T19:56:05.942000+00:00) : that even if the switch starts off with mostly ports and a good vc library, people will be way more willing to rebuy games they already own than what is typically the case with ports on new consoles, just because it's portable
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T19:55:22.657000+00:00) : also the thing is
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T19:54:35.026000+00:00) : the best one

71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:27:23.918000+00:00) : i used to have him on my team but he didnt suit my power needs
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:26:24.465000+00:00) : he's a real cool boy
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:26:11.025000+00:00) : oh well you have to use it in battle

71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:24:29.359000+00:00) : i think one only evolves at night and the other in the day

71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:24:00.901000+00:00) : fomantis and morrelul are pretty standard
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:23:13.141000+00:00) : salandit only evolves if it's female
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:22:28.530000+00:00) : raichu? lol
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:21:44.780000+00:00) : although charjabug is competitively  viable if you put an eviolite on him
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:21:31.312000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:21:17.758000+00:00) : fourth island

71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:19:53.704000+00:00) : you cant until the end of the game

71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:18:24.581000+00:00) : ah yes you got to see the infamous pounding
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:17:17.195000+00:00) : so far it's my favorite zelda game
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:17:12.579000+00:00) : but you really need to play link between worlds at some point
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:15:46.730000+00:00) : yeah that's a little unfortunate that i wont get the original experience but i feel like i can kind of intuit what it was like
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:14:36.312000+00:00) : i like not being frustrated
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:14:32.252000+00:00) : i like easy
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:14:09.193000+00:00) : you need to play link between worlds
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:13:57.330000+00:00) : i bet that will change though
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:13:46.580000+00:00) : but for whatever reason im looking forward to twilight a lot more
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:13:33.354000+00:00) : because it comes first in the timeline
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:13:29.098000+00:00) : i am planning to
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:13:16.850000+00:00) : next friday
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:13:13.110000+00:00) : well that will be friday
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:12:34.358000+00:00) : unless you make me come over before then
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:12:16.445000+00:00) : also i hope you realize there's a good chance i will beat either majora or twilight princess or both before the 30th
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:11:05.230000+00:00) : same amount of lives but more people
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:10:57.161000+00:00) : i dont know how it functions in dktf or rayman but in mario the camera/bubble system can often get people killed, and you share the same life pool
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:10:21.757000+00:00) : i think so purely because you cant go at your own pace
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:09:35.601000+00:00) : especially in mario 3d world because it turns out the co-op players dont always co-operate
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:09:11.116000+00:00) : also i feel like co-op platforming games are significantly harder in co-op
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:07:14.138000+00:00) : i feel like both asher and i need to be trained. and if ronald is getting a wii u for his brother,  ronald needs to be at least as good as his brother
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:06:28.811000+00:00) : but for specifically things like you watching me play twilight princess should be separate
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:06:10.703000+00:00) : i mean the lan party can include some nintendo marathon stuff like you educating us on platformers for example
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:05:09.524000+00:00) : that can be separate from the lan party though i think
71716577669550080 (2016-12-07T02:04:38.302000+00:00) : i also got tropical freeze for 15 bucks on amazon

71716577669550080 (2016-12-01T15:07:02.459000+00:00) : this final fantasy game is notably different from the rest though
71716577669550080 (2016-12-01T15:06:05.582000+00:00) : same kind of combat and party system and open world rpg fantasy style

71716577669550080 (2016-11-30T21:21:03.576000+00:00) : it feels like an rpg very much in the style of xenoblade and xenoblade chronicles
71716577669550080 (2016-11-30T19:35:39.016000+00:00) : it doesnt even look like final fantasy or resemble it in any way

71716577669550080 (2016-11-28T21:17:17.310000+00:00) : which is why i think it suffices that this guy goes through that formula and various iterations of it
71716577669550080 (2016-11-28T21:16:58.862000+00:00) : it might get boring because a lot of them use the same basic formula
71716577669550080 (2016-11-28T21:16:18.406000+00:00) : that would be a lot of work
71716577669550080 (2016-11-28T21:11:15.210000+00:00) : i really like his zelda dungeon analysis too

71716577669550080 (2016-11-27T22:43:53.589000+00:00) : i think headphones are always better
71716577669550080 (2016-11-27T06:47:06.910000+00:00) : there are these traveling musicians in the milk bar who play these songs for 10 rupees
71716577669550080 (2016-11-27T06:46:30.287000+00:00) : the milk bar soundtrack from link between worlds is so good https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSrVa7QN64g&index=13&list=PLJtLAyYfDCShbw4IGLdk_MpZT5F7WfbZT
71716577669550080 (2016-11-27T03:12:10.874000+00:00) : because their effects only apply in battle
71716577669550080 (2016-11-27T03:12:01.926000+00:00) : yeah the only use of hyper training is to max the IVs of legendaries you cant breed
71716577669550080 (2016-11-27T03:11:48.589000+00:00) : of course
71716577669550080 (2016-11-27T03:11:35.192000+00:00) : as rare as master balls at the lotto
71716577669550080 (2016-11-27T03:11:29.526000+00:00) : and it costs bottle caps to do which are really rare
71716577669550080 (2016-11-27T03:11:18.551000+00:00) : meaning it doesnt work for breeding and the true IVs remain the same
71716577669550080 (2016-11-27T03:11:03.495000+00:00) : its only fake
71716577669550080 (2016-11-27T03:10:57.209000+00:00) : so hyper training (maxing IVs at lv 100) isnt as broken as i thought
71716577669550080 (2016-11-27T03:09:35.738000+00:00) : like all the tapus are on one page

71716577669550080 (2016-11-26T21:06:08.156000+00:00) : it ends up having a lot of complexity which is especially impressive considering it was made by just one guy
71716577669550080 (2016-11-26T21:02:56.413000+00:00) : i hope it wins indie game of the year

71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T22:42:59.696000+00:00) : i really liked it because it was easier in difficulty than other zeldas i played, and it's also open world. I didnt even get all the items or upgrades and could still beat it

71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T15:57:19.084000+00:00) : you cant watch a movie without playing the game first
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T15:56:16.060000+00:00) : before this movie comes out
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T15:56:10.246000+00:00) : guys we need to marathon the lego batman series
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T05:11:24.557000+00:00) : Never die on boss battles
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T05:11:18.514000+00:00) : Although the whole game is fairly easy for a Zelda title
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T05:11:00.526000+00:00) : The dungeons are nice and short
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T05:10:48.897000+00:00) : I forgot how amazing this game is
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T05:09:37.738000+00:00) : Almost done
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T05:09:30.841000+00:00) : Guys I did three a link between worlds dungeons today
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T03:44:17.789000+00:00) : https://imgur.com/Lz2oyPM.jpg
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T02:50:50.152000+00:00) : dont you still have to do side quests and stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T02:49:58.105000+00:00) : that doesnt seem like much
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T02:49:46.915000+00:00) : dont you only have like 60 hours in it
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:50:50.247000+00:00) : Zelda is literally fallout but more about puzzles and exploration
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:45:29.782000+00:00) : It's pretty amazing that between the Wii u and the 3ds you can legally play every single Zelda game
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:44:44.943000+00:00) : I mean they just put a bunch of original wii games on the eShop for Wii u
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:44:18.378000+00:00) : And it's not that hard to just put old games on the eshop
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:43:58.755000+00:00) : There's a good chance a lot of games will.get ported because the Wii u had a lot of good titles that not many people got to play
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:42:49.081000+00:00) : There's some rumor that Xenoblade Chronicles X will get a port
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:42:35.589000+00:00) : Which ones? I'm sure they'll get ports
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:40:53.934000+00:00) : You would probably really like fire emblem ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:40:23.353000+00:00) : But a Wii doesn't fit in your pocket
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:39:09.398000+00:00) : And a shit ton of jrpgs
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:39:04.084000+00:00) : Ronald there's also smash and mario kart on the 3ds
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:37:46.366000+00:00) : A link between worlds is like the best 3ds game besides pokemon
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:37:22.521000+00:00) : 3ds also gets a lot of indie titles
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:35:10.963000+00:00) : Phones aren't really designed for long term gaming
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:34:59.885000+00:00) : And a battery life actually meant for playing games
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:34:42.177000+00:00) : And the 3ds has buttons
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:34:35.861000+00:00) : Also there are no good mobile games
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:33:53.607000+00:00) : Yeah the pokemon models are extremely high in polygon count
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:33:18.510000+00:00) : No because it's too intensive graphically to handle the double resolution of the 3d
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:32:36.068000+00:00) : The latest pokemon game doesn't even support 3d
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:31:30.777000+00:00) : You don't have to use that
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:31:15.834000+00:00) : There's so much you can play on it
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:31:04.906000+00:00) : You should
71716577669550080 (2016-11-25T00:30:18.415000+00:00) : I kind of want to go buy that $99 3ds for my brother
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T23:33:38.945000+00:00) : rip
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T06:21:08.207000+00:00) : And it had a cute Asian chick in it not a boy
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T06:20:53.191000+00:00) : They got it on Amazon
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T06:16:02.030000+00:00) : What if you get trampled
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T06:15:27.496000+00:00) : That's basically the same
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T06:15:04.821000+00:00) : Do you really want to go to walmart on black Friday
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T06:14:26.071000+00:00) : Ok wtf

71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T06:09:54.314000+00:00) : It probably will again
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T06:09:39.771000+00:00) : Well I've seen it go on sale for 400 a couple times
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T06:08:55.942000+00:00) : Well i got it right when it came out
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T06:08:13.761000+00:00) : It retailed at 500 when it came out. 480 isn't even really a deal
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T06:07:43.693000+00:00) : It has before
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T06:07:36.545000+00:00) : It will
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T06:06:48.267000+00:00) : You asked if it was good though
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T06:05:46.081000+00:00) : I don't trust any electronic under 20 that only has 4 reviews
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T05:58:28.047000+00:00) : Do ps4 games still cost 60 dollars or do they go down or on sale if they are older
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T05:57:05.443000+00:00) : Of too many jrpgs
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T05:56:51.048000+00:00) : Money aside, I feel like it also just adds to your problem
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T05:54:25.905000+00:00) : No time
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T05:54:19.522000+00:00) : Like a collection of the best mega man games is on sale on the eShop for 8 dollars and I really want to get it
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T05:52:49.701000+00:00) : Although I did just beat a 50 hour jrpg in 6 days but maybe that's because I'm a little too obsessed
71716577669550080 (2016-11-24T05:51:34.771000+00:00) : That's how I feel about this Zelda series I need to complete

71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:53:44.019000+00:00) : there's a place on melemele island where there's a really rare chance to find a bagon
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:53:29.319000+00:00) : holy shit

71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:47:59.912000+00:00) : bull shit
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:47:56.764000+00:00) : shit wtf this guy only learns one steel type move and that's gyro ball
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:46:40.964000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:44:52.515000+00:00) : for some reason i really like the concept of a steel electric pokemon that doesnt look like a machine
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:44:23.404000+00:00) : yeah i really want him on my team but i think my steel type is going to be the steel/electric pikachu clone
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:43:14.410000+00:00) : salandit will be my fire type
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:42:57.202000+00:00) : she's ice and fairy
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:42:53.999000+00:00) : but nope
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:42:52.233000+00:00) : i was thinking "ninetails is going to be my fire type this gen"
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:42:40.242000+00:00) : also i just realized today that ninetails isnt fire type
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:41:23.609000+00:00) : because i think some trainer told me that
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:41:02.089000+00:00) : i dont know why but i have a feeling that cutiefly is rare
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:38:39.067000+00:00) : but i think i have some other rare mons
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:38:31.790000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:38:18.465000+00:00) : i saw a trainer that had one
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:38:13.843000+00:00) : like in the wild?
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:37:34.538000+00:00) : the old man just gives you a drink and talks you about deep aspects of life
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:37:18.619000+00:00) : I cant figure out the purpose
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:37:12.633000+00:00) : btw have you figured out the point of the cafes yet?
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:37:00.896000+00:00) : pokemon games always have on point dialogue
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:34:11.013000+00:00) : "aww it's so cute... oh... OH. *OH It abducts children?!?*?
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:33:17.343000+00:00) : that woman is a perfect representation of how i feel the average person would perceive pokemon
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:32:53.454000+00:00) : i cant belive i got 10,000 pokebucks for that shit
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:32:37.631000+00:00) : i did
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:25:07.857000+00:00) : and repeat that process
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:25:02.949000+00:00) : you kill the original, and then make the summoned ally call for help
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T17:24:49.033000+00:00) : i think all pokemon can summon allies? I'm not sure. there are certain conditions that will increase the chances if the wild pokemon calling for help
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:31:14.306000+00:00) : is this the show with the french fries
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:15:11.136000+00:00) : and each subsequent ally they call has an increased chance to be shiny
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:14:58.081000+00:00) : you chain by making wild pokemon repeadedly call allies for help
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:14:08.581000+00:00) : thats no fun
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:13:09.810000+00:00) : ok one of my goals is to make a smeargle perfect for chaining shinies
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:12:37.678000+00:00) : ah
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:11:56.162000+00:00) : and then after that how do you get another move if it only has 1 pp
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:11:46.843000+00:00) : but how do you sketch a move
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:09:59.845000+00:00) : i need to figure out how to use sketch to get a smeargle with a full custom move set
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:07:31.735000+00:00) : i thought he was small
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:07:28.346000+00:00) : why the hell is he so big
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:07:16.844000+00:00) : like smeargle is fucking huge
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:07:12.046000+00:00) : yeah i saw that
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:03:33.278000+00:00) : was it alola
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:03:28.732000+00:00) : i saw a gastly in the cemetary
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:00:53.100000+00:00) : and bam you have pokemon stars
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:00:42.136000+00:00) : it's so easy for them to just take sun and moon, bump up the res, maybe add a bit more extra content, and slap on some windwaker shaders like they did for windwaker hd
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:00:11.393000+00:00) : and it will be fucking beautiful
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T16:00:04.423000+00:00) : they will probably add shaders link windwaker
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:59:58.007000+00:00) : yeah it will just be all the same high polygoon models but with no jagged lines
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:59:12.340000+00:00) : i forgive pokemon on the 3ds because a) the models have extremely high polygons and b) the cell shading and overworld looks pretty decent
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:58:35.208000+00:00) : and did it bad
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:58:31.539000+00:00) : yeah there were a lot of gba games that tried to do 3d
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:57:55.004000+00:00) : 3ds has low res which looks bad when you try to do 3d models
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:57:39.036000+00:00) : the sp had low res but it didnt matter because games werent 3d for the most part so they still hold up and look good
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:57:03.191000+00:00) : mainly the resolution
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:56:57.082000+00:00) : it has it's flaws
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:56:52.051000+00:00) : idk i really like my 3ds
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:56:47.310000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:56:13.094000+00:00) : and when you consider that the GBA is just a handheld snes it makes the gba amazing too
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:56:00.803000+00:00) : somewhat
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:55:57.379000+00:00) : i agree
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:55:39.649000+00:00) : snes is just moore's law at work
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:55:12.450000+00:00) : and dont forget real controllers
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:54:57.083000+00:00) : gc is just n64 with better graphics and more experienced 3d devs
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:54:37.646000+00:00) : by the time gamecube came
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:54:32.263000+00:00) : yes because they figured out how to do camera
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:53:49.533000+00:00) : snes was the perfect improvement on the nes, the gamecube was the perfect improvement on the n64, and the wii u was the perfect improvement on the wii although they just marketed it poorly
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:53:17.999000+00:00) : but my point of the snes being superior still stands
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:53:09.757000+00:00) : i accept that
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:52:15.502000+00:00) : i dont want to write down codes
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:52:03.001000+00:00) : which had stupid fucking codes
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:51:56.655000+00:00) : and then there's metroid
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:51:52.567000+00:00) : eh
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:51:24.031000+00:00) : but it's a shitty and frustrating way to increase difficulty
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:51:13.766000+00:00) : it's an increase in difficulty because the carts couldnt hold much data to make the games longer
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:50:59.856000+00:00) : yeah i understand why you cant save
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:50:40.279000+00:00) : it cant have too many annoyances
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:50:26.715000+00:00) : like i said if i get frustrated by a game i just dont play it
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:50:14.057000+00:00) : yeah most frustrating part
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:49:18.840000+00:00) : even though the classic fixed some of the problems by allowing you to save anywhere
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:48:56.220000+00:00) : for me the nes doesnt meet that requirement
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:48:45.423000+00:00) : i think snes is the perfect retro console in that all of its games still hold up perfectly today
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:48:07.631000+00:00) : which will be far superior
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:47:58.385000+00:00) : im just going to wait for the snes classic edition
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:46:57.861000+00:00) : within 30 seconds
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:46:53.841000+00:00) : but they also sold out on amazon
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:45:58.435000+00:00) : yeah i think nintend severely underestimated how popular that would be
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:45:44.454000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:45:25.602000+00:00) : that was also absurdly popular
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:45:21.017000+00:00) : did you guys sell tthe nes classic edition
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:44:49.976000+00:00) : these are the most pre-ordered games in nintendo history
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:44:39.370000+00:00) : probably should have bought more
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:21:39.340000+00:00) : because those guys look awesome too
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:21:28.641000+00:00) : i cant wait until we see the true evil of the aether foundation
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:16:55.308000+00:00) : he's just the wimp who stands in the back while grunt b does all the fighting
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:16:20.261000+00:00) : grunt a is my favorite character
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:10:59.925000+00:00) : today is just my age birthday
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:10:46.418000+00:00) : my true birthday was yesterday
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:09:17.355000+00:00) : if the switch relly gets 3d mario platformer, mario rpg, mario kart, zelda, pokemon, splatoon, skyrim, all within the first 6-8 months of its launch there's no doubt it will sell well
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:07:50.850000+00:00) : when we get to see trailers
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:07:46.733000+00:00) : for januarary
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:07:38.464000+00:00) : im hype
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:07:04.499000+00:00) : but i know about them
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:06:59.904000+00:00) : zero
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:06:39.561000+00:00) : also i think the rabbids characters fit right into the mario universe
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:05:12.121000+00:00) : rayman who uses rabbids as a final smash
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:04:57.418000+00:00) : but oh well
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:04:55.378000+00:00) : he should have been in the last one
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:04:50.781000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:04:30.404000+00:00) : like ZombiU launched with the wii U and I never played it but I heard it was the best launch title
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:03:44.374000+00:00) : like they always have good games at launch for nintendo
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:03:37.057000+00:00) : ubisoft has historically been one of the better third parties on nintendo consoles
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:03:12.352000+00:00) : i hope it's like the rest of them
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:03:05.384000+00:00) : and also i love the turn based mario rpgs
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:02:57.669000+00:00) : it's definitely smarter to brand it that way
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:02:50.181000+00:00) : mario is a way bigger brand than rabbits
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T15:02:11.438000+00:00) : I like this statement "Nintendo intends to pitch the project to consumers as a Mario RPG project in collaboration with Ubisoft, in spite of Ubisoft doing most of the work on development."
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T14:54:23.666000+00:00) : theres also this: http://letsplayvideogames.com/2016/11/report-ubisoft-developing-rabbids-mario-crossover-rpg-for-switch-launch-day/
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T14:37:03.848000+00:00) : because black and white 2 came out on the DS when the 3ds was already almost a year old
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T14:36:43.357000+00:00) : i mean theres a new pokemon game roughly every year so thats not surprising but it being on the switch instead of 3ds is kind of surprising
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T13:13:12.405000+00:00) : <@155893986605793281>   http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-11-18-nintendo-switch-will-get-pokemon-sun-and-moon-version

71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T01:10:51.985000+00:00) : Keenan i never knew I wanted a personal rotom assistant in pokemon
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T00:29:51.793000+00:00) : because it's had the longest development time and will be really big
71716577669550080 (2016-11-18T00:29:33.313000+00:00) : everyone is saying the next dota patch will be 7.00

71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T22:51:55.059000+00:00) : Holy shit my mom has a bed now
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T22:51:00.715000+00:00) : Of instead of moving to alola you were shipwrecked there
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T22:50:43+00:00) : You know what would have been cool
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T22:48:29.716000+00:00) : Half of this games space must be cut scene data
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T22:48:09.064000+00:00) : Did not realize cut scenes could be this good
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T22:43:37.616000+00:00) : Holy shit this music
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T20:25:20.655000+00:00) : literally racism
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T20:25:12.903000+00:00) : ok but gen 1 getting the only new forms is a pretty big deal
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T20:19:27.933000+00:00) : although you do get johto starters in oras
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T20:19:08.733000+00:00) : still they are doing too much for gen 1
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T20:18:57.778000+00:00) : i guess..........................
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T20:16:53.339000+00:00) : gen 2 and 4 and 5 dont even have mega evos

71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T20:14:22.805000+00:00) : ?
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T20:00:52.998000+00:00) : i think this is all very good considering this game is more open and focused on exploration

71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T18:50:07.377000+00:00) : and all previous pokemon games have had that
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T18:49:53.531000+00:00) : also in pokemon, the characters and story that people get attached to aren't the humans it's the pokemon and their lore
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T18:49:00.187000+00:00) : i mean truly every game just boils down to a worse version of pokemon
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T18:48:25.916000+00:00) : not after playing any other pokemon game
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T18:48:21.379000+00:00) : which is why i said after playing moon

71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T18:47:05.799000+00:00) : i get the impression it's just a worse version of pokemon but with devils and shit
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T18:46:38.305000+00:00) : keenan do you really think you will be able to play smt apocalypse after this

71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T18:45:19.827000+00:00) : he's not going to care on the same level that we do though until he gets the game himself
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T18:44:22.963000+00:00) : i love how we're the only ones in this chat who care about this game

71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:54:01.194000+00:00) : or sooner
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:53:59.268000+00:00) : because amazon essentially has to get the item in like 3 days before it actually releases
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:53:44.118000+00:00) : im afraid it wouldnt work

71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:52:34.447000+00:00) : amazon  does release-day delivery
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:52:28.777000+00:00) : shit
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:49:47.880000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:49:44.462000+00:00) : the main story takes like 100 hours
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:49:34.078000+00:00) : thats impossible
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:48:48.008000+00:00) : *but how does it feel*
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:48:29.981000+00:00) : keenan how does it feel that your favorite game, majora, has less sales than zelda II
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:45:28.362000+00:00) : did not expect that
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:45:24.796000+00:00) : twilight princess is the best selling zelda game
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:45:18.031000+00:00) : also what the hell
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:43:53.528000+00:00) : unless you add remakes/remasters together
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:43:46.510000+00:00) : no zelda game has sold over 10 million copies
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:41:42.489000+00:00) : you're always right
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:41:40.104000+00:00) : nintendo you got me agaian
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:41:35.713000+00:00) : i think i was wrong.... 😦
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:41:27.831000+00:00) : it's definitely a lot smarter to release the switch with a new mario than a new zelda
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:41:11.878000+00:00) : even fucking ocarina of time only sold 7.6m compared to sm64 which was 11m
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:40:43.674000+00:00) : Link to the past only sold 4.6 mil and super mario world sold 20.6 million
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:39:38.353000+00:00) : zelda is definitely for a niche market
71716577669550080 (2016-11-17T00:39:26.895000+00:00) : also i just realized how low zelda games sell compared to other nintendo franchises

71716577669550080 (2016-11-16T18:19:50.911000+00:00) : just because of the technical capability
71716577669550080 (2016-11-16T18:19:37.262000+00:00) : like i think a game like dktf is probably a lot more polished and diverse than a game like dkc2
71716577669550080 (2016-11-16T18:18:34.985000+00:00) : if something frustrates me enough i'll just give up
71716577669550080 (2016-11-16T18:18:26.266000+00:00) : i dont tolerate things like that
71716577669550080 (2016-11-16T18:16:37.307000+00:00) : or gameplay elements
71716577669550080 (2016-11-16T18:16:32.755000+00:00) : or there are major annoyances with controls
71716577669550080 (2016-11-16T18:16:24.843000+00:00) : i just dont like how a lot of older games are limited on the technical side
71716577669550080 (2016-11-16T18:15:17.176000+00:00) : dont know about dk
71716577669550080 (2016-11-16T18:15:13.439000+00:00) : in general
71716577669550080 (2016-11-16T18:15:00.451000+00:00) : but i always think newer games are better than older ones
71716577669550080 (2016-11-16T18:14:48.624000+00:00) : i havent really played any of them
71716577669550080 (2016-11-16T18:13:48.168000+00:00) : partially because david wise did the soundtrack for tropical freeze but not for dkc returns
71716577669550080 (2016-11-16T18:13:31.602000+00:00) : like way better than dkc returns

71716577669550080 (2016-11-16T17:23:30.090000+00:00) : About 2.5 hours into the webcast, I hear someone come into the
house, which is odd, because my only housemate is at work, and we 
aren't expecting anyone. I realize I didn't check to see if the doors 
were locked before starting the webcast. I hear the person stealthily moving 
around the house, and then I hear them stealthily climbing the stairs, 
towards my room. My door opens, and I hear an unfamiliar male
voice say "Hello?". Then, after presumably seeing me sitting still and 
smiling in front of a camera, lit from beneath by a florescent bulb, he 
promptly descends the stairs and exits the house.

71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T17:31:49.072000+00:00) : the only way you can prevent me from learning about games before they release is not to release any info

71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T17:17:43.767000+00:00) : they cant just drop them like that
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T17:17:39.833000+00:00) : that was such a hype feature of xy and oras
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T17:17:26.790000+00:00) : although im kind of disappointed they didnt add new mega evolutions
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T17:17:05.356000+00:00) : since yoou can only use them once and they can easily be messed up with protect or a switch out
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T17:16:45.517000+00:00) : it seems like z-moves are a lot more balanced than mega evolutions
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T17:15:51.329000+00:00) : fuck no
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T17:15:49.341000+00:00) : fight evil?

71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T17:14:16.095000+00:00) : went back to route 1 and blasted zigzagoons
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T17:14:01.641000+00:00) : thats what i did in oras as soon as i got mega rayquaza with dragon pulse
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T17:13:34.003000+00:00) : my hobby in this game is going to be wrecking noob pokemon with z moves
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:59:50.028000+00:00) : so i would have to set up some sort of spell checker and docx formatter within vim
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:59:31.335000+00:00) : there's no plugin for word
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:59:24.511000+00:00) : ok no joke i actually want to figure out a way to write my essays in vim
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:42:14.197000+00:00) : i try to download the client version of everythin
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:41:59.982000+00:00) : i hate that too oddly enough
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:39:47.339000+00:00) : 90% of the time i dont need all the features word has
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:36:59.273000+00:00) : only did it when i absolutely needed it to edit a word file
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:36:39.486000+00:00) : i went 8 months on my desktop without installing office
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:35:46.338000+00:00) : very convenient
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:35:37.719000+00:00) : well thats really lightweight
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:35:31.896000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:35:21.919000+00:00) : i like how it's more lightweight
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:35:00.385000+00:00) : also collab
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:34:33.741000+00:00) : because i dont need anything more complicated than for most purposes
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:34:03.436000+00:00) : i use the client too but i edit in google docs most of the time
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:33:44.052000+00:00) : drive should really be my most used
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:33:34.957000+00:00) : same with google drive
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:33:24.172000+00:00) : which is weird
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:33:21.661000+00:00) : but it doesn't count gmail because it's always open and i never really open it naturally
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:32:57.280000+00:00) : like it should be gmail canvas reddit
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:32:35.503000+00:00) : it's just pinned
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:32:32.787000+00:00) : the only reason gmail.com isn't my most used as well is because i have it open constantly
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:32:02.611000+00:00) : i use inbox on my phone with iu though
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:31:55.815000+00:00) : ah ok
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:31:36.699000+00:00) : you should be able to check iu email just by going to nromal gmail
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:31:24.975000+00:00) : that means you havent set it up properly
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:31:10.377000+00:00) : lol umail

71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T16:30:09.828000+00:00) : so canvas has finally surpassed reddit

71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T15:51:29.929000+00:00) : about the scientist people
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T15:51:25.835000+00:00) : i bet it's exactly what we predicted
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T15:51:19.496000+00:00) : people are saying it has a really good story
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T15:49:36.436000+00:00) : "Poké Pelago, the side quests, the absolutely stunning nature of the presentation, it's all a sheer joy from start to finish. Game Freak hasn't missed a beat and has managed to carefully balance the inclusion of new mechanics without totally ruining things for the most hardcore fans. It's got content coming out of its ears, a much more interesting story, and rewards exploration in a way no other title in the series has. Whether you're a Pokémon fan new or old, this is an absolutely essential purchase."
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T15:49:20.248000+00:00) : "Simply put, Sun and Moon are best Pokémon games that Game Freak has ever produced. "
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T15:47:18.777000+00:00) : another quote: "I think Pokemon Sun & Moon is a bit brilliant. It’s not quite perfect, but it’s best Pokemon release in years."
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T15:46:28.696000+00:00) : another review quote of sumo: "The end result is not just the best Pokémon game ever, but one of the best video games ever made."

71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T15:25:04.433000+00:00) : i only like old games if they are pixel graphics or wind-waker style

71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:50:53.511000+00:00) : yeah i think so still because it has metagross
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:50:36.257000+00:00) : so i guess if i mainly play from 6-11 it will be day
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:50:20.248000+00:00) : because pokemon night starts at like 6pm
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:50:10.813000+00:00) : or maybe night idk
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:50:07.747000+00:00) : i think the majority of my time playing will be during the day
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:49:44.390000+00:00) : it's so weird though
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:49:05.999000+00:00) : i dont know how i feel about that
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:49:01.377000+00:00) : so it will be night during the day and day during the night
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:48:52.523000+00:00) : also keenan i remembered that pokemon moon takes place 12 hours later than sun
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:47:55.814000+00:00) : lol

71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:47:16.318000+00:00) : you should go say hi miyamoto
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:46:50.397000+00:00) : that would be cool
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:46:46.818000+00:00) : so you could buy it there if so
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:46:41.329000+00:00) : i think the switch might be region free
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:46:16.892000+00:00) : that way i can be at the nintendo store which is basically japan
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:46:04.740000+00:00) : i might try to be in new york during spring break
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:45:32.963000+00:00) : in japan?
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:45:22.323000+00:00) : why
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:45:19.901000+00:00) : how
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:45:17.586000+00:00) : wow
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:44:58.912000+00:00) : no but im guessing spring break
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:44:45.651000+00:00) : march
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:43:19.882000+00:00) : yeah stupid valve spends all their time patching their old games instead of making new ones
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:42:14.962000+00:00) : why should nintendo
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:42:07.640000+00:00) : i mean bethesda doesnt seem to care
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:41:36.348000+00:00) : help the speedrunners out a little bit
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:41:29.263000+00:00) : they should just not do testing
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:41:23.730000+00:00) : apparently they still have to do a lot of testing
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:40:56.179000+00:00) : you can release it sooner and fix it with patches
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:40:44.423000+00:00) : fuck his famous quote
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:39:30.796000+00:00) : http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-11-15-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-will-miss-nintendo-switch-launch
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:39:21.783000+00:00) : due to an immense amount of dialogue and voice acting
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:39:05.531000+00:00) : there are some rumors going around that localization is taking longer than they thought
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:38:18.950000+00:00) : oh yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:37:38.685000+00:00) : and that hurts sales of both?
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:37:33.635000+00:00) : or vice versa
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:37:30.549000+00:00) : you are saying that people with 60 bucks are going to rather invest that in botw then the switch
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:36:06.548000+00:00) : because you can say the same thing about mario
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:35:58.679000+00:00) : so then it should have no launch titles?
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:35:12.872000+00:00) : thats all that matters
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:35:08.772000+00:00) : people wont buy a system without games
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:35:02.286000+00:00) : no it should be the primary incentive
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:33:36.762000+00:00) : they are also heavily invested in the switch doing well
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:32:49.071000+00:00) : their entire show
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:32:45.450000+00:00) : it was literally all they showed at e3
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:32:35.678000+00:00) : why wouldn't they
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T14:26:39.202000+00:00) : 😦 i'll probably have to play some shitty mario game instead
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T12:51:49.885000+00:00) : botw is looking more and more like it wont be a launch title
71716577669550080 (2016-11-15T12:51:40.240000+00:00) : im so sad
71716577669550080 (2016-11-14T23:52:35.177000+00:00) : i think  he shut it down himself
71716577669550080 (2016-11-14T20:38:06.005000+00:00) : tfw you need a professional portrait of yourself so you crop your family's christmas photo
71716577669550080 (2016-11-14T20:36:40.800000+00:00) : since ronald deleted his message, if you scroll through history it just looks like ben and I sent the same picture of ronald spontaneously at the exact same time
71716577669550080 (2016-11-14T20:34:56.996000+00:00) : tfw you need to send something to yourself but your email isn't working
71716577669550080 (2016-11-14T20:33:40.048000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2016-11-14T20:30:32.321000+00:00) : like what even is the point at this point
71716577669550080 (2016-11-14T20:30:16.945000+00:00) : but can you believe nintendo is still releasing info
71716577669550080 (2016-11-14T20:13:54.271000+00:00) : decidueye is literally raining justice from above

71716577669550080 (2016-11-14T01:40:29.271000+00:00) : because personally im glad they took away super training and went back to the old method and just buffed it

71716577669550080 (2016-11-13T01:14:05.470000+00:00) : Suggest it on their forums, they implement most things on there
71716577669550080 (2016-11-13T01:13:27.277000+00:00) : "read by 30 people" and then you click for exact names
71716577669550080 (2016-11-13T01:12:58.934000+00:00) : What if your server had 50 people
71716577669550080 (2016-11-13T01:12:34.125000+00:00) : That's kind of hard for large groups isn't it
71716577669550080 (2016-11-13T01:09:19.205000+00:00) : The switch better have full on RGB lighting or I'm not buying it

71716577669550080 (2016-11-13T01:07:01.477000+00:00) : Do any of them glow
71716577669550080 (2016-11-13T01:03:59.448000+00:00) : Most of the other game consoles are ugly
71716577669550080 (2016-11-13T01:03:41.434000+00:00) : Like the Xbox one S was super nice looking
71716577669550080 (2016-11-13T01:03:27.338000+00:00) : All of Microsofts products looks so beautiful
71716577669550080 (2016-11-13T01:02:41.632000+00:00) : I could have tried the HTC vive too but didn't want to look stupid in public
71716577669550080 (2016-11-13T00:59:51.870000+00:00) : Really high res
71716577669550080 (2016-11-13T00:59:42.645000+00:00) : Would be really good for media consumption

71716577669550080 (2016-11-08T15:19:13.470000+00:00) : it would be slightly different but you would have the same idea
71716577669550080 (2016-11-08T15:19:01.607000+00:00) : you could just create a mario maker kaizo version
71716577669550080 (2016-11-08T15:18:42.657000+00:00) : its basically the same

71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T23:31:23.666000+00:00) : video
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T23:31:20.681000+00:00) : huys
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:45:14.564000+00:00) : wake me up to play games in an hour guys
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:34:48.265000+00:00) : and general abilities
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:34:37.067000+00:00) : and i mean in terms of just lore
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:34:25.325000+00:00) : sombra is defrinitely the most powerful overwatch character
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:20:24.758000+00:00) : overwatch clearly tries to structure the meta
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:20:17.787000+00:00) : in dota they are but not in overwatch
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:18:18.321000+00:00) : bhut they just did come uup with that but didnt classify her as support
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:18:03.396000+00:00) : i feel like blizzard isn't creative enough to come up with any supporting character that provides utility that's not just healing
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:17:14.616000+00:00) : to be fair reaper's teleport is already pretty shitty and should be buffed
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:16:18.121000+00:00) : also more omnics
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:16:14.329000+00:00) : overwatch needs a more diverse support class
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:16:02.836000+00:00) : i just think she easily could have been a support with a slightly altered moveset/stats
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:14:39.055000+00:00) : her gun does not look very strong at all
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:14:20.786000+00:00) : as a void player
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:14:18.862000+00:00) : me
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:13:49.824000+00:00) : support riki
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:13:43.504000+00:00) : she's basically like riki as i see it
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:13:32.457000+00:00) : saetup is a way of supporting
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:13:22.280000+00:00) : thats definitely a support skill
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:12:21.828000+00:00) : except they dont classify her as support because she cant heal probably
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:12:11.478000+00:00) : all of her moves are supporting style
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:11:56.595000+00:00) : there's no way sombra should be attack
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:09:22.346000+00:00) : lol wtf asher
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:09:09.638000+00:00) : because honestly the support class is another thing dota does extremely well compared to toher games
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:08:36.602000+00:00) : also they need to stop making supports all healers besides symmetra
71716577669550080 (2016-11-04T21:06:39.709000+00:00) : yeah usually all games balance invis extremely poorly with the exception of dota

71716577669550080 (2016-11-03T21:48:25.902000+00:00) : It's unclear if he cursed Ronald or you though
71716577669550080 (2016-11-03T21:47:31.186000+00:00) : I guess I was cursed
71716577669550080 (2016-11-03T21:47:20.541000+00:00) : I can't get the image of the curse out of my head
71716577669550080 (2016-11-03T21:46:48.232000+00:00) : Didn't realize he also told you his name
71716577669550080 (2016-11-03T21:46:36.151000+00:00) : But didn't think it was enough to conclude his name was Ricky
71716577669550080 (2016-11-03T21:46:17.178000+00:00) : Ok i saw that part
71716577669550080 (2016-11-03T21:45:02.141000+00:00) : I'm not sure how you guys know his name is Ricky
71716577669550080 (2016-11-03T21:41:28.157000+00:00) : At least we have some good stuff for your gravestone
71716577669550080 (2016-11-03T21:40:42.279000+00:00) : Keenan I'm sorry if you die
71716577669550080 (2016-11-03T21:40:36.111000+00:00) : I usually never laugh out loud when I'm by myself
71716577669550080 (2016-11-03T21:37:52.607000+00:00) : Just read through everything... That got intense real fast
71716577669550080 (2016-11-03T02:29:28.575000+00:00) : not as the k.k. though
71716577669550080 (2016-11-03T02:29:25.080000+00:00) : keenan totaka is actually in this video

71716577669550080 (2016-11-03T02:16:24.552000+00:00) : this is definitely what i expect to see in a video game news video
71716577669550080 (2016-11-03T02:15:03.506000+00:00) : it's really... strange.

71716577669550080 (2016-10-28T15:14:46.954000+00:00) : I realized that when major news networks talk about politics they are spending the majority of the time discussing rumors or non-issues and the same 4 topics over and over again to fill time. And that is no different at all than people on Reddit taking about the switch and nx news
71716577669550080 (2016-10-28T02:45:07.099000+00:00) : i dont know why but people selling their consoles really makes me sad
71716577669550080 (2016-10-28T02:42:54.301000+00:00) : 😦
71716577669550080 (2016-10-28T02:25:59.655000+00:00) : maybe it's just wii emulation
71716577669550080 (2016-10-28T02:25:41.795000+00:00) : is it only that game?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-28T02:23:13.214000+00:00) : it could be a trap
71716577669550080 (2016-10-28T02:22:31.104000+00:00) : laziness
71716577669550080 (2016-10-28T02:21:51.381000+00:00) : sounds sketch
71716577669550080 (2016-10-28T02:20:46.250000+00:00) : i have important logistical questions

71716577669550080 (2016-10-28T02:16:16.172000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-10-28T02:14:02.793000+00:00) : it's crazy how all products are refined prototypes
71716577669550080 (2016-10-28T02:13:18.620000+00:00) : yeah ive known about that since the wii u
71716577669550080 (2016-10-28T02:12:49.919000+00:00) : ?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-28T00:45:18.332000+00:00) : so you aren't applying as a transfer student but instead as a normal freshmen?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-28T00:42:46.831000+00:00) : yeah you probably cant get credit for a class and have it not appear on your transcript
71716577669550080 (2016-10-28T00:41:38.627000+00:00) : why?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-28T00:37:00.003000+00:00) : asher if you aren't going to iu, do your credits that you have from iu transfer?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:43:14.817000+00:00) : she's probably still associated with the school very closely
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:43:05.808000+00:00) : it might still work though
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:42:58.514000+00:00) : oh yeah i forgot about that
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:42:26.467000+00:00) : isnt it just on mccsc website?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:40:16.632000+00:00) : im sure it will be at bestbuy and stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:39:44.755000+00:00) : yeah i really wish i was into art so i could use all the cool surface tech microsoft has

71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:33:46.103000+00:00) : it's new technology it will take a while but it's far suprerior in every way
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:33:17.467000+00:00) : my desktop has one
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:33:14.405000+00:00) : google's chromebooks use it
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:33:06.965000+00:00) : thats why i said apple is fucking up their phones
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:27:32.511000+00:00) : its like the top of the line mobile card
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:27:17.262000+00:00) : it's a mobile card but still
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:26:58.557000+00:00) : keenan did you see that the surface studio has dedicated graphics
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:22:12.003000+00:00) : dont get me wrong apple is fucking up with their phones but their computers have always been top notch
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:20:53.462000+00:00) : the lack of a physical esc is bothering but honestly i always have caps lock mapped to esc anyway
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:20:31.339000+00:00) : there are lots of uses in design work and programming
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:20:17.266000+00:00) : and honestly a touch bar like that is pretty innovative
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:18:27.268000+00:00) : and it charges to full in 1 hour
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:18:18.808000+00:00) : my phone has one

71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:18:07.462000+00:00) : high speed data transfer, audio output, video output, video output chaing, rapid power supply, and more
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:17:30.220000+00:00) : thats fucking usb-c the golden standard of ports that everyone should be using and will be in the near future
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:17:15.718000+00:00) : those arent fucking "4 proprietary ports that no one uses"
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T23:17:01.940000+00:00) : can i defend the new macbook for a second
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T13:31:16.895000+00:00) : It's like Nintendo space world which they haven't done since the unveil of the gameboy
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T13:30:54.654000+00:00) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Space_World?wprov=sfla1
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T13:27:31.976000+00:00) : But the difference is that it was a venue at e3 shared by Sony and Microsoft. This is the biggest venue in Japan and it's just them. I'm trying to say this thing is the scale of e3 but just Nintendo
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T13:07:41.788000+00:00) : So the switch presentation is going to be in the largest convention center in Japan and they are renting it out for a full 3 days to not just do announcements but open up demos to the general public. This is the first time Nintendo has presented on stage since 2012, pretty big deal
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T02:06:22.626000+00:00) : https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/791455799302246400

71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T00:39:57.542000+00:00) : might also be able to do it in four years but everyone ive talked to said thats a bad idea
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T00:39:35.723000+00:00) : i might stay an extra semester and get a masters
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T00:37:15.107000+00:00) : still a fine-arts portfolio

71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T00:31:11.065000+00:00) : most of the super heroes are too famous to mingle with random comic book nerds
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T00:30:23.560000+00:00) : that's basically what this comes down to
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T00:30:19.049000+00:00) : keenan would you rather meet reggie or luke cage
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T00:21:36.428000+00:00) : or heavy fog

71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T00:07:43.765000+00:00) : 91.3% screen to body ratio
71716577669550080 (2016-10-27T00:04:00.581000+00:00) : because i dont have 50 pets

71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T21:17:40.149000+00:00) : fuck vr thats the most beautiful computer ive ever seen
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T21:13:22.006000+00:00) : <@!155893986605793281> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzMLA8YIgG0
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T21:13:04.658000+00:00) : keenan
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T18:50:30.134000+00:00) : and that section was the size of the entirety of ocarina of time
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T18:50:13.209000+00:00) : since they only showed us 2% of the map
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T18:49:56.379000+00:00) : well i just hope botw is super expansive and deep at the same time
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T18:48:03.118000+00:00) : but still if you compare it to pokemon or something 7 towns is small
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T18:47:52.826000+00:00) : twilight just has a large map compared to other zelda games
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T18:40:19.889000+00:00) : probably more than 5 like in other zelda games
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T18:39:22.459000+00:00) : but they also didnt show any dungeons or cities or boss battles which is where normally the melodies come from
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T18:39:00.038000+00:00) : judging from the e3 footage, it was mostly ambience
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T18:38:39.527000+00:00) : im pretty sure botw will be like that too
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T18:38:28.852000+00:00) : im fine with that i just actually have to be playing the game not listening to it on its own
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T18:38:14.090000+00:00) : there weren't many melodies
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T18:38:09.369000+00:00) : yeah i noticed that
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T18:37:26.336000+00:00) : which is why breath of the wild is also hype
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T18:37:08.468000+00:00) : the best thing about skyward sword was that it was entirely real orchestra
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T18:35:14.242000+00:00) : from all 180 songs or whatever i think i only added 5 or 6
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T18:34:44.753000+00:00) : on to twilight princess
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T18:34:25.174000+00:00) : tbh skyward sword soundtrack was not that special
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T14:08:09.533000+00:00) : thatd be gaming geared
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T14:08:03.880000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T14:04:22.669000+00:00) : why dont you buy one instead of your life sized statue
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:27:20.218000+00:00) : then VR modeling specialist would be a position in a lot of companies
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:26:04.049000+00:00) : like paint
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:26:02.014000+00:00) : id imagine 3d comics as more loose
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:25:46.856000+00:00) : i feel like strict 3d modeling isnt really good for actual artwork like comics
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:24:40.189000+00:00) : either way its a good starting point to get used to the platform
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:24:23.085000+00:00) : no idea but probably not
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:24:10.051000+00:00) : or see if it exists yet
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:23:59.415000+00:00) : you need to find better software than tiltbrush though
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:23:51.478000+00:00) : keenan you have to make a business out of this
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:23:29.867000+00:00) : you can create 3d hentai
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:23:23.466000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:23:19.727000+00:00) : yea thats what i just said keenan
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:22:30.668000+00:00) : a very early version
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:22:24.961000+00:00) : ive tried an oculus
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:21:48.839000+00:00) : this is literally what valve has been working on for the past 3 years instead of games
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:21:33.624000+00:00) : it's an 800 dollar device
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:20:53.086000+00:00) : thats like asking how is a nintendo switch better for mobile gaming than my phone
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:20:18.116000+00:00) : and you will have been the first
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:20:11.212000+00:00) : because you are the only 3d comic artist
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:20:01.493000+00:00) : and make a living
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:19:49.809000+00:00) : keenan you can be the first 3d comic creator
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:19:26.183000+00:00) : i dont really know how the platform is set up
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:19:12.466000+00:00) : keenan this can be your breakthrough
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:19:00.980000+00:00) : beause it will probably only get cheaper and controllers will get better and more sensitive
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:18:09.644000+00:00) : its still new tech
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:18:01.722000+00:00) : i would still wait
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:15:46.772000+00:00) : yeh
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:15:02.329000+00:00) : its more for painting not modeling
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:14:21.469000+00:00) : it was mostly a proof of concept but google owns it so im sure they will develop it into something better eventually
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:14:00.202000+00:00) : tilt brush is pretty good
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:13:05.304000+00:00) : im trying to look for research applications so i can convince my lab to buy one
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:12:35.337000+00:00) : im bypassing the first gen so they work out whatever kinks there are
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:12:23.181000+00:00) : when the next generation of the vive coes out i might buy one
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:11:33.893000+00:00) : i mean the ones you put your phone in are cheap you just need one that comes with a controller
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:10:49.436000+00:00) : it's called tilt brush and it's just an app that will work with any vr headset
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:09:38.461000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:09:36.656000+00:00) : yeah storage is super cheap
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:08:46.146000+00:00) : daydream
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:08:26.901000+00:00) : i just did because i had it laying around
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:08:21.752000+00:00) : didnt have to upgrade to 16  either
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:08:10.319000+00:00) : i used to use 8 and that was fine
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:08:03.273000+00:00) : no i use 16 though
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:07:55.041000+00:00) : daydream
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:06:52.054000+00:00) : i just dont
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:06:48.871000+00:00) : ronald i can print whatever i want from my lab
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:06:40.564000+00:00) : because when i have time for that i'll have time for figure painting
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:06:22.569000+00:00) : when i build my own 3d printer i'll get into that
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:06:14.495000+00:00) : right now
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:06:11.509000+00:00) : too lazy to get the paint or learn how
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:05:56.375000+00:00) : thats great and when i want a metagross i'll 3d print it
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:05:16.749000+00:00) : keenan there's a certain draw for me of having official things
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:04:51.111000+00:00) : i cant paint
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:04:14.598000+00:00) : this is still cheaper than pokemon cards and infinitely better so im okay with beginning to collect amiibos
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:03:48.840000+00:00) : ugly
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:03:46.745000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:03:35.637000+00:00) : idk
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:03:34.930000+00:00) : or 3
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:03:30.428000+00:00) : maybe i would take up to 2 of the same
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:03:23.868000+00:00) : it has to be unique
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:03:19.237000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:03:01.672000+00:00) : next time i see you keep that in mind
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:02:31.201000+00:00) : if you present me with amiibo, i will probably give you 6 dollars for it no matter what it is
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:01:24.004000+00:00) : stealing them from children?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:01:15.526000+00:00) : toys r us is too far
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:01:09.064000+00:00) : how
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T02:01:00.069000+00:00) : 😦
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:54:47.607000+00:00) : best buy has some sales at like 13 i think
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:54:37.846000+00:00) : 15-20 dollars isnt bad
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:54:20.538000+00:00) : sad thing is amiibos wont die for a while
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:53:46.552000+00:00) : next time i go to best buy
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:53:42.488000+00:00) : or i will get really into them
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:53:35.902000+00:00) : i just need to get really into those
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:53:28.816000+00:00) : honestly im pretty comfortable with amiibos
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:52:12.969000+00:00) : i would pay 700 for a lifesize statue of metagross thats real metal and actually levitates
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:49:41.053000+00:00) : I thought it was plastic
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:49:25.467000+00:00) : Oh wow
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:48:25.888000+00:00) : What's the material
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:44:21.229000+00:00) : Why the fuck is that 700
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:41:42.639000+00:00) : Can I please see a picture of the item I am a gracious investor for?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:38:07.823000+00:00) : Cool I will do that
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:37:52.601000+00:00) : So like 1 day every two years
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:37:36.643000+00:00) : If i give you 1 dollar can I own it for 1/700th of the time
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:30:29.845000+00:00) : Now I feel like you just don't care about my advice lol
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:30:09.892000+00:00) : Not just the computer itself
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:29:56.289000+00:00) : The true cost of a computer often is all the monitors/keyboard/mice/etc that you eventually get with it
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:29:25.715000+00:00) : I mean all those accessories are a really a steal
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:29:00.221000+00:00) : I don't disagree with whatever your reasons are I'm simply saying it's not as good of a deal as you think
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:25:49.960000+00:00) : Exactly. A top of the line card from 2 years ago is equivalent to a mid tier card today and that mid tier card is about the same price
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:24:08.593000+00:00) : With the accessories it's probably worth it but to be honest Ronald built his computer for 600-700 and I think Ronald's is more powerful
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:21:20.116000+00:00) : For your own sake
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:21:16.314000+00:00) : Look I'm pretty sure you're getting a good deal I just want to make sure
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:20:37.934000+00:00) : I don't want to talk about my computer though
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:20:16.713000+00:00) : Considering i spent twice what he did on the graphics card then no
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:19:45.048000+00:00) : I doubt it
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:19:19.337000+00:00) : Since tech improves
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:19:13.505000+00:00) : That's a lot but depending on how old it is you can typically get similar specced stuff for less today
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:18:41.098000+00:00) : It doesn't matter how much he's a geek you really have to know objectively
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:18:05.962000+00:00) : Then how don't you know the specs
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:17:29.183000+00:00) : Trust me you don't want to spend 600 on a computer if you could build a new one with the same specs for less
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:17:04.250000+00:00) : Bro
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:16:58.952000+00:00) : But you don't know that objectively
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:16:22.571000+00:00) : You don't just but a pc without knowing the specs
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:16:11.040000+00:00) : How can you not know
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:15:53.414000+00:00) : What are specs
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:15:16.094000+00:00) : Ooh what's the pc
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:14:19.470000+00:00) : Mai my because I don't understand Japanese
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:14:10.224000+00:00) : If they are Japanese lyrics it can be fine
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:13:37.272000+00:00) : Ok
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:13:11.365000+00:00) : Latter
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:12:28.989000+00:00) : So do I need to add smt4 to my to-do list
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:11:57.528000+00:00) : What kind
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:11:41.228000+00:00) : What's persona 4
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:10:54.189000+00:00) : Ost
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:10:51.098000+00:00) : Is this whole post good?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:10:00.345000+00:00) : If you 8 space it, it will be 57 pages
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:09:06.216000+00:00) : So I was basically right
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:07:59.927000+00:00) : But you removed the hyphen and wrote 57?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:06:07.929000+00:00) : This isn't even a real song but Its so soothing https://youtu.be/pLmuPsmnbJo
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:02:49.578000+00:00) : Just so you know you are always welcome to play mario platformers when i invite you over to my million dollar rooftop parties
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:01:51.854000+00:00) : Where you can't stop playing mario so you just bring it with you
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:01:32.411000+00:00) : Million dollar home rooftop parties
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T01:00:35.983000+00:00) : I just love how Nintendo portrayed that as a thing that normally happens
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:59:13.358000+00:00) : Now Karen is really famous though
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:58:02.322000+00:00) : Well he's part of a VGM band so I'm sure everyone in his life said that to him
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:56:04.542000+00:00) : And by the way it's rubberised and squarish it looks so damn comfortable too
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:55:28.446000+00:00) : But that same guy said he got to hold the pro controller for a while and said it's by far the most comfortable controller
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:54:49.318000+00:00) : There was a Japan team and European team like as role descriptions
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:54:26.513000+00:00) : The European team captain was just his role
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:54:17.108000+00:00) : One of the actors who acted in it did an interview and he explained the whole process
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:53:49.948000+00:00) : It's not
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:53:10.448000+00:00) : No wait Ti is where they get their inspiration for Splatoon esports
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:52:40.798000+00:00) : And is making a dota competitor
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:52:30.010000+00:00) : What if Reggie secretly and been going to every Ti
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:51:41.447000+00:00) : And Nintendo
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:51:32.840000+00:00) : If i got to Seattle i can actually go to TI
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:51:32.727000+00:00) : Fuck
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:48:17.359000+00:00) : Not that it's bad i just can't spend my whole life here
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:48:01.240000+00:00) : Because I'm tired of Bloomington
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:47:50.923000+00:00) : Although I almost certainly won't do grad at IU
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:46:56.447000+00:00) : Unfortunately for me
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:46:43.074000+00:00) : Problem is that IU has a really high ranking cognitive science program
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:44:51.486000+00:00) : For grad school it's not the location it's the faculty there and who you'll be researching with
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:44:24.987000+00:00) : Maybe
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:43:27.346000+00:00) : UNC
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:42:30.498000+00:00) : Look what happened to Ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:42:23.641000+00:00) : Just like we lost Ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:42:19.039000+00:00) : Asher we are going to lose you
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:41:49.264000+00:00) : Lol
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:41:27.188000+00:00) : Or are you helping a sibling
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:41:08.563000+00:00) : Are you applying?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:40:25.022000+00:00) : F stands for fast food
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:39:48.299000+00:00) : Literally any other night i would get fast food with you but I absolutely can't unless you want me to fail my math class
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:37:31.281000+00:00) : I just got home and haven't made any progress
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:36:52.102000+00:00) : And it's starting to interfere with my working ability
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:36:39.731000+00:00) : I check the subreddit 4-5 times a day
71716577669550080 (2016-10-26T00:36:19.264000+00:00) : Keenan i have a real addiction to the Nintendo Switch
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T22:12:46.424000+00:00) : I could get my dad or mom into pokemon by just letting them play my gameboy i guarantee it
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T22:12:22.450000+00:00) : Pokemon Go made it really easy to try
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T22:12:06.969000+00:00) : My theory about pokemon is that everyone would love it if they just tried it
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T22:09:57.881000+00:00) : No pokemon? No sell.
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T22:09:28.823000+00:00) : Welp that pretty much sums that up
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T22:09:18.603000+00:00) : "Ngage attempted to lure gamers away from the GBA. This was unsuccessful."
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T22:06:32.888000+00:00) : It's not just about the phone, also consider the company. I've heard mixed things about oneplus support
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T22:04:44.672000+00:00) : For me I don't think any customization really matters because i always use a case and cases can be customized even further anyway
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T22:03:35.225000+00:00) : Not with images though
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T22:03:25.933000+00:00) : For moto, basically. You can't change it later but you can customize it when you buy
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T22:00:39.806000+00:00) : But of you had to pick between oneplus2 and moto pure i would do moto pure for sure. I just trust Motorola more and you can customize it
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T22:00:04.898000+00:00) : Yeah it you are looking at phones from last year the 6p was the highest rated Android phone.
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T21:56:32.384000+00:00) : And the 6p might go on sale at some point for 300
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T21:56:15.944000+00:00) : The Nexus 5X is also a phone from last year that is around that price
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T21:55:56.125000+00:00) : Moto probably has better customer support. Oneplus is a smaller company. I've had good experience with moto
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T21:54:46.563000+00:00) : Ronald stop texting and driving
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T21:53:07.797000+00:00) : K
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T21:48:47.864000+00:00) : Shh he may never come back
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T21:34:21.287000+00:00) : Yeah chain just fell off. Put it back on in like 10 sec
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T18:17:16.422000+00:00) : You suck at cooking
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T18:16:24.203000+00:00) : The new YSAC is pretty good
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:27:02.040000+00:00) : But I'm also slightly dumb
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:26:55.419000+00:00) : Because i have 35 in ocarina so far
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:26:45.150000+00:00) : Shorter than ocarin
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:26:01.620000+00:00) : It will take at least 40 hours for each of these you knoe
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:25:34.217000+00:00) : Nostalgia in 10 years
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:25:21.101000+00:00) : Fine
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:25:03.092000+00:00) : If you can't even play them
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:24:55.204000+00:00) : Well what's the point of splitting the HD versions then
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:24:04.774000+00:00) : To who
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:23:57.556000+00:00) : Why
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:22:21.424000+00:00) : We can split the HD versions
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:21:52.561000+00:00) : We can do twilight princess though
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:21:42.382000+00:00) : But not for the first time
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:21:27.774000+00:00) : I thought you've already played ss
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:20:49.242000+00:00) : Differently
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:20:41.620000+00:00) : I play games very difficult than you
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:18:25.801000+00:00) : The real work will come when I have to play through all these games before breath of the wild
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:15:20.581000+00:00) : I was hoping to knock skyward sword out in a day
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:15:09.459000+00:00) : Just liek final fantasy
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:15:04.316000+00:00) : That was a week long project
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:14:07.601000+00:00) : This is practically work to listen to
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:12:09.182000+00:00) : Ugh why does the skyward sword soundtrack have to be 6 hours long
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:02:22.356000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:01:03.213000+00:00) : i feel like that would turn into a pretty big waste of water
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T17:00:17.688000+00:00) : with the switch, if my hands are cold, i can put both controllers in my pockets and play from there
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:59:59.323000+00:00) : keenan the future is already here
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:59:15.132000+00:00) : because they were so close
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:59:10.889000+00:00) : actually you could operate both d-pad and the two buttons with one toe
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:58:58.728000+00:00) : well
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:58:47.674000+00:00) : back in the gameboy life was even harder
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:58:30.492000+00:00) : also luckiliy touchscreen pokemon ui's where big enough to operate with a toe
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:58:00.097000+00:00) : luckily pokemon is not that intense
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:57:35.924000+00:00) : cant play it easily with your feet while sitting on the toilet
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:57:24.927000+00:00) : but that was the main problem with the ds
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:57:09.742000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:56:46.532000+00:00) : i can play wit my feet probably
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:56:34.259000+00:00) : thinks about the possibilies keenan
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:55:46.246000+00:00) : that was by far the best thing about the wiimote/nunchuck combo that made it so comfortable
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:55:16.318000+00:00) : but without wires
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:55:05.799000+00:00) : so you're hands dont haeve to be next to each other
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:54:57.177000+00:00) : the fact that you can have half of a controller in each hand

71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:50:59.899000+00:00) : i dont even think he's seen scrubs
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:50:36.717000+00:00) : by new i mean episodes are still cooming out

71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:50:08.656000+00:00) : but there's a new one called "iZombie" which just from the name sounds terrible
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:49:55.550000+00:00) : which some i've heard are good
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:49:46.584000+00:00) : he watches those medical shows too
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:48:51.756000+00:00) : nikhil literally thinks arrow is better than luke cage and/or daredevil
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:47:55.689000+00:00) : it probably still sucks
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:47:37.030000+00:00) : are you talking about the show
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:24:41.069000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T16:24:18.846000+00:00) : what class doesnt let hyou have your laptop
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:51:59.521000+00:00) : "you're hired'
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:51:56.645000+00:00) : "yes"
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:51:53.949000+00:00) : second interview question: "do you own a wii u?"
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:51:15.879000+00:00) : nintendo: "gtfo"
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:50:58.530000+00:00) : "uh i haven't finished that game"
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:50:51.837000+00:00) : first interview question: "what did you think about the final boss in ocarina of time?"
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:48:50.306000+00:00) : then i would be rejected immediately
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:44:01.466000+00:00) : i could just go into R&D
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:43:32.648000+00:00) : i need something where i know about the next games and consoles years before release
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:43:10.591000+00:00) : but that sounds boring
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:43:04.927000+00:00) : i feel like i could do a web managing position fairly easily though
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:42:44.198000+00:00) : the actual game development positions are probably super competitive
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:40:43.860000+00:00) : thats for you
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:40:41.775000+00:00) : Coordinator, Social Media
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:39:55.535000+00:00) : besides the web stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:39:49.331000+00:00) : most of these senior development positions require 5  years experience
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:39:17.601000+00:00) : i could be a translator
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:39:11.548000+00:00) : ugh if only i knew japaneese
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:36:18.214000+00:00) : what do you know...
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:36:15.693000+00:00) : nintendo is hiring a mobile game developer
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:35:40.161000+00:00) : yeah i really want to live there
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:35:14.572000+00:00) : i dont ahve a degree yet
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:35:11.637000+00:00) : well most need degrees
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:34:27.866000+00:00) : maybe not easily
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:34:18.820000+00:00) : dude i could easily get a job at nintendo
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:33:41.478000+00:00) : google hasn't failed me
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:33:36.558000+00:00) : oh good
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:33:21.722000+00:00) : i better get a 1-up from this
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:32:13.852000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:28:25.349000+00:00) : but it's good that they understand the goal of video games is to have fun so even as a billion dollar company they have fun
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:27:27.552000+00:00) : they they fucking murder you
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:26:58.952000+00:00) : i think nintendo's corporate casualness is what makes them so greate
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:25:21.566000+00:00) : this guy is a genius too
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:24:47.998000+00:00) : shit reggie used to do the marketing for pizza hut
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:23:57.392000+00:00) : and they aren't some small indie company either
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:23:42.818000+00:00) : like what other company does that
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:23:32.246000+00:00) : the thing i most like about nintendo is that their execs do stupid skits
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:22:22.332000+00:00) : he's pretty good at determining what mods to buy
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:21:55.577000+00:00) : does gabe actually do development though
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:20:08.659000+00:00) : "hobby is guessing the measurement of objects"
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:19:23.519000+00:00) : "enjoys rearranging the furniture in his house"
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:19:13.238000+00:00) : "semi-professional dog breed"
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:19:01.612000+00:00) : lol his personal life section on wikipedia is hilarious
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:17:49.036000+00:00) : yeah but i dont know how much stan lee actually does either
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:16:34.275000+00:00) : but how much does he actually do in those games
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:16:25.329000+00:00) : im pretty sure he's just listed as creative director/executive producer on everything
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:16:05.200000+00:00) : i dont know how much miyamoto has influence over the games these days
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:13:33.600000+00:00) : i was sad when iwata died but man when miyamoto dies idk what i'll do with my life
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:12:55.228000+00:00) : why does his signature have eyes
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:12:39.832000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:12:26.589000+00:00) : can we talk about miyamoto now
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:11:43.367000+00:00) : even without competition you cant deny that nintendo's handheld line is just good in it's own right
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:10:25.301000+00:00) : and nintendo has always been on top of handheld industry
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:10:15.521000+00:00) : it's ok i forgive Yokoi because he made the gameboy too
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:08:55.942000+00:00) : however if they had the right technology it would have worked
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:08:40.081000+00:00) : and nintendo was even dumber for pushing it to market
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:08:32.930000+00:00) : people in charge of virtual boy were dumb as well by not realizing the technology wasnt there yet until halfway through
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:07:47.097000+00:00) : i could have taken their concept and marketed and engineered a system that actually sold units
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:07:22.329000+00:00) : yeah thats true but the reason the ouya was a bad design idea was because the people at the company were dumb
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:06:48.117000+00:00) : and people have
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:06:42.399000+00:00) : someone could take the idea of virtual realtiy gaming and make a good product too
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:06:29.575000+00:00) : im saying someone could take the idea of a cheap home console that plays android games and turn it into a successful product
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:05:50.464000+00:00) : the idea of a flying machine is good but their design ideas were not good
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:04:39.695000+00:00) : i mean he has boobs in his signature
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:03:52.556000+00:00) : can we talk about how cool miyamoto is
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:01:29.728000+00:00) : but no you have to be dumb
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:01:16.383000+00:00) : YEAH ME TOO
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:00:48.119000+00:00) : just because halway through you realize what you made is bad doesnt mean tht eomotivation was bad
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T14:00:29.472000+00:00) : my definition of idea is the initial motivation behind the system
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:59:28.940000+00:00) : *idea*
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:58:28.225000+00:00) : not the virtual boy
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:58:24.199000+00:00) : and part of the reason it may have done that is because it was nintendo's primary focus
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:57:23.292000+00:00) : and it was more like 3.5 years
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:56:52.040000+00:00) : not 1 year
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:56:49.303000+00:00) : which is more usual of a console gap
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:56:40.845000+00:00) : and the time between gba and ds was 3 years
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:54:58.140000+00:00) : ugh keenan
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:53:47.446000+00:00) : considering they had a team working on the 64 concurrently, and that miyamoto had no involvement with the system, the virtual boy was definitely not meant to be a next gen console between the snes and n64
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:52:16.107000+00:00) : and the final console wasnt even intended for release
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:51:46.916000+00:00) : also wikipedia clearly says the virtual boy was an experiment
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:51:10.386000+00:00) : keenan find me a source that says the n64 was supposed to have virtualboy compatibility
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:48:42.847000+00:00) : im saying that because the n64 came literally a year after it, meaning they were probably working on the n64 long before the virtual boy came out
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:48:17.378000+00:00) : im not saying that because it failed
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:47:27.621000+00:00) : it was just a thing on a the side
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:47:22.205000+00:00) : the virtual boy was obviously not meant to be the "next gen" nintendo console
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:47:01.205000+00:00) : yes keenan which is why they released the n64 one year later
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:46:48.224000+00:00) : ok keenan you can argue thats it's not VR when literally all the media and marketing surrounding it referred to the virtual boy as VR
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:45:29.626000+00:00) : uhuh
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:43:13.142000+00:00) : what did i just say
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:43:09.569000+00:00) : ....
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:42:53.075000+00:00) : back then that was pretty much VR
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:42:43.188000+00:00) : keenan our definition of VR has changed as we got better technology
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:42:22.215000+00:00) : and that it's a headset and personalized display
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:41:40.640000+00:00) : it's as much VR as they could get it back then
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:41:18.297000+00:00) : i highgly doubt they were close to going bankrupt or anything
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:39:08.241000+00:00) : "someday this will be great, but lets just see what happens if we try to do it now"
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:38:51.297000+00:00) : i have a feeling nintendo knew that too which is why it was more of an experiment
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:38:09.920000+00:00) : turns out thats a pretty good idea
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:38:02.339000+00:00) : VR gaming
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:37:26.612000+00:00) : even if back in the 90s it didnt show it
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:37:20.042000+00:00) : the concept of virtual boy also proved to be successful
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:37:08.324000+00:00) : the concept for ouya proved successful
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:36:59.130000+00:00) : i just said if executed better it could have been good
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:36:40.702000+00:00) : i never said it did
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:34:46.514000+00:00) : i dont know you tell me, you said so yourself
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:34:10.020000+00:00) : i think you lost this argument
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:33:39.718000+00:00) : which is why it got 8.5million funding
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:33:32.557000+00:00) : keenan i dont know why you dont see that their concept was perfectly fine
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:32:49.382000+00:00) : "ouya is a good idea if done right" -keenan
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:32:19.029000+00:00) : and when executed properly, they could have succeeded
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:31:54.498000+00:00) : im arguing that they're not
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:31:51.190000+00:00) : you started off this conversation with ouya is a bad idea and virtual boy is a bad idea
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:31:30.764000+00:00) : how is that relevant
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:31:26.044000+00:00) : ok?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:30:59.933000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:30:33.822000+00:00) : yes but not because they were bad ideas
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:30:08.125000+00:00) : just like virtual boy was
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:30:01.694000+00:00) : thats what ive been trying to say keenan
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:29:34.662000+00:00) : there's a difference between bad idea and bad execution
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:28:28.798000+00:00) : doesnt make it a bad idea
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:28:06.606000+00:00) : they knew it was good idea the tech wasnt there yet
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:27:35.567000+00:00) : considering where VR is now i'd say they pretty accurately predicted the future
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:26:50.482000+00:00) : the virtual boy was nintendo having enough money to fuck around for a bit and try something crazy
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:25:26.923000+00:00) : hence why people bought it
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:25:22.868000+00:00) : but still appealing if you make it cheap enough
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:25:15.206000+00:00) : ouya is a lot worse than thsoe comparitively
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:24:28.347000+00:00) : i dont think either of those ideas were bad keenan
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:22:48.739000+00:00) : considering the asking price was 99 i think it could have worked if they weren't idiots
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T13:20:18.607000+00:00) : their ceo was truly an idiot
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T09:37:48.498000+00:00) : This is funny https://youtu.be/xTqhyHuKVKA

71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T09:14:00.071000+00:00) : The pokemon meta needs to reward people for thinking outside the box more
71716577669550080 (2016-10-25T09:13:37.310000+00:00) : Didn't we used to have that guy who won with non traditional teams
71716577669550080 (2016-10-24T23:47:39.033000+00:00) : And not like small games either. Feel like an idiot
71716577669550080 (2016-10-24T23:46:38.166000+00:00) : Lol i just learned that Bethesda makes games other than the elder scrolls and fallout
71716577669550080 (2016-10-24T02:17:24.495000+00:00) : not even as joke but it would just be his normal voice
71716577669550080 (2016-10-24T02:17:06.494000+00:00) : i hope he sings like k.k. too

71716577669550080 (2016-10-22T04:40:09.487000+00:00) : extreme self discipline

71716577669550080 (2016-10-22T02:05:45.222000+00:00) : then i would sell it on ebay as a leaked model
71716577669550080 (2016-10-22T02:05:10.411000+00:00) : mine would look beautiful of course
71716577669550080 (2016-10-22T02:05:03.729000+00:00) : it was hilariously bad but it's totally something i would do if i had the time or the foam
71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T22:25:30.219000+00:00) : this mockup gets more and more hilarious the more you scroll down https://imgur.com/a/4meRW

71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T20:42:35.693000+00:00) : that joke actually makes sense for the switch
71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T20:41:15.461000+00:00) : Why is the Nintendo Switch called a Switch? Because you do a Switch and then walk away.
71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T20:16:07.853000+00:00) : WOW HOW DOES IT ALREADY HAVE 11 MILLION VIEWS

71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T20:10:49.958000+00:00) : i dont think it was designed that way
71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T20:09:35.801000+00:00) : what that she can be the best in the world and stillget all her homework done?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T20:09:02.215000+00:00) : maybe it enhances their authenticity but not their quality
71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T20:08:41.385000+00:00) : uh huh
71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T20:08:09.708000+00:00) : not amazing

71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T20:06:50.975000+00:00) : ashley is the best song in that series

71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T20:02:17.782000+00:00) : like once every 3 years
71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T20:02:09.833000+00:00) : nintendo should release real K.K. Slider albums on itunes or something
71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T20:01:08.173000+00:00) : it's really bothering me because some parts literally sound like he's blowing his nose on purpose as part of the song
71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T20:00:38.333000+00:00) : I can't tell if K.K. Slider does some acapella or the midi isn't high enough quality to distinguish between instrument and voice
71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T19:23:15.743000+00:00) : yeah i'll probably explode if i dont play anything tonight
71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T17:30:27.989000+00:00) : what do you think?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T16:33:22.796000+00:00) : and there's a ton of information in it too
71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T16:20:55.527000+00:00) : omg gamexplain literally made an 11 minute analysis video based on the 6 seconds of mario footage on the NS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFGAJtnky7A
71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T16:16:46.231000+00:00) : the song that birthed your axolotls
71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T10:11:32.781000+00:00) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X23Fzs1QBZA <@!155893986605793281> was this it?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T09:56:39.134000+00:00) : im entirely relying on pokemon to save me from the fact that we wont get more NS news until next year
71716577669550080 (2016-10-21T00:19:46.558000+00:00) : too much work
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T22:21:44.492000+00:00) : so the extra price can go to things that actually matter
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T22:21:34.207000+00:00) : the NS doesn't seem like it has a camera or a touchscreen which seems like a good thing
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T22:06:56.896000+00:00) : hope it's not just pikapark 2 or some shit
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T22:06:38.762000+00:00) : looks like the ceo of the pokemon company confirmed pokemon games on NS
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T22:04:27.032000+00:00) : i cant
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T20:33:52.248000+00:00) : Exactly
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T20:10:27.960000+00:00) : As a half parody
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T20:10:02.089000+00:00) : You should get into a huge Facebook debate with him like people do with politics
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T20:07:08.381000+00:00) : I want to see
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T20:04:25.433000+00:00) : Keenan come to class today so I can see you
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:31:09.590000+00:00) : we can only go off personal experience
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:30:36.496000+00:00) : i feel like none of us really know enough about how game servers work to really be debating this
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:27:38.605000+00:00) : thats not how it works keenan
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:27:30.064000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:27:27.459000+00:00) : but they are functional tablets
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:26:55.745000+00:00) : they are like 50 bucks
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:26:50.423000+00:00) : have you seen the latest kindle fires
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:24:54.564000+00:00) : like if i host an aoe lobby it might be running the server off of my computer
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:24:29.398000+00:00) : because its only like 4-8 player
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:24:24.361000+00:00) : those smaller online games are probably just hosted on someones computer
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:24:05.659000+00:00) : age of empires isnt that problematic
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:23:23.172000+00:00) : or the developer is big enough like activision for call of duty
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:23:10.140000+00:00) : but in my experience they've all had good servers
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:23:01.893000+00:00) : sure
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:22:29.353000+00:00) : the onlny thing i can think of that's really popular is civ
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:22:12.428000+00:00) : wow?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:21:58.527000+00:00) : or what game do people really play online on steam that isn't a valve game
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:21:39.263000+00:00) : but honestly what online steam game has bad servers
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:21:14.237000+00:00) : except for valve games of course
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:21:08.128000+00:00) : in the case of steam i think developers host them
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:20:22.494000+00:00) : games on steams use their own servers for online too
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:20:13.844000+00:00) : i dont think you understand
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:19:30.639000+00:00) : well then you're wrong
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:19:14.919000+00:00) : and nintendo network which is worse
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:19:02.572000+00:00) : whcih is better
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:18:59.535000+00:00) : the only other free ones are steam
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:18:52.487000+00:00) : other free ones
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:18:41.595000+00:00) : but a free service doesnt have to be shit either
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:18:27.721000+00:00) : well yeah because they want people to think that their money is going towards a quality service
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:17:48.170000+00:00) : and more people with kindles means more people buying books  or apps from their store
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:17:25.010000+00:00) : they sell them at a loss but then expect that you'll use their online stores
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:17:09.589000+00:00) : because amazon does that with the kindles
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:16:59.376000+00:00) : i honestly think psn and xbox live have a subscription not to help pay for servers but so sony and microsoft can make a profit off of selling their hardware at a low price
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:16:00.077000+00:00) : cant argue with that logic
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:15:48.418000+00:00) : ok you win
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:15:18.292000+00:00) : and you dont have to pay for servers
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:15:13.360000+00:00) : steam has good online
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:14:09.087000+00:00) : keenan how can we trust you when you dont even have a functioning ps4
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:13:19.934000+00:00) : well they might already use ads idk
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:13:13.214000+00:00) : because without a subscription they might have to use ads to make a profit
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:12:45.244000+00:00) : i think part o the reason there's a subscription is the make the initial cost of the hardware lower
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:11:37.168000+00:00) : convencience is also a factor
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:11:05.748000+00:00) : the only advantage of an xbox one over a traditional PC is that it's cheaper
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:10:43.143000+00:00) : xbox games are released on steam
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:10:17.905000+00:00) : but microsoft is already heading in that direction
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:10:05.427000+00:00) : it would not be on discs
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:09:54.259000+00:00) : people buy ps4s and xboxs because they dont want to spend a lot of a good PC and they want a modern library
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:09:17.113000+00:00) : not good enough to the point where it's why people buy their consoles
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:08:22.745000+00:00) : all the best exclusive ps4 games are also on xbox and by third parties
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:08:01.290000+00:00) : but when you think of sony you dont think of game developers
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:07:50.616000+00:00) : sony could definitely make exclusive ps4 games
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:07:15.079000+00:00) : just because they are amazing at making games
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:07:07.982000+00:00) : and they would still get tons of sales
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:06:59.108000+00:00) : like nintendo could have the shittiest graphics and shittiest online capability
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:06:31.670000+00:00) : because the games are always the reason people buy nintendo stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:06:20.400000+00:00) : i think sony and microsoft really just need to make more first party exclusive games
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:05:28.284000+00:00) : i feel like now would be a really good time to invest in nintendo
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:04:51.268000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:04:11.554000+00:00) : RONALD FOCUS
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:03:37.125000+00:00) : i dont understand how sony and microsoft are going to make a successful new console without using the same exact concept of the NS
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:02:11.362000+00:00) : thats always been my strategy. buy a nintendo console since it has the most exclusives and then use a PC for every other game
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:00:31.068000+00:00) : the wii u really doesnt though
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:00:18.219000+00:00) : except the the wii had pretty good third party support just because it was the most popular console at the time
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T18:00:00.750000+00:00) : yeah ever since the wii nintendo has had problems with third party support
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:59:12.711000+00:00) : well first of all in 2006 this technology wasnt there yet
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:58:17.691000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:57:04.016000+00:00) : when does skyrim hd come out?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:56:10.689000+00:00) : and you dont think they can do the same for any other console?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:55:28.609000+00:00) : ronald how does a ps4 run skyrim
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:55:22.644000+00:00) : i think it will get tthe fallout games, the only reason they showed skyrim was because skyrim hd is the going to be the most recent bethesda game
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:53:21.385000+00:00) : ps4 probably still has better graphics
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:52:20.603000+00:00) : yeah why not
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:51:26.298000+00:00) : it's sometimes even referred to GBA "Skyrim edition"
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:51:11.807000+00:00) : thats literally all it is
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:51:07.835000+00:00) : its just a gameboy advance that plays skyrim
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:50:47.555000+00:00) : ronald imagine the gameboy advanced
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:50:02.430000+00:00) : ronald now you can play skyrim while you're pooping
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:45:35.527000+00:00) : this is some crazy cyclical shit
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:45:00.371000+00:00) : i wonder if when the joycons are attached if the pad will have more battery life than when it's just a tablet
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:44:16.075000+00:00) : the pad you will be holding has three separate battery packs
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:43:46.136000+00:00) : there are so many batteries
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:39:34.378000+00:00) : great.
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:39:24.843000+00:00) : the AXYB do seem kind of large
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:37:58.424000+00:00) : nintendo invented buttons
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:37:52.862000+00:00) : but keenan
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:37:34.653000+00:00) : like come on
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:37:30.634000+00:00) : nintendo doesnt ever fuck up buttons
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:37:24.125000+00:00) : i feel like buttons are pretty easy to change
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:36:54.668000+00:00) : in the wii u reveal trailer the gamepad had flat circle pads instead of real analog sticks
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:36:28.781000+00:00) : a lot of it might not be finalized
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:34:32.918000+00:00) : the pro controller not the joycon one
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:34:24.332000+00:00) : i hope that square controller is comfortable
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:33:58.649000+00:00) : because the normal pro controller is sort of squarish this time
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:33:23.659000+00:00) : its the first thing i noticed
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:33:15.504000+00:00) : yeah the controller does
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:32:42.728000+00:00) : in the future i'll be playing dota with a Joy-con
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:31:24.941000+00:00) : theres a reason they got off that one pretty quick
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:30:30.299000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:29:09.831000+00:00) : well i mean the nes controller was the first dpad so theres that
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:28:24.859000+00:00) : i mean the nes and snes controller
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:27:54.544000+00:00) : nintendo hasnt innovated this hard since they invented the modern gaming controller
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:26:48.517000+00:00) : but what technology is nintendo whopping out of their ass that does this
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:26:35.886000+00:00) : i understand one thing is designed for gaming and the other is not
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:26:02.727000+00:00) : why cant it play skyrim
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:25:59.123000+00:00) : like my phone costed 500 bucks
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:25:47.063000+00:00) : i still cant believe they can fit these huge games like botw and skyrim on what is practically a tablet with nvidia tegra graphics
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:24:49.764000+00:00) : true it would be a direct thing
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:23:55.727000+00:00) : since it's not a direct connection
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:23:48.888000+00:00) : it depends too much on your internet connection
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:23:32.586000+00:00) : steam home streaming also scuks
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:22:54.971000+00:00) : and keep it at a low price
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:22:42.486000+00:00) : the fact that it sucked on the vita makes me think it is not a "pretty easy" thing to do
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:21:05.951000+00:00) : but input would be considerably delayed
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:20:57.213000+00:00) : like watching netflix on a chromecast
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:20:51.541000+00:00) : it would be good for viewing
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:20:47.074000+00:00) : i cant imagine that would be low latency enough to play
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:20:11.318000+00:00) : not the other way around
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:20:07.418000+00:00) : the ps4 streamed to the vita
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:19:58.617000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:19:03.726000+00:00) : k boy
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:19:00.566000+00:00) : "pretty easy"
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:11:57.771000+00:00) : and the base station may just boost it up when plugged in
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:11:43.569000+00:00) : or if it's all in the gamepad
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:11:33.482000+00:00) : i cant tell if there is a separate graphics driver in the gamepad and the base station
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:11:16.210000+00:00) : did you read this? https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/10/20/nintendo-switch/
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:10:37.145000+00:00) : but im pretty sure it cant because the base station probably uses the internals of the game pad to run
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:10:02.179000+00:00) : stuff like that
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:09:56.694000+00:00) : like im wondering if you can do that on NS
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:09:51.165000+00:00) : completely independent of each other
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:09:42.932000+00:00) : where one person uses game pad and other person uses tv
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:09:34.807000+00:00) : games like splatoon have 1 on 1 mode
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:08:47.502000+00:00) : the touchpad is extremely useful in pikmin 3
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:08:35.163000+00:00) : i haven't played all of the first party games onthe wii u but im sure nintendo has cclever mechanics built in for some of them
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:06:53.833000+00:00) : you can buy any of those games separately
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:06:40.641000+00:00) : well they are
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:06:12.169000+00:00) : of the game
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:06:10.189000+00:00) : thats the whole point
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:06:05.115000+00:00) : they dont
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:05:58.730000+00:00) : yes keenan for nnintendo land they specifically designed concepts that use the gamepad in creative ways
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:05:29.180000+00:00) : it is mandatory for those types of gamess
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:05:18.881000+00:00) : people noted that the inklings look different
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:05:10.702000+00:00) : no it could be a sequel
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:04:51.185000+00:00) : some of the party games like nintendo land and mario party and others no doubt use it
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:04:33.781000+00:00) : certain mechanics in the super mario bros U allow a player with the touchpad to build things while other people play
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:04:07.810000+00:00) : but it's not mandatory
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:04:03.485000+00:00) : well its nice to have an inventory and stuff on the bottom screen while you play on the top screen
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:03:05.789000+00:00) : because im pretty sure you cant use the screen and play on the tv at the same time
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T17:02:18.656000+00:00) : i dont think it will be backwayds compatable with wii u
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:57:54.636000+00:00) : i just like having them
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:57:51.062000+00:00) : even if i wouldn't play them
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:57:45.452000+00:00) : although it's really hard for me refrain from buying every single retro console from gameworld
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:57:31.097000+00:00) : especially new hardware
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:57:00.989000+00:00) : well im abnormally obsessed about hardware
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:55:57.493000+00:00) : but you did buy the 3ds near launch
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:55:03.105000+00:00) : when the 3ds was announced i kept it as a wallpaper from e3 until it was released
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:54:36.705000+00:00) : i need to find a good NS wallpaper
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:53:37.913000+00:00) : cool
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:53:19.669000+00:00) : better than most trailers
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:53:12.612000+00:00) : that trailer was pretty good too
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:51:47.529000+00:00) : sinces you know he regens
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:51:43.476000+00:00) : but wolf man still lives
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:51:39.302000+00:00) : when everyone dies
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:51:36.515000+00:00) : it seems like in the future
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:51:29.958000+00:00) : this isn't the origin story right?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:50:17.476000+00:00) : because normally trailers aren't that interesting to me
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:50:09.453000+00:00) : i dont see any other reasons why a trailer would have that much hype
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:49:58.136000+00:00) : wait did no one expect this movie or something?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:48:58.346000+00:00) : 6. RDR2

71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:48:35.813000+00:00) : im pretty sure people watched that trailer
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:48:30.765000+00:00) : keenan have you seen r/all?

71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:44:37.122000+00:00) : i feel bad for the moderators of r/gaming
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T16:42:26.818000+00:00) : people carry tablets around all the time

71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:14:46.594000+00:00) : no joke
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:14:28.682000+00:00) : if they only made one game for it and that game was called breath of the wild i would still buy it day one
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:14:11.231000+00:00) : asher it already has a good lineup

71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:11:11.404000+00:00) : and joy con's cant be that expensive
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:10:59.702000+00:00) : im kind of worried about that but nintendo has always made high quality hardware
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:09:30.506000+00:00) : maybe if you jam it in real hard
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:09:12.678000+00:00) : the game card slot looks like it could fit a 3ds cartridge
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:08:42.398000+00:00) : I CANT THINK ABOUT THAT NOW
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:08:33.226000+00:00) : STOP
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:08:21.096000+00:00) : and i have so much work to do

71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:07:29.035000+00:00) : i mean the 3ds is only 5 hours when playing 3ds games
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:07:11.592000+00:00) : like airplane rides
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:07:09.067000+00:00) : and the battery will be sure long enough to last you anywhere there aren't outlets
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:06:52.380000+00:00) : wall outlets are plentiful
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:06:35.180000+00:00) : if all you have to carry with you to play skyrim on the go is a charger i wont care
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:06:01.830000+00:00) : literally my only dream
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:05:48.437000+00:00) : it's the fact that you can play them on mobile
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:05:39.967000+00:00) : the best part isnt skyrim or breath of the wild
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:05:30.709000+00:00) : UGH
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:05:24.643000+00:00) : keenan

71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:04:53.711000+00:00) : hell, smartwatches these days are 350
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:04:37.271000+00:00) : the wii u was initially 350
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:04:27.300000+00:00) : wasnt the ps4 initiall 400
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:04:17.533000+00:00) : where can i find screenshot of skyrim on it
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:03:38.487000+00:00) : since he wont buy one
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:03:32.008000+00:00) : and then each give one of the Joy-cons to ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:03:21.829000+00:00) : we should all buy one
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:02:39.281000+00:00) : because kids
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:02:25.573000+00:00) : thats the only reason their online is dumbed down a bit
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:02:08.361000+00:00) : the fact that everyrone in the trailer is like over 25 kind of makes me think nintendo will have more of a mature online platform
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:00:46.810000+00:00) : you dont see people gathering around an ipad with controllers playing shit
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:00:33.194000+00:00) : i dont think people are ready for that
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:00:11.615000+00:00) : can you imagine that in real llife?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T15:00:01.430000+00:00) : look at that image of the four people playing NBA with the half controllers

71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T14:59:40.497000+00:00) : online will be at least as good as the wii u which isn't bad
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T14:59:23.877000+00:00) : but dude can you imagine
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T14:59:03.246000+00:00) : you might say your body is ready for this but really this is too much innovation to handle

71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T13:57:46.639000+00:00) : nintendo could at least start the stream and just display a static image so we know it's at least working

71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:50:09.316000+00:00) : cargo pants/shorts only make up like 40% of my pants but they are useful

71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:41:12.477000+00:00) : but i just like new devices
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:41:07.694000+00:00) : because really it should be the games
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:41:03.522000+00:00) : dont know why
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:40:56.494000+00:00) : hardware is always the thing im most hyped for
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:34:07.656000+00:00) : i cant remember the last time there was a hardware reveal that i was expecting to happen soon where some info wasn't leaked before
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:33:40.088000+00:00) : anyway
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:33:29.749000+00:00) : so i dont know if it really matters
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:33:24.998000+00:00) : but in japan people will go to sleep and have the whole next day
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:33:09.458000+00:00) : i guess then you have the whole day for people to read the news
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:32:29.820000+00:00) : it will last 3 minutes then im booking it
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:32:14.768000+00:00) : so keenan call at 10?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:31:44.770000+00:00) : because i have a meeting at 10
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:31:39.179000+00:00) : nope
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:30:57.974000+00:00) : but 11pm japan is
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:30:53.767000+00:00) : because 10am EST is definittely not ideal
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:30:46.351000+00:00) : well im pretty sure nintendo plans their shit around the ideal time for japan
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:27:35.930000+00:00) : that cant be a coincidence
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:27:29.206000+00:00) : because the rdr2 trailer comes out literally an hour after the nx trailer
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:26:52.353000+00:00) : what if it's a launch title
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:26:46.050000+00:00) : shiiiiit
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:26:28.007000+00:00) : what if
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:26:26.763000+00:00) : shit...
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:26:07.208000+00:00) : and general hype
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:26:05.236000+00:00) : but the media coverage of the nx will by far overwhelm it
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:24:02.157000+00:00) : i bet rockstar is saying "well shit" right now
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:20:19.665000+00:00) : or they will be watching it in their office and be secretly hoping im late
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:19:53.530000+00:00) : im meeting with an IT team at the undergraduate education office and last time I met with them they seemed like decently nerdy people so i bet there's a chance they'll be watching it too
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:19:03.274000+00:00) : yeah it will still be going on tomorrow morning so it's a valid excuse
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:17:34.706000+00:00) : "rain"
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:16:12.566000+00:00) : ok apparently the trailer will only be 3 minutes long so i can just be late to my meeting and watch it live
71716577669550080 (2016-10-20T01:11:30.584000+00:00) : i cant believe i have a meeting at 10 and a class directly after at 11

71716577669550080 (2016-10-18T01:12:59.209000+00:00) : back in the primaries when there were candidates that i liked and candidates that ronald liked we would have long political discussions about it
71716577669550080 (2016-10-18T01:11:03.869000+00:00) : but it definitely has something to do with the fact i cant bring myself to make any facebook post

71716577669550080 (2016-10-17T01:29:18.675000+00:00) : you  should be able to at least do the partial run though right?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-17T01:28:48.646000+00:00) : well one of the endingsis a result of  doing genocide

71716577669550080 (2016-10-16T23:48:27.153000+00:00) : but that game is designed to be difficult to 100%, not difficult to beat
71716577669550080 (2016-10-16T23:43:26.438000+00:00) : the downside of that is that game overs dont mean anything

71716577669550080 (2016-10-16T21:49:29.144000+00:00) : yes
71716577669550080 (2016-10-16T21:46:23.875000+00:00) : yeah the only good faceplate on nintendo's official site is this one https://store.nintendo.com/ng3/us/po/browse/productDetailColorSizePicker.jsp?categoryNav=true&navAction=jump&navCount=0&atg.multisite.remap=false&productId=prod780384&categoryId=cat600792

71716577669550080 (2016-10-16T21:43:09.423000+00:00) : but it should have been white instead of yellow

71716577669550080 (2016-10-14T00:10:42.219000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2016-10-13T23:35:08.609000+00:00) : at the same time im kind of skeptical that it will be  real handheld since they said breath of the wild will be on the nx and that does not look like it could be a handheld game at all
71716577669550080 (2016-10-13T23:31:18.261000+00:00) : hopefully the nx is a handheld that is more modern in terms of specs like phones
71716577669550080 (2016-10-13T23:31:01.090000+00:00) : also the 3ds line is over 5 years old now, and even though it was released in 2011 it has a really low resolution screen, which i was always dissappointed about
71716577669550080 (2016-10-13T23:29:42.043000+00:00) : also i just think nintendo handhelds are their best product
71716577669550080 (2016-10-13T23:23:17.228000+00:00) : i really hope it's a handheld

71716577669550080 (2016-10-13T19:20:58.066000+00:00) : you only need discrete math, calc 2, and data structures as prerequisites!

71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:46:05.680000+00:00) : three controllers would be pretty nice i'll admit
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:45:56.910000+00:00) : how much do you care about the ps4
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:44:05.280000+00:00) : have you tried kicking it
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:43:55.301000+00:00) : that plugs into the back
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:43:48.440000+00:00) : but it still has a power supply cord
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:43:03.457000+00:00) : thats what happened to my wifi router

71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:41:30.742000+00:00) : ive heard of graphics card companies sending you the latest version of the card when the old one is faulty
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:40:50.067000+00:00) : can you get that new model
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:40:10.118000+00:00) : huh
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:39:43.603000+00:00) : i think by giving them 125 you are admitting defeat and doing exactly the shit they want you to do
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:39:25.984000+00:00) : can you extend the warranty
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:39:16.046000+00:00) : <:sadboy:230133848740986891>
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:38:47.636000+00:00) : why do they need a 125 service fee
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:38:41.668000+00:00) : is it not under warranty
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:38:02.844000+00:00) : or did they just say theycan do it
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:37:56.236000+00:00) : i mean did they say what the problem was at all so you could find someone else to fix it or fix it yourself
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:37:36.389000+00:00) : did they say they can fiz it
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:36:06.311000+00:00) : how do you know it's really broken
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:35:27.219000+00:00) : i might this thanksgiving or winter break
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:33:04.838000+00:00) : such as twilight princess
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:33:00.284000+00:00) : to play a console zelda game
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:32:54.621000+00:00) : it inspires me
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:32:49.932000+00:00) : im listening to the soundtrack now
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:32:15.056000+00:00) : but im thinking it might actually be good
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:32:07.895000+00:00) : everyone says its not as good as the other games
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:31:45.847000+00:00) : oh ok
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:31:22.578000+00:00) : why only 4 hours
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:30:24.680000+00:00) : why
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:30:04.390000+00:00) : keenan how much did you play twilight princess
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:29:29.017000+00:00) : 😦
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:14:07.513000+00:00) : he bought them all
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:13:16.031000+00:00) : he's a very shady man
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:13:11.450000+00:00) : literally all the information online about him is related to secret

71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:10:34.517000+00:00) : exactly
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:10:23.406000+00:00) : yeah i know
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:09:51.752000+00:00) : literally just a turkish guy who got all his wealth from his father's company and who's greatest accomplishment is being the #1 clash of clans player
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:07:48.362000+00:00) : lol some people are speculating that secret is a giant money laundering scheme https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/56ollv/serious_is_team_secret_a_money_laundering_scheme/
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:07:01.211000+00:00) : kemal is a bad owner but im sure a larger portion of why it got so bad was puppey
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:03:15.348000+00:00) : also they always got other swedish people
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:02:55.684000+00:00) : there was only one year out of the 4 years of alliance where they had different people than normal
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:01:14.245000+00:00) : and you hated alliance
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T23:01:11.090000+00:00) : ronald alliance was one of the few teams that had that sense
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:41:56.088000+00:00) : i bet puppey doesnt play pubs because he has legit anger management issues
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:41:12.663000+00:00) : this wasnt for np it was for secret
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:33:22.494000+00:00) : doesnt seem that hard to not be terrible
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:33:17.198000+00:00) : we should start an esports org
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:32:39.347000+00:00) : and just use office space for bootcamps
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:32:31.768000+00:00) : im pretty sure all the top orgs pay salaries
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:28:38.082000+00:00) : and dendi
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:28:30.477000+00:00) : and xboct
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:26:58.771000+00:00) : but if puppey/secret doesnt make any statement to clear things up, no one will want to play with secret or puppey ever again
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:26:38.376000+00:00) : no idea why pieliedie stayed in the first place
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:26:27.970000+00:00) : i bet mp forev and midone want out
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:25:01.724000+00:00) : otherwise you might have to pay for housing for the players as well as an office space
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:24:39.420000+00:00) : but if you think about it, especially for smaller organizations, team houses are a really good deal because it consolidates living arangements and practice space
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:23:49.568000+00:00) : i tihnk the bigger orgs like eg or liquid dont have houses they have office space basically for bootcamping
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:22:09.253000+00:00) : secret really is the exception
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:22:04.162000+00:00) : but there are so many other high quality orgs out there
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:21:51.808000+00:00) : the players also were dumb for agreeing to play for secret without creal contracts
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:21:28.966000+00:00) : because secret is a terrible organization run by an attention-seeking greedy idiot
71716577669550080 (2016-10-09T22:19:56.959000+00:00) : they were colleagues

71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T01:03:52.755000+00:00) : i think you're forgetting that the super hero has abilities and the other people dont

71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T01:02:11.737000+00:00) : if the japanese guy fighting the YEEHAW group had super powers i think he would win too regardless of if he was using non-native fighting tactics to him or not
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T01:00:39.109000+00:00) : because the other ninjas dont have super senses
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T01:00:07.836000+00:00) : every show uses characters of ethnicity to represent villians

71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:55:56.010000+00:00) : if they give all the super heroes the same power

71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:53:52.772000+00:00) : jessica is practically obsolete
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:53:35.930000+00:00) : i think you're kidding me

71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:52:39.813000+00:00) : 50 tons is a lot of tons
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:52:36.570000+00:00) : keenan
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:52:04.711000+00:00) : the most jessica ever did was take some pictures and lift up a car
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:51:50.872000+00:00) : and used it as a weapon
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:51:47.045000+00:00) : ripped out a random pipe
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:51:42.222000+00:00) : luke cage punched a hole in the wall
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:51:32.703000+00:00) : dude
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:51:28.511000+00:00) : even mr. incredible was shown lifting train cars as weights
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:51:10.595000+00:00) : did they never show jessica doing anything cool
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:50:57.888000+00:00) : then why
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:48:17.277000+00:00) : and im sure luke cage could "fly" by jumping just like jessica if he tried
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:47:32.164000+00:00) : im pretty sure the strongest thing she did was pick up a car
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:47:05.881000+00:00) : jessica never did anything that strong in her show
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:46:44.555000+00:00) : according to his origin story he got super strength and unbreakable skin
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:46:03.067000+00:00) : he can throw couches or rip car doors off and clean up giant building rubble
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:45:37.294000+00:00) : it seems like he does
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:45:16.339000+00:00) : whats so special about jessica jones's strength if luke cage has the same strength but also has unbreakable skin
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:44:43.218000+00:00) : answer my question about luke cage
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:44:23.564000+00:00) : keenan
71716577669550080 (2016-10-07T00:44:01.790000+00:00) : MacCookie69
71716577669550080 (2016-10-06T23:26:45.844000+00:00) : ?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-06T23:26:18.176000+00:00) : But seriously how isn't luke cage just a better version of Jessica Jones
71716577669550080 (2016-10-06T23:24:05.637000+00:00) : He's bald
71716577669550080 (2016-10-06T23:24:02.179000+00:00) : Fuck you're right
71716577669550080 (2016-10-06T22:43:08.135000+00:00) : what separates him from jessica jones's super strength
71716577669550080 (2016-10-06T22:42:55.249000+00:00) : and he picked up a couch and swung it around
71716577669550080 (2016-10-06T22:42:44.168000+00:00) : but he literally just punched a hole in a wall and and ripped out a pipe to use as a weapon
71716577669550080 (2016-10-06T22:42:29.291000+00:00) : like i know he unbreakable skin and shit

71716577669550080 (2016-10-06T14:58:14.560000+00:00) : because jesse eisenberg is literally zuckerberg
71716577669550080 (2016-10-06T14:58:03.488000+00:00) : yeah i think he did a good job at showing what if zuckerberg was a supervillian
71716577669550080 (2016-10-06T14:55:22.406000+00:00) : because thats literally not how batman v superman showed him
71716577669550080 (2016-10-06T14:55:09.961000+00:00) : frank underwood?
71716577669550080 (2016-10-06T14:55:02.773000+00:00) : thats lex luther?

71716577669550080 (2016-10-06T14:53:09.653000+00:00) : so they say eisenberg is "doing it for charity" at the comedy attic
71716577669550080 (2016-10-06T14:52:54.687000+00:00) : so they needed to stage it
71716577669550080 (2016-10-06T14:52:45.845000+00:00) : like what if lex luther was giving a comedy performance

71716577669550080 (2016-10-06T00:27:50.751000+00:00) : http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/5/13175000/samsung-galaxy-note-7-fire-replacement-plane-battery-southwest <@127535721857679362>

71716577669550080 (2016-10-05T20:12:03.539000+00:00) : <@!155893986605793281> found you another spook tune https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lfx5c3yuJH0&list=PLhHcMbVmbwCerhZdxVr4odQY_ZgLXEjET&index=25
71716577669550080 (2016-10-05T19:47:27.584000+00:00) : in case anyone was wondering what the answer was to this very practical problem, it's 1/4 (n-1)
71716577669550080 (2016-10-05T19:28:43.186000+00:00) : There are n crows in a line on a wire. Each crow independently has probability 1/2 to
be facing right and probability 1/2 to facing left. Thus, some pairs of adjacent crows
might be facing each other, some might be facing away from one another, and some
might be facing the same direction (so one is looking at the back of the other). Let Z
be the number of pairs of adjacent crows which are facing each other. Find the expected value of Z.
71716577669550080 (2016-10-05T19:28:40.254000+00:00) : ....
71716577669550080 (2016-10-05T19:28:37.855000+00:00) : ah yes probability is so useful

71716577669550080 (2016-10-05T17:44:33.868000+00:00) : this dota 2 sound track is making me really nostalgic by the way
71716577669550080 (2016-10-05T17:35:07.618000+00:00) : <@!127535721857679362> im interested but i dont have time disucss anything until later tonight or thursday

71716577669550080 (2016-10-05T13:36:21.787000+00:00) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7Ut7Cx_Wrs i remember when we listened to this in the car
71716577669550080 (2016-10-05T13:33:47.700000+00:00) : the only real spooktune is the one i just posted
71716577669550080 (2016-10-05T13:33:40.031000+00:00) : because none of asher's spooktunes are spooky enough

71716577669550080 (2016-10-05T13:30:50.922000+00:00) : it was an obvious reference so why would i comment on it

71716577669550080 (2016-10-05T13:30:15.563000+00:00) : i feel like someone who listens to vgm soundtracks as much as me would definitely get that reference
71716577669550080 (2016-10-05T13:29:24.316000+00:00) : because it also looks like the bastion bird

71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T02:23:12.883000+00:00) : these tetis lyrics dont even make sense
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T02:20:35.921000+00:00) : something thats just a good song in general
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T02:20:26.943000+00:00) : modern games with lyrics use them to say something else beyond the store or not really related to it at all like the bastion stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T02:20:02.959000+00:00) : i think because they are trying to describe the story or whats happening with the lyrics when there's no need to since that stuff is already obvious from the gameplay
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T02:16:03.622000+00:00) : if you opened red and the start up screen was the pokemon rap
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T02:15:51.682000+00:00) : well yeah but theoretically
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T02:15:05.972000+00:00) : it would be awesome still but weird
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T02:14:42.788000+00:00) : can you imagine if the pokemon rap or the pokemon theme song was first introduced in one of the games instead of the anime
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T02:13:16.906000+00:00) : i think these examples demonstrate why video game music typically doesnt have lyrics

71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T02:09:25.896000+00:00) : it's okay
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T02:06:34.042000+00:00) : ive just never listend to pink floyd directly i think

71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T02:06:20.311000+00:00) : ive actually heard a lot of led zepplin and some other bands because of my dads music tastes
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T02:05:41.513000+00:00) : he knew all about rock and roll
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T02:05:29.391000+00:00) : this is not what asian kayboard man played
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T02:05:02.513000+00:00) : is this... rock and roll?
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T02:04:42.718000+00:00) : this is good
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T02:01:57.576000+00:00) : i feel like the bastion composers were inspired by led zepplin
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:34:16.529000+00:00) : ya
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:34:00.514000+00:00) : i cant have a test and math homework due

71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:23:40.993000+00:00) : why does gameworld need so many playlists
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:23:32.422000+00:00) : why exactly
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:23:23.697000+00:00) : i feel like i can devote an entire weekend to do this
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:22:56.862000+00:00) : yeah ive wasted an hour now listening to shit
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:22:03.150000+00:00) : but im pretty sure ronald wont know what it's from
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:21:54.797000+00:00) : its pretty good
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:21:16.267000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:21:11.542000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:21:04.089000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:20:20.506000+00:00) : but i want you to use it too
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:20:00.529000+00:00) : is it ok if i add piano covers and the originals for some of this bastion music
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:18:23.644000+00:00) : here's the song that bastion won like 3 awards for https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cELTdtw6U
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:13:27.705000+00:00) : this is just the master list if we're really motivated we can divide it up into parts later
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:13:05.582000+00:00) : lol thats fine there's supposed to be variety
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:11:59.507000+00:00) : then he'll be all up to date on the good video game music besides fallout
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:11:36.899000+00:00) : we should send this playlist to ronald to listen to while he drives here
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:10:40.309000+00:00) : it's weird but actually pretty good
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:10:00.085000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:05:02.066000+00:00) : fortunately for a lot of these games if they are indie games or just not nintendo games where they put half the budget on music,  their soundtracks are not that long
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:01:49.022000+00:00) : damn if we want this to truly be extensive there will be a lot of "work" to do
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:01:32.609000+00:00) : oh yeh same with shovel knight
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:00:09.929000+00:00) : there's definitely more i can add from there
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T01:00:04.147000+00:00) : oh thanks for reminding me of the bastion soundtrack
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:58:37.588000+00:00) : can we have a separate playlist for the lols
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:58:13.613000+00:00) : this sounds like the one punch man music kind of
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:57:24.884000+00:00) : its probably ok to have multiple versions of the same song if that song's good
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:57:12.768000+00:00) : can i see
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:56:41.886000+00:00) : im just going to add both
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:56:28.591000+00:00) : just it will be a lot different from most of the other stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:56:15.619000+00:00) : not like it's bad
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:56:12.921000+00:00) : i just think the originals especially from the nes era have a really distinct feel
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:55:35.951000+00:00) : i understand
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:54:53.948000+00:00) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFP76k8EoU
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:54:07.300000+00:00) : shit
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:53:34.700000+00:00) : i didnt play other non-nintendo games and im only exposed to their soundtracks through pandora and google music
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:53:01.441000+00:00) : i just grew up with this stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:52:56.844000+00:00) : not like they are bad thouhg
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:52:27.296000+00:00) : and through the entirety of pokemon music
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:52:19.474000+00:00) : oh shit i cant wait until i go through the whole smash bros library
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:51:34.951000+00:00) : probably because it is
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:51:29.799000+00:00) : this sounds like that meme song
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:48:12.167000+00:00) : lol well it's good to make sure we are on the same page if this is the master list of all playlists
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:47:37.785000+00:00) : unless it's a particularly good version of star theme
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:47:24.191000+00:00) : like star theme
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:47:22.267000+00:00) : oh yeah another guideline that is probably a give but dont add shit like soundeffects that is less than 1 minute
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:46:46.853000+00:00) : yeah i used to listen to it a lot back when i used pandora
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:46:19.259000+00:00) : good idea
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:46:16.405000+00:00) : oh shit silent hill is great
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:44:37.523000+00:00) : but they wont always exist which is ok
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:44:30.961000+00:00) : but for older games i think we should try to find non-midi versions if poossible
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:44:09.290000+00:00) : and not just midi
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:44:07.073000+00:00) : the thing i like most about modern games on newer consoles is that their soundtracks are almost always real recordings anyway
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:43:16.738000+00:00) : if there are better renditions out there than the original
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:43:03.866000+00:00) : i mean this holds true for that stuff too
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:42:49.550000+00:00) : like in my opinion if an orchestrated version exists that takes priority
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:42:33.688000+00:00) : if it's classic zelda music for example, we should try to find the orchestrated versions and add that
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:42:18.207000+00:00) : oh ok
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:42:06.304000+00:00) : like what
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:41:36.921000+00:00) : you sohuld go through and listen to everything again so that way we only add the best stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:41:23.993000+00:00) : also dont just add whats on your computer as a playlist already
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:41:03.458000+00:00) : im just adding the best stuff from every vgm soundtrack im listening to that day
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:40:44.048000+00:00) : did you read my guidelines? you should work on the playlist when you have spare time
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:40:32.124000+00:00) : cool
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:39:57.296000+00:00) : ?
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:28:06.171000+00:00) : uhhuh
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:26:32.693000+00:00) : whats your issue boy
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:25:03.468000+00:00) : but with only the best of the best
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:24:57.569000+00:00) : oh yeah my goal for this is to have a library so expansive you can just put it on shuffle and it will be like a radio
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:23:48.132000+00:00) : ?
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:20:12.036000+00:00) : im definitely going to add som assassins creed stuff, some final fantasy, castlevania, age of mythology, kingdom hearts, halo, and starraft stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:19:20.631000+00:00) : just currently for me ive only been listening to nintendo music lately
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:19:06.708000+00:00) : so maybe that was an overestimate
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:18:57.860000+00:00) : i mean half of the songs on my normal playlist aren't nintendo
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:18:36.829000+00:00) : k
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:17:38.784000+00:00) : keenan you need to add yourself as a collaborator with the invite link
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:16:01.316000+00:00) : if you add silvagunner im removing you
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:15:48.279000+00:00) : about what
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:10:46.107000+00:00) : probably 70% nintendo
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:10:39.151000+00:00) : because thats naturally how it will end up
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:10:26.516000+00:00) : also in my opinion it's okay if there is an uneven representation of games/publishers
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:09:44.173000+00:00) : no silvagunner pls
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:09:03.955000+00:00) : because at the end i can go through, duplicate the playlist, and create a personal version
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:08:39.909000+00:00) : i was just about to say that you should also add stuff that i might not necessarily like
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:08:20.637000+00:00) : i know
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:07:58.781000+00:00) : try to add stuff that you think we both would like
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:07:12.145000+00:00) : cool
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:06:52.340000+00:00) : and i'll do it with eventually most games
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:06:44.510000+00:00) : im going to go back through and listen to the whole mk8 soundtrack again and add the best stuff from there
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:06:23.301000+00:00) : like currently it's all dk tropical freeze but thats just because it's what im listening to right now
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:05:27.747000+00:00) : but add songs to this that are things you would share in discord
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:04:57.871000+00:00) : i still need to go through and add all the obvious stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:04:36.962000+00:00) : start adding shit to this
71716577669550080 (2016-09-30T00:04:29.277000+00:00) : keenan https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP-PZmHUrkrH-1SQjNbrlXSZSdkTOvKte&jct=feaxV6QZCuu79lcIavtS1EISwe97mQ
71716577669550080 (2016-09-29T17:58:41.727000+00:00) : keenan tropical freeze soundtrack is really soothing
71716577669550080 (2016-09-29T14:32:34.906000+00:00) : i just liek the artwork they put throughout the book
71716577669550080 (2016-09-29T14:29:42.320000+00:00) : those books are surprisingly useful in multiple ways
71716577669550080 (2016-09-29T14:29:19.640000+00:00) : i think i still have my emerald book
71716577669550080 (2016-09-29T14:23:37.699000+00:00) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsZnsAp_94&index=2&list=PLvNp0Boas723wfsMDJjkwanwllj39NBNu&shuffle=182
71716577669550080 (2016-09-29T13:52:18.149000+00:00) : miecraft
71716577669550080 (2016-09-29T13:42:31.005000+00:00) : i was old enough to remember but i just didnt really play it or have friends that did
71716577669550080 (2016-09-29T13:41:57.835000+00:00) : like i dont really remember when the ps2 wasnt retro
71716577669550080 (2016-09-29T13:41:33.204000+00:00) : you started gaming at an earlier age than me

71716577669550080 (2016-09-28T19:43:33.256000+00:00) : like ronald could re-watch psych because he doesnt actually need to see the screen to know what happening since he's seen it enouhg
71716577669550080 (2016-09-28T19:43:04.473000+00:00) : it gives you a chance to do all kinds of things that you normally dont have time for though thats the point

71716577669550080 (2016-09-28T17:02:41.206000+00:00) : Like I learn new basic things about html/css all the time that I would have learned early on if I didn't teach myself them
71716577669550080 (2016-09-28T17:02:15.777000+00:00) : Ronald you're probably going to miss something trivial and basic that they taught but you didnt bother to learn because you already know the more advanced stuff.

71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T23:58:21.532000+00:00) : whats one site that uses them
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T23:58:17.385000+00:00) : really
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T23:58:06.862000+00:00) : unless they are more like tooltips
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T23:57:57.797000+00:00) : i personally think popups are dated
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T23:56:08.360000+00:00) : even twitter doesnt and they invented it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T23:55:59.655000+00:00) : i dont think there are any sites that even use modal popups anymore
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T23:55:49.641000+00:00) : why not just implement it as routes instead of modal popups
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T23:54:57.293000+00:00) : that seems kind of useless to me

71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T22:19:51.131000+00:00) : this current site isn't bad
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T22:18:51.791000+00:00) : and even if you look at the images your image is just blue
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T22:18:15.293000+00:00) : ronald i mean the colors of the site fonts and layouts not the colors of the images
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T22:17:27.460000+00:00) : in my opinion
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T22:17:24.029000+00:00) : there should be more than two colors
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T22:17:12.985000+00:00) : i also think there's only 2 colors on this site
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T22:15:50.247000+00:00) : i think "Think Team" should go over the banner image
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T22:13:53.714000+00:00) : i hope this is the exact final layout
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T22:12:04.719000+00:00) : only a couple people said yes but im pretty sure everyone knew what it was they just thought it was too dumb a question to reply
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T22:11:10.621000+00:00) : lol my AI instructor just asked a class of mostly computer science students if anyone knew what the game Portal was or if it was too old for you
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T16:18:49.409000+00:00) : they actually have a dedicated bike lane for that sidewalke but its not mark clearly enough and no one respects it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T16:15:19.301000+00:00) : So were you
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T16:13:42.698000+00:00) : Also Keenan walking and biking on the sidewalk are two different things. Especially if you only bike on one side.
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T16:11:45.609000+00:00) : I saw him
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T15:10:40.146000+00:00) : It is known as the greatest track cover up in history
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T15:10:16.925000+00:00) : And framed it as an airplane
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T15:10:04.268000+00:00) : Within seconds of the disaster they immediately tore down the remaining roller coaster tracks so the public wouldn't know how slow the government was to notice the tracks for decades leading up to it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T15:07:19.009000+00:00) : That's how it really happened
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T14:29:22.173000+00:00) : 😦
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T14:29:06.395000+00:00) : ever since ds

71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T14:28:33.120000+00:00) : nintendo knew they had soething good with pokemon so they made the mspecial

71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T13:56:07.917000+00:00) : this just fits the game so amazingly well
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T13:54:19.470000+00:00) : maybe its to handle the hype
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T13:54:12.765000+00:00) : i dont know why i like this song so much

71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T13:51:15.662000+00:00) : like zelda music
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T13:51:02.005000+00:00) : i usually prefer when stuff has real endings instead of fade outs
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T13:38:01.248000+00:00) : thats kind of pointless when you have youtube
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T13:37:24.483000+00:00) : have a lot of hours on it

71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T00:23:13.783000+00:00) : is it a limited number of devices or concurrent streams
71716577669550080 (2016-09-26T00:23:01.878000+00:00) : yeah

71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T20:12:44.596000+00:00) : we can go back to my pro writing
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T19:06:55.222000+00:00) : makes sense
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T19:05:25.916000+00:00) : but i mean if you put both  cards in a computer
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T19:04:16.313000+00:00) : so then you have 2 sd cards with all the games
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T19:04:04.976000+00:00) : but what prevents you make having a second sd card and just copying the stuff exactly
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T19:01:54.942000+00:00) : i see
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T19:00:55.655000+00:00) : i thoguht you couldnt simply just copy games like that
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T18:52:38.220000+00:00) : pretending you have a new wii you are transferring to
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T18:52:29.314000+00:00) : you're just doing a transfer then
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T18:38:11.627000+00:00) : wat
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T18:14:56.043000+00:00) : but at least the website will still be secure
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T18:13:18.168000+00:00) : but what if it's hacked
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T18:04:04.512000+00:00) : actually nvm i have plan
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:58:33.853000+00:00) : yes but if you had acces to that computer you would have access to the files of the site
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:57:16.920000+00:00) : its ftp stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:57:05.407000+00:00) : its not godaddy stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:55:50.601000+00:00) : not like the administrative godaddy account
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:55:44.194000+00:00) : just the files of the site
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:55:29.083000+00:00) : because someone with acces to the username and password can upload/modify anything on the site
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:54:28.134000+00:00) : i can take it out the file and make it more secure by requiring him to type it in
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:54:12.687000+00:00) : so you dont have to type the password each time you want to update the stock
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:54:00.988000+00:00) : well currently i have a more secure password but it's stored in plaintext in a config file
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:52:53.756000+00:00) : or is that the only thing he can remember
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:52:34.020000+00:00) : can it be more secure than that and also something ron would rmember
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:51:13.475000+00:00) : what would be a good password to protect the script uploader
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:50:51.541000+00:00) : keenan
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:34:05.156000+00:00) : probably because its not a jrpg
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:33:56.332000+00:00) : why does eat your potatoes have so many dislikes
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:22:10.669000+00:00) : i think it will be a while until the request goes through
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:21:12.395000+00:00) : lets make this entire radio age of mythology

71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:14:09.891000+00:00) : this warcraft II song has all dislikes
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:07:32.452000+00:00) : which is also random
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:07:27.070000+00:00) : i dont think you have the concept of shuffling
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T17:02:24.892000+00:00) : literally half of their library is final fantasy
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T16:52:29.401000+00:00) : oh i dont even know where that is
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T16:51:55.959000+00:00) : not necessarily since i can bike there
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T16:51:15.667000+00:00) : i can also do fridays after 3
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T16:48:07.678000+00:00) : put the script up, and transfer the site to the main domain

71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T16:43:02.357000+00:00) : i dont really know right now because i think i'll have to modify the script when the site is on the actual server and depending of if you guys added anything new new i should exclude to the latest stock
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T16:41:55.144000+00:00) : yeah sure
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T16:41:51.441000+00:00) : when would be best

71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T16:16:17.025000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T16:15:40.016000+00:00) : 'bundle'
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T16:14:30.603000+00:00) : ?
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T16:14:25.536000+00:00) : ?
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T16:14:19.892000+00:00) : ?
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T16:13:49.813000+00:00) : fuck you
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T16:13:46.744000+00:00) : driving and sitting a car are two different things but we dont have a rule about the differences between driving and riding in one
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T04:23:49.869000+00:00) : i think i finally understand everything
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T01:42:54.011000+00:00) : also are we going to play game tonight
71716577669550080 (2016-09-25T01:42:46.382000+00:00) : keenan did you show the site to anyone else
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T23:44:23.363000+00:00) : but it's a feature under consideration with "low priority" apparently
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T23:44:06.520000+00:00) : tons of websites use it and they all just look bad in ie
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T23:42:57.678000+00:00) : lol ie not supporting css blending is apparently a big deal
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T23:40:35.154000+00:00) : dont know if it works on mobile
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T23:40:30.649000+00:00) : a sketch js demo
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T23:39:29.465000+00:00) : i want this https://codepen.io/soulwire/full/foktm
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T23:09:15.099000+00:00) : here's what it looks like without background blending because microsoft is dumb
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T23:04:37.371000+00:00) : but i realized the search works perfectly fine in edge and IE but there's a new feature i added called "the X" which clears the search field. turns out IE and edge have their own little "X" that clears the search field so i was clicking that instead of my own and it wasnt doing what a programmed. but my own still exists and works
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T23:03:29.027000+00:00) : it still doesnt support my background blending
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T23:03:09.876000+00:00) : ok edge is literally IE but faster
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:59:00.674000+00:00) : you can uninstall all built in windows 10 apps i just forgot how to do it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:58:24.433000+00:00) : ok i cant even figure out how to uninstall edge
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:56:42.744000+00:00) : i think im going to try reinstalling it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:55:45.458000+00:00) : my computer is having trouble opening edge
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:55:26.803000+00:00) : in a couple more years it will be completely dead
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:55:03.211000+00:00) : ever since everyone was forced to get windows 10, i think less people should be using IE anyway since mincrosoft recommends edge now
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:54:13.509000+00:00) : do you guys use IE in your store?
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:54:02.711000+00:00) : but it's still useable i think
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:53:54.468000+00:00) : the search works but it's slower on IE. also some of the styling relating to background images is off
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:52:03.481000+00:00) : but it's not optimal
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:51:58.750000+00:00) : because technically we support it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:51:51.320000+00:00) : how important is IE support
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:51:17.352000+00:00) : a pop up ad
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:51:13.952000+00:00) : what do you want to happen
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:50:06.598000+00:00) : when we exit beta
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:49:36.231000+00:00) : i need to go into the store for that
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:48:01.652000+00:00) : I cant believe IE doesn't support my background blending properties
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:47:36.034000+00:00) : also it works on IE now but still some weird bugs
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:43:40.268000+00:00) : maybe the author should be something else
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:42:01.637000+00:00) : which is why it says my name
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T22:41:55.218000+00:00) : lol discord is reading my authoer meta tag

71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T21:35:43.977000+00:00) : i just remembered that im an idiot and dont know how to deploy angular 2 apps

71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T18:40:26.014000+00:00) : i also think there are some informational sections of the home page that need more content
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T18:40:10.360000+00:00) : alright

71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T18:12:07.350000+00:00) : Mac driving and sitting in a car are two different things. Especially if you only ride backseat

71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T18:03:58.526000+00:00) : im about to put a new version up on gameworlds domain
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T17:49:25.398000+00:00) : I don't even think i fully understand this fresh new meme
71716577669550080 (2016-09-24T17:11:08.255000+00:00) : Sitting Mac and different in a ride are driving especially backseat. Two if you only car things.

71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:17:57.709000+00:00) : but i also have the added bonus of experiencing a large part of the other factor by simply being a passanger in the car
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:15:38.964000+00:00) : i have to worry about cars passing me just as much as cars have to worry about it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:15:14.706000+00:00) : ronald, if you dont bike, you wont understand why you simply cant go on the sidewalk. if i dont drive, i can still understand what its like being a car alongside the road with a bike because i am one of the two factors there
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:13:19.629000+00:00) : it only goes one way
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:13:15.261000+00:00) : you cant make the counter assumption
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:12:30.859000+00:00) : you dont have to actually drive to know what it's like driving alongside bikes
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:12:06.010000+00:00) : car has more than one person in it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:12:00.386000+00:00) : a bike is a one person vehicle you have to be on it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:11:24.018000+00:00) : yes i can
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:10:53.229000+00:00) : but dont need to actually be driving the car to understand what it's like driving a car with bikers on the road
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:09:55.654000+00:00) : and will accept the fact they have to go on roads
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:09:41.813000+00:00) : gernally people other than you will agree that there's no better place to go if you're a biker
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:09:01.066000+00:00) : if you've ever ridden a bike you would understand
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:08:53.632000+00:00) : its not
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:08:42.428000+00:00) : most bikers will agree riding on the sidewalk is a lot more dangerous than riding on the road
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:08:02.707000+00:00) : or there's a curb
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:07:59.796000+00:00) : actually you cant if you have a road bike
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:07:50.208000+00:00) : and generally people trying to walk think your an asshole if you go on the sidewalk when theres not a lot of room
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:07:24.149000+00:00) : and they walk in groups
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:07:19.077000+00:00) : also people walk on the sidewalk arent always single file
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:07:09.691000+00:00) : its not all about the speed of the collision ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:06:01.526000+00:00) : if you are on the road you endanger just yourself
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:05:50.836000+00:00) : if you ride on the sidewalk you are endangering both yourself and the pedestrians
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:05:18.001000+00:00) : not on campus
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:03:44.649000+00:00) : because people walk on the side walk
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:03:25.946000+00:00) : sidewalks are not designed for bikes either
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T20:00:36.739000+00:00) : any time
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:54:08.703000+00:00) : its ok to run stop signs if no cars are there though
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:54:00.021000+00:00) : i dont agree with bikers running red lights
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:53:18.540000+00:00) : the problem isnt bikers its the lack of bike lanes
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:53:10.434000+00:00) : but theres nothing else they can do
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:50:26.089000+00:00) : its also not legal to run it indirectly
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:50:11.604000+00:00) : because jaywalking is literally just running a redlight
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:49:55.975000+00:00) : why not just run the red light
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:49:52.571000+00:00) : why would they even have to go to the sidewalk
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:49:39.973000+00:00) : how is that different from jaywalking pedestrians
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:48:33.848000+00:00) : put on document
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:48:28.173000+00:00) : also ask what final changes
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:48:13.601000+00:00) : like i told you
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:48:09.610000+00:00) : the server
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:47:38.930000+00:00) : i have no idea what you're saying
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:46:10.571000+00:00) : i dont understand how they are getting past a red light if it's a 4 wy intersection
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:42:51.554000+00:00) : it still has to be green to cross the side walk
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:42:43.989000+00:00) : how would you even do that
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:41:11.610000+00:00) : also who the fuck puts spaces in folder names omg
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:38:28.238000+00:00) : also people who think roads are meant for cars are assholes
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:21:08.037000+00:00) : then where do bikes go
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:18:38.289000+00:00) : i would look like an asshole if i tried to pass a car going really slow on my bike
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:18:21.091000+00:00) : im pretty sure theres some double standards here
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:16:25.586000+00:00) : they're annoying because they slow down traffic but if they are going faster than traffic why do cars still need to pass
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:15:32.361000+00:00) : i wonder if i can make them get a ticket by forcing them to go 10 mph over if they want to pass
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T19:14:34.174000+00:00) : i dont understand why cars still feel the need to pass me on my bike when im going 5-7 miles over the speed limit already
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T14:32:47.939000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T14:31:28.038000+00:00) : its his own damn fault he was sleeping
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T14:30:00.780000+00:00) : you're going to be way ahead of me, im only at the third save point
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T14:28:14.158000+00:00) : after i play through this i might go back and play saga while i wait for dream team to become cheap
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T14:27:26.140000+00:00) : and suck everything
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T14:27:00.113000+00:00) : its ok you can still play as bowser
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T14:26:47.679000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T14:26:03.544000+00:00) : i know they have but i want it in just normal mario games
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T14:25:28.095000+00:00) : i wish they gave mario voice acting like he has in every mario game
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T14:19:22.018000+00:00) : and dialogue
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T14:19:18.653000+00:00) : the characters are so good in that game

71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T01:22:23.560000+00:00) : 💦
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T01:05:54.925000+00:00) : why not
71716577669550080 (2016-09-23T01:05:34.928000+00:00) : what
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T15:11:39.418000+00:00) : No ideally i would tap into a  Google/Amazon/wikipedia API to calculate that since they already have it worked out
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T14:54:07.136000+00:00) : I can probably make it subtract just a little bit so stuff is ranked better without sending it below the threshold
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T14:51:03.445000+00:00) : so i just chose what i thought to be best for most titles
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T14:50:32.295000+00:00) : there's no way to handle that on a case by case basis because obviously how i should handle it varies on the game
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T14:49:58.758000+00:00) : if you search "mario" you likely want any game with mario in it, and a lot of mario games can have very long titles that are still mario games but all those matching terms would cause the relevance score to go below the threshold
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T14:48:30.012000+00:00) : theres a reason for that
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T14:47:00.358000+00:00) : additional non matching terms wont subtract from it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T14:46:46.728000+00:00) : because my relevance score is all additive
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T14:43:56.075000+00:00) : i know why thats happening

71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T14:41:02.240000+00:00) : or i would have to go through every game title and determine that

71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T01:12:18.429000+00:00) : he thinks dkc is not that challenging
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T01:11:41.796000+00:00) : np

71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T01:10:29.129000+00:00) : keenan is way better at platformers than the average person
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T01:07:36.886000+00:00) : instead of the obscure one "snes"
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T01:07:27.815000+00:00) : thank you for using the proper abbreviation
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T01:06:15.065000+00:00) : i wont but you can listen to his theme at least
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T01:04:58.906000+00:00) : one of the reasons people liked this game so much
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T01:04:47.479000+00:00) : fawful is such an amazing villan
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T01:04:14.179000+00:00) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EH6U242mC0&list=PL0F1CC7E40779F15F&index=10
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T01:03:15.133000+00:00) : and it wasnt the duck song
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T01:03:06.469000+00:00) : i forgot what it was
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T01:03:00.277000+00:00) : ronald once sent me a song that he liked so much he listened to it on repeat for like 3 days
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:56:22.126000+00:00) : no i really like philip glass i just  dont know if it's ideal for overwatch
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:55:59.906000+00:00) : but some times you have to be soothed for overwatch as well
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:55:50.591000+00:00) : i dont know why thats in there
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:55:32.170000+00:00) : yah this is my overwatch playlist
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:54:44.241000+00:00) : just click the link
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:54:03.780000+00:00) : this version is a remix but the original is also very good
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:53:42.587000+00:00) : here's my favorite spooky video game song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAuqowo5vA4&list=PLP-PZmHUrkrHW0r3Lq0pFEH18RJoBVb6p&index=4
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:53:30.011000+00:00) : oh by the way keenan
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:46:47.512000+00:00) : what are you talking about
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:45:56.484000+00:00) : after i finish the website i have another three websites to make
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:45:28.449000+00:00) : except my pace will be really slow since i have no time
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:45:20.661000+00:00) : you should start it, we can play through at same pace
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:45:07.420000+00:00) : it's a brilliant game
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:44:39.544000+00:00) : like the good old days when we used to play fallout together
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:44:16.953000+00:00) : ok but this way we can play it together
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:43:52.280000+00:00) : then i lost it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:43:43.684000+00:00) : did i get it back
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:43:29.705000+00:00) : did i lend it to you
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:42:46.040000+00:00) : but i opened the title screen and remembered how good the music was
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:42:36.128000+00:00) : it just came today and i really want to play it again but im refraining myself
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:42:24.883000+00:00) : so a couple days ago i had a really nice dream about playing bowsers inside story but i lost the game like 4 years ago and couldnt play it, so i bought it on ebay 5 minutes after i woke up
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:40:06.161000+00:00) : so happy
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:39:51.171000+00:00) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDMPKHRze30&index=48&list=PL2XjmdkuVL-04v0wkzgB5vxpyI1Rcv_Dw&shuffle=2502
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:38:38.635000+00:00) : where every song is good
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:38:34.539000+00:00) : this reminds me of that
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:38:28.187000+00:00) : i sometimes put the smash 4 playlist of like 300 songs on shuffle and repeat
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:37:34.413000+00:00) : then i guess i dont like the genre
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:37:11.877000+00:00) : it is very repeatitive
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:37:07.491000+00:00) : not kind of
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:36:37.980000+00:00) : id consider it kind of repeatitive
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:34:02.562000+00:00) : i really like mount wario https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1fZFQrxgdc&index=15&list=PL2XjmdkuVL-04v0wkzgB5vxpyI1Rcv_Dw
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:27:11.748000+00:00) : look at that bitch
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:27:01.331000+00:00) : http://localhost:8888/gameworld/gw-main/#/catalog;type=allgames;stores=%7B%22east%22%3Atrue%2C%22west%22%3Atrue%2C%22bedford%22%3Atrue%7D;items=both;catid=all;query=;page=1
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:26:16.232000+00:00) : ok keenan im trying out this url thing btw and i dont know if like it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:24:51.809000+00:00) : oh thats another one i still need to watch
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:23:25.910000+00:00) : i still dont think he ever read that conversation
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:22:56.527000+00:00) : while at a meeting
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:22:50.896000+00:00) : ever since he kept discord open while you guys where talking about your new found brotherhood
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:22:23.243000+00:00) : which is honestly probably what scared ronald away
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:22:08.345000+00:00) : i cant even check it on my phone during school or something because half of the time it's all porn
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:21:24.181000+00:00) : like he'll probably never read this message
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:21:17.201000+00:00) : he only reads stuff in the moment
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:20:55.404000+00:00) : i understand why ronald probably never reads chat history
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:19:26.333000+00:00) : i still havent watched the shit keenan sent monday morning
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:19:17.521000+00:00) : guys how am i supposed to have time for all these links
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:13:42.622000+00:00) : no i have to go back and actually listen ot them
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:13:28.497000+00:00) : because i never actually opened the videos
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:13:18.298000+00:00) : i just realized that earlier you were linking to the parody gilvasunner and not the real one
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:10:25.342000+00:00) : lol that clip is more interesting than the real version
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:07:20.965000+00:00) : but no literally all it is are those 30 second clips
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:07:07.051000+00:00) : which i would be fine with if there was like a full soundtrack you could listen to
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:06:50.789000+00:00) : the rest is like 30 sec sound bites that are meant for ambient noise or map intro
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:06:28.218000+00:00) : literally the only real song overwatch has is the theme which is also the potg music
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:05:21.945000+00:00) : this reminds me how much i find overwatch lazy on the music side. mario kart has unique songs for each track and they have 32 courses. overwatch barely has 30 second intro clips for each of their 13 courses
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:02:57.041000+00:00) : i will too
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:02:39.015000+00:00) : but ive noticed while playing
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:02:30.917000+00:00) : ive never listened to it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-22T00:00:23.539000+00:00) : _except the one true ronald_
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T23:59:34.041000+00:00) : bick dick lanm is the actual nickname of a dota player
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T23:58:01.601000+00:00) : "Nicknames are visiable to everyone on the server. Do not change them unless you are enforcing a naming system or removing bad nickname" finally we are using the nickname system for it's intended purpose
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T23:55:12.372000+00:00) : or the ronald ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T23:55:08.918000+00:00) : better than the mac ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T23:54:31.897000+00:00) : at least we still have big dick daddy ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T23:53:10.138000+00:00) : because we're annoying ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T23:52:59.916000+00:00) : the just went offline ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T23:52:00.577000+00:00) : the responds to your messages ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T23:51:50.700000+00:00) : the not volatile ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T23:51:44.418000+00:00) : i miss the old ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T23:50:32.880000+00:00) : goddamnit i guess he's the just went offline ronald now
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T23:49:36.609000+00:00) : i just learned something truly amazing
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T23:49:19.911000+00:00) : ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T20:31:53.244000+00:00) : no the server hasnt been up for a while
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T20:31:44.418000+00:00) : oh ok did you take your card off
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T20:30:51.655000+00:00) : ?
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T20:28:25.729000+00:00) : except for the part where you can look at my sidebar icon
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T20:27:51.307000+00:00) : and asher sees: "Mac, Mac and Mac are typing..."
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T20:21:20.932000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T20:21:13.725000+00:00) : for posterity
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T19:57:33.630000+00:00) : you should just make a playlist for us
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T18:27:29.653000+00:00) : although to be honest a subscription to that type of channel isnt very useful
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T18:24:57.154000+00:00) : Ever since music theory in highschool where Keenan and I did a video game music project
71716577669550080 (2016-09-21T18:24:38.235000+00:00) : I've been subscribed to that channel for a long time

71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T15:09:05.965000+00:00) : there i did it for you
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:53:01.972000+00:00) : you should be able to add a new role of the color you want and apply it to yourself to get that color
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:34:53.251000+00:00) : but that shouldn't prevent you from changing my name
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:34:43.384000+00:00) : maybe it wont work because im the owner and have all permissions regardless of roles
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:34:29.035000+00:00) : idk i gave everyone full permissions
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:33:12.928000+00:00) : you should have permissions
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:31:10.174000+00:00) : hopefully this names embarass ronald when he keeps discord on for group work and interviews
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:21:02.833000+00:00) : thank you for representing the best of online gaming
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:20:18.459000+00:00) : ew
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:19:38.878000+00:00) : boy you aren't even a heal slut

71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:16:31.104000+00:00) : 2. add your artworkd
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:16:24.071000+00:00) : 1. add category filter
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:16:16.475000+00:00) : there are ttwo things left to do on the site
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:12:15.066000+00:00) : in that case there aren't any features either
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:10:52.739000+00:00) : there are no bugs keenan
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:10:47.769000+00:00) : "bug checking"
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:10:23.944000+00:00) : otherwise im going to go directly to a development area on this new space
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:10:09.814000+00:00) : i mean if he has hesitations i'll have a development preview of the site up tonight hopefully on my own space if he wants to see
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:09:11.323000+00:00) : i can send you another screenshot if you want
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:08:26.553000+00:00) : i dont think i'll have time to host something he can look at before tonight
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:08:01.834000+00:00) : like even if he hates it and wants a completely different one than he'll still need a hosting plan
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:07:48.325000+00:00) : this is something he would want to do regardless of if he uses my site or not
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:06:43.223000+00:00) : that you can preview
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:06:40.635000+00:00) : part of the hosting plan is to allow me to run a development site
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:06:26.499000+00:00) : so basically he can just pay 143 dollars for 3 years of hosting and after that it doubles in price i think
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:05:28.044000+00:00) : such as the stock of duck dynasty
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:05:16.914000+00:00) : and all your sensitive publically available information lost
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:05:05.459000+00:00) : unless you are really worried about getting hacked
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:04:28.915000+00:00) : dont need that shit
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:04:26.751000+00:00) : like site backup and restore, sitelock malware scanning, and an SSL certificate
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:04:07.828000+00:00) : also he might be tempted but they try to sell you tons of additional shit
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:03:31.682000+00:00) : unless you want more than one website for some reason
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:03:24.012000+00:00) : yes
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:03:22.223000+00:00) : but after that it will be 8/month
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:03:11.363000+00:00) : actually you get pay 4/month if you buy a 36 month term
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:01:41.851000+00:00) : they always do this sale thing where it's on sale for like a month and then when you renew it basically doubles in price
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:01:03.888000+00:00) : personally i dont like godaddy that much but im familiar with it and dont know what else to use at the moment
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:00:30.031000+00:00) : depends if he wants unlimited or 1 website
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:00:12.843000+00:00) : it really doesnt matter
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T14:00:03.074000+00:00) : https://www.godaddy.com/hosting/web-hosting
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T13:59:58.401000+00:00) : id get economy or deluxe
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T13:58:19.368000+00:00) : ok hold on
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T13:58:17.017000+00:00) : i think godaddy makes things pretty noob friendly stuff should be self explanatory, my only requirement is linux and cpanel
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T13:57:21.392000+00:00) : yes but it's a purchase
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T13:57:17.413000+00:00) : the scale and size capacity is up to him, depending on how much traffic he gets
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T13:56:57.586000+00:00) : get one that is on linux and has cpanel
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T13:56:47.415000+00:00) : just log on to goddaddy, and look at hostings options
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T13:56:20.400000+00:00) : i can put it on one of my server spaces tonight if i have time
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T13:55:54.999000+00:00) : also tell your boss to make a hosting account, i basically have a complete site
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T13:55:20.569000+00:00) : i'll watch these when im done with my assignment

71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T13:41:34.353000+00:00) : the lyrics are actually well written
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T13:39:59.263000+00:00) : my favorite part of this is that it's official

71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:35:13.796000+00:00) : Haven't decided what I'll do yet
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:32:28.848000+00:00) : I'd probably do some internship this summer
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:31:37.781000+00:00) : Yeah it's on my immediate todo list
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:29:11.990000+00:00) : Because i need to make one which i don't have time to do right now
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:28:48.789000+00:00) : I was waiting until i knew the deadline
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:27:45.553000+00:00) : I still haven't put a resume on there yet
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:27:05.240000+00:00) : I'd also be willing to just buy a ticket but I'd have to know if I'm registered first
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:26:45.436000+00:00) : I doubt many people will be flying there though
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:26:17.031000+00:00) : It means i can only fly if the flights aren't full but i won't know that until closer to the date
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:25:50.471000+00:00) : You just make sure it's not full and i can get on it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:25:35.582000+00:00) : Actually you don't really book until the day of
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:25:17.231000+00:00) : I can't book flights if im flying standby until like the week before
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:24:57.230000+00:00) : But it also says they say when due date is getting close
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:23:54.698000+00:00) : But I probably will
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:23:09.485000+00:00) : Idk they haven't sent any further information about application due dates
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:20:29.248000+00:00) : or for delegating tasks you dont want on your own computer
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:20:14.885000+00:00) : but something like gcp or aws would also be nice for running scripts 24/7
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:19:50.429000+00:00) : neither do i
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:18:03.698000+00:00) : in google cloud you get a lot of discounts for long term usage
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:17:00.533000+00:00) : i think the google cloud minecraft server wasn't usage based
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:16:46.817000+00:00) : its only like that in the smaller plans
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:16:39.839000+00:00) : apache is difficult for modern frameworks
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:16:16.036000+00:00) : not just apache
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:16:12.769000+00:00) : its more flexible and i can run node servers
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:15:59.517000+00:00) : if i do i'd rather it be through something like google cloud platform or aws
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:14:45.563000+00:00) : i'll probably host a developmental version of this gameworld site there though in a couple days
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:14:26.388000+00:00) : i think they terminate all process like apache over the summer
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:14:13.943000+00:00) : i still have the server space the server is just not running at the moment
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:13:37.616000+00:00) : also i cant use this power mode plugin for atom on my laptop because it lags too much 😦
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:12:42.784000+00:00) : also half of my stuff is over ssh anyway so it's not like i need to transfer files frequently
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:12:26.011000+00:00) : so i can keep them consistent
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:12:19.378000+00:00) : i got a plugin for atom that syncs all settings and plugins
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:12:09.871000+00:00) : no but im going to start
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:11:41.324000+00:00) : and i dont feel like moving them
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:11:36.295000+00:00) : but all the files are here
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:11:24.686000+00:00) : because i should be coding on my desktop anyway
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:10:49.722000+00:00) : 8gb
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:10:25.432000+00:00) : i also have 2 excel sheets open and a sass compiler and typescript compiler
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:09:51.420000+00:00) : and atom is running with like 12 tabes
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:09:37.723000+00:00) : i have four chrome windows open
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:09:08.461000+00:00) : 83% memory usage and average of 40% cpu
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:08:39.924000+00:00) : like it lags when i type in discord
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:08:30.826000+00:00) : my laptop is under really heavy load right now and it never takes more than 3 seconds
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:06:35.166000+00:00) : also part of the simplicity of this site is it doesnt need a server side
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:06:21.990000+00:00) : anything beyond string matching is overkill
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:04:13.660000+00:00) : ahh great idea
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:03:15.920000+00:00) : and ones with both call of duty and playstation in them will be ranked the highest
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:02:56.504000+00:00) : so all the listings with call of duty in them will be ranked higher than the ones with playstation in them
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:02:35.637000+00:00) : but the category search has a lower weight
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:02:19.409000+00:00) : you can search for "call of duty playstation" and get games for the playstation listed first
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:01:41.048000+00:00) : so i just search through titles and the console it's for
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:01:22.972000+00:00) : because the gameworld people dont have descriptions on their stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:01:14.276000+00:00) : the limiting factor of this search is really the fact that i can only search through game titles
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:00:29.325000+00:00) : like "the legend of zelda a link to the past" is only 4 terms
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T06:00:07.454000+00:00) : but it's rare for a query to be that long
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:59:59.298000+00:00) : yeah i dont consider it at all
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:59:45.607000+00:00) : keenan came to me originally and said can you make a site that is basically just a search bar
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:59:23.474000+00:00) : probably but considering the searching thing is literally the only function of this site
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:59:06.285000+00:00) : it removes the last one they typed
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:58:15.931000+00:00) : yea
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:57:57.284000+00:00) : speed also reduces drastically the more terms they enter so i cap it at 6
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:57:34.355000+00:00) : it's a slightly stricter cuttoff if they enter fewer terms
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:57:09.504000+00:00) : the exact cutoff depends on how many terms they entered
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:56:58.543000+00:00) : yeah i normalize the score between 0 and 1 and generally scores less than 20-50% relevance get cut off
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:56:11.399000+00:00) : yes
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:56:03.815000+00:00) : damerau-levenshtein basically measures the distance between two strings in terms of insertions, deletions, substituions, and transpositions
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:55:01.637000+00:00) : it breaks down by words, excludes some punctuation, excludes words i deem irrelevent like 'the' and words <= 2 letters, then applies adamerau-levenshtein distance function on them with each word in list of items and assigns a relevance score based on the value of that function
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:52:32.160000+00:00) : lol wtf why does it have a ps4 and xbox one game
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:51:45.249000+00:00) : whatever that is
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:51:38.028000+00:00) : plus like three different duck dynasty games
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:51:07.022000+00:00) : i love how i can search " asdfaksdf fuck asdf" and get donald duck for the gameboy color and some game called  buck bumble for the nintendo 64
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:49:09.134000+00:00) : https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-block-formatting-contexts-in-css/
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:49:07.677000+00:00) : it applies a block formatting context
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:48:08.156000+00:00) : that determine how a div holds content
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:47:57.147000+00:00) : because it applies some other properties besides that
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:46:39.006000+00:00) : the outer container is screwed because you didnt put overflow:hidden on it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:46:22.873000+00:00) : it's simpler than it looks
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:46:15.782000+00:00) : i would spend some time looking into it if you're having trouble positioning stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:45:59.782000+00:00) : here's what i discovered today thats really cool https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:44:51.530000+00:00) : but you're probably not doing something right so im telling you set widths manually
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:44:37.013000+00:00) : because it should force the div to take up remaining space
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:44:00.178000+00:00) : and making them both float left
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:43:55.580000+00:00) : thats literally all bootstrap is doing
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:43:40.026000+00:00) : make the image container width:66% and the desc container width 33%
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:43:14.305000+00:00) : fine then just set widths
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:40:58.997000+00:00) : actually make just the image float left, and give the description overfflow:hidden
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:39:34.763000+00:00) : you got to div them and float left
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:38:59.194000+00:00) : in bootstrap cols are divs
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:38:51.073000+00:00) : make them divs
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:38:27.091000+00:00) : i know
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:37:27.681000+00:00) : i dont think that matters if you are using float on both things
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:36:40.812000+00:00) : because divs are display blcok by devault
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:36:29.861000+00:00) : idk divs
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:35:20.498000+00:00) : idk why you are using spans but they might have to be set to display:block or inline-block
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:34:49.010000+00:00) : and give the parent container overflow:hidden
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:34:37.972000+00:00) : make them both float left
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:33:53.464000+00:00) : oh nvm i know what you mean
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:33:41.345000+00:00) : tags
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:33:39.836000+00:00) : just use p tages
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:33:35.521000+00:00) : i need to see the elements
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T05:31:42.036000+00:00) : yeah hes good
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T04:24:29.383000+00:00) : look at the fourth one
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T04:24:25.128000+00:00) : http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T04:24:21.974000+00:00) : oh shit i found discord's loading icon
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T04:21:54.165000+00:00) : its totally a 90s website gif
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T04:19:39.731000+00:00) : especially looping shit
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T04:19:25.772000+00:00) : gifs on webpages violate all my principles
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T04:17:46.078000+00:00) : ive never squashed so many bugs so fast in my life
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:34:35.943000+00:00) : yes
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:34:16.695000+00:00) : but really any of them would look good
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:34:10.883000+00:00) : the question mark or the r
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:33:04.892000+00:00) : unknown looks kind of like the search symvbol
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:32:24.915000+00:00) : can you draw unknown
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:31:18.613000+00:00) : we found you a riki
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:30:44.757000+00:00) : like dota
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:30:40.987000+00:00) : pick some game that they would never buy at gameworld
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:30:23.187000+00:00) : you should come up with something specific to this site soonish though
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:30:01.010000+00:00) : im using soul boy as a placeholder for now
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:29:48.844000+00:00) : there's so much room for creativity here
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:28:32.655000+00:00) : i dont think ron will appreciate it though
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:28:12.705000+00:00) : yay
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:27:29.283000+00:00) : it makes me sad that im not good enough to have my own
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:27:21.061000+00:00) : i really like discords loading icon

71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:25:22.285000+00:00) : i'd actually like to think my search algorithm is pretty lenient
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:24:49.327000+00:00) : p.s. it could be out of stock
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:24:11.472000+00:00) : or you know they could not have it in stock
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:22:50.912000+00:00) : its not just not found file, it's not found search item
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:22:42.363000+00:00) : yeah totally makes sense
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:21:44.950000+00:00) : i kind of want something that relates to not found that i can show when they search for something and dont find it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T03:20:02.061000+00:00) : can you put it on the computer

71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T02:15:11.215000+00:00) : apparently the ceo of that company is a jackass
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T02:11:03.946000+00:00) : its made by the same people who made smite and apparently thats going to shit
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T02:10:54.197000+00:00) : and it looked absolutely terrible
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T02:10:45.989000+00:00) : i watched a review for the beta version of this game when i was still considering buying overwatch

71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T02:10:24.798000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T02:04:46.062000+00:00) : he shouldve done that
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T02:04:36.634000+00:00) : thats true but he didnt mention the good indie games that already came out this year
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T02:03:22.237000+00:00) : although he said all games were shit this year but didnt mention stardew valley or overwatch at all
71716577669550080 (2016-09-19T02:03:03.497000+00:00) : this guy does a great job at highlighting indie games

71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T23:33:43.003000+00:00) : i need to host it first and before i do that i want to make sure the bulk of the editing is done
71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T23:33:15.005000+00:00) : NO
71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T23:32:52.919000+00:00) : fortunately the search should only take like 3-4 seconds max if they put in something really complicated
71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T23:32:22.418000+00:00) : only to dissappoint you in the end
71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T23:32:13.901000+00:00) : ive tried so hard to get it work
71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T23:32:05.400000+00:00) : keenan for now there isnt going to be a loading icon while it's searching the catalog
71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T23:22:43.862000+00:00) : 😦 i tried to edit someone else's stack overflow answer because they spelled "length" wrong but then it said avoid trivial edits
71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T23:05:02.732000+00:00) : WOO
71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T23:02:54.601000+00:00) : I DID FILTERS
71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T20:27:07.150000+00:00) : it doesnt suck it's just slightly outdated
71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T20:20:53.034000+00:00) : i feel like there's so many nuances of css that even though i've known it for 4 or 5 years i can always discover something new
71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T20:19:51.991000+00:00) : just discovered an entire featureset of css thats extremely useful but have never heard of before

71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T20:05:20.603000+00:00) : i think you should try tuning it off
71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T19:58:59.864000+00:00) : so good that in fact i dont even need to try to aim
71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T19:58:37.732000+00:00) : but personally i cant even tell the diference since im so good at aiming
71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T19:57:39.554000+00:00) : less is more which is why i removed my crosshair
71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T19:56:02.719000+00:00) : i dont even need a crosshair and i could still aim
71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T19:55:42.395000+00:00) : aiming doesnt take any skill and therefor crosshair style doesnt matter at all
71716577669550080 (2016-09-18T19:50:22.026000+00:00) : thats not true you first played mcress 25 times on my account

71716577669550080 (2016-09-17T19:18:39.385000+00:00) : its completely different, angular2 handles most asynchronous things with reactive js data structures
71716577669550080 (2016-09-17T19:17:30.841000+00:00) : asynchronously update a loading a icon while the search filter is working

71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T02:43:53.383000+00:00) : i mean it could be but it could just as easily be wrong
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T02:42:50.270000+00:00) : im just saying i dont think any of us are really in a position to vouch for the validity of this list so you just have to be skeptical about it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T02:41:35.137000+00:00) : how are you supposed to know who uses websites for what
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T02:41:20.360000+00:00) : i think you're just making shit up
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T02:40:06.248000+00:00) : anyway the only thing i know for sure is google and facebook are number 1 and 2, i dont trust anything else on this list
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T02:39:37.852000+00:00) : ebay is not designed nearly as much to browse as amazon is
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T02:38:40.683000+00:00) : amazon has way better browsing tools than ebay
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T02:37:14.400000+00:00) : i understand a lot of people use them but is it really more than twitter or instagram or netflix
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T02:36:50.607000+00:00) : i just dont trust it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T02:35:53.023000+00:00) : twitter/instagram/netflix are definitely visited much more i'd think
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T02:35:20.108000+00:00) : how is yahoo number 4  and craigslist number 6
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T02:34:57.615000+00:00) : i dont believe that list
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T01:41:40.499000+00:00) : tell me when any of you guys wsant to play stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T01:32:40.986000+00:00) : I don't think it was called that
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T01:26:39.342000+00:00) : Who sang that song
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T00:26:44.336000+00:00) : did you write your novel too
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T00:26:32.852000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T00:26:11.777000+00:00) : what
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T00:25:58.404000+00:00) : but you will
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T00:25:01.319000+00:00) : are you going to play games tonight?
71716577669550080 (2016-09-11T00:16:57.271000+00:00) : are any of you guys going to play agems tongiht/?
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:50:38.372000+00:00) : delete key is far away, triple clicking is three clicks and sometimes you click too fast and it's actually a quad click
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:45:33.702000+00:00) : or theres no fast way to delete an entire line
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:45:16.223000+00:00) : and still there's no key that inserts a new line directly below or above
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:44:49.518000+00:00) : also the home button is far away and on most laptop keyboards you have to press a modifier key for it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:43:41.552000+00:00) : the home button just goes to the top of the page
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:43:11.323000+00:00) : like normally if your cursor isin the middle of a line and you wanted to start a new line, you have to move it over to the end of the line and press enter. but in vim you can just type o and it will insert a new line below and start at the front of that line no matter where your cursor is
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:41:51.850000+00:00) : i need this type of shit no matter what im editing
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:41:39.675000+00:00) : or below it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:41:30.409000+00:00) : or above it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:41:28.176000+00:00) : or one button to append new text to the front of the line
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:41:02.812000+00:00) : imagine if you were typing something, made a mistake, and had to arrow key back to the middle of the line. now imagine there was just one button you could press to move your cursor back to the end of the line to append new text to it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:38:36.493000+00:00) : i can barely even type in google docs or type an email because im so used to using vim shit
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:37:23.274000+00:00) : you just dont know what you're missing
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:31:23.099000+00:00) : you also have to account for the time it takes to move your hand away from the keyboard to the mouse and back again
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:29:04.271000+00:00) : it's not because you have to use a mouse to click anddrag over the text you want
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:11:32.430000+00:00) : or maybe you wanted to surround everything inside [ ] with parenthesis so you would type si[(
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:09:50.091000+00:00) : roonald i bet you cant type sw" to surround a word in "
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:04:59.731000+00:00) : i havent, half of my work is over ssh so i use vim for that. I also use vim keybinds in every text editor/IDE
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:04:19.761000+00:00) : i think their dev team is aware that chromium and node means a large sacrifice in performance but it allows it to be completely hackable which is their main advertised feature
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:03:25.041000+00:00) : it's basically a web browser
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:03:20.566000+00:00) : node and chromium
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:02:55.048000+00:00) : yah
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:02:53.803000+00:00) : but on my desktop i can use atom since it loads instantly either way
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:02:37.087000+00:00) : since it's written in node and javscript instead of c
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:02:24.119000+00:00) : the reason i stopped using atom on my laptop is because it loaded up a lot slower than sublime
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:01:52.342000+00:00) : you'll have to do it on your desktop if you dont want lag
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:01:16.087000+00:00) : it's fun
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:01:14.737000+00:00) : you have to experience it yourself
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:00:44.848000+00:00) : but i get a smooth 60 fps on desktop
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:00:37.433000+00:00) : i had to turn it off on my laptop
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T23:00:31.961000+00:00) : no i think it's the particle effects
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T21:53:51.006000+00:00) : wtf if i want to get decent text editor fps i have to use my desktop
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T20:57:28.728000+00:00) : literally torchlight

71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T17:10:30.747000+00:00) : ya

71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T17:10:10.069000+00:00) : ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-09-10T00:35:15.621000+00:00) : are we going to play anything tongiht
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T20:51:01.184000+00:00) : You should come over after I take a nap and go shopping
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T20:31:45.054000+00:00) : Cam you play stuff in like an hour?
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T19:06:14.088000+00:00) : the other maps arent balanced for that since they arent symmetric
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T19:06:04.205000+00:00) : that sounds interesting although the only problem is you would have to switch to an actual king of the hill map
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T19:05:37.600000+00:00) : like best of one king of the hill for tiebreaker?
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T18:58:31.183000+00:00) : as opposed to overwatch where you have no idea why you gain or lose what pints you did
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T18:58:01.647000+00:00) : you gain points when you win, you lose points when you lose, there are separate numbers for solo and party
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T18:57:15.725000+00:00) : not because the scoring system is flawed
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T18:57:05.897000+00:00) : if you complain about it's because you think you are ranked where you dont belong
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T18:56:19.735000+00:00) : no one complains about dota's elo system
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T18:56:04.858000+00:00) : i dont understand why all games with a ranked system use some stupid and complicated system when they could just do what dota does
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T18:55:17.593000+00:00) : they could have balanced it better instead of putting draws
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T18:55:06.827000+00:00) : because the previous thing was sudden death and i heard that was basically a coin flip depending on if you got attack or defense
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T18:50:50.203000+00:00) : Overwatch ranked is rigged as fuck
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T18:49:43.703000+00:00) : I warned you
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T14:15:37.407000+00:00) : It may be a good opportunity any way to finish the website because i was going to work on that this weekend. I dont think I have much actual homework this time
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T14:11:12.898000+00:00) : Then both you and her can sit in my room while i do homework
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T14:10:08.970000+00:00) : You can come sit in.my room.and watch hulu while i do homework
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T14:01:39.753000+00:00) : You can come play overwatch with me tonight at my apartment

71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T02:19:26.124000+00:00) : lol "Discord will not reconnect automatically to a voice channel on startup if it has been off for more than five minutes. No more surprise moaning."
71716577669550080 (2016-09-09T00:47:55.887000+00:00) : 😦
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T21:29:11.967000+00:00) : I don't understand why EE said his team would consist of unknown players lol

71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T19:42:47.802000+00:00) : cuz angular 1 sucks
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T19:41:41.055000+00:00) : you could use paper js to create shape objects
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T19:39:28.672000+00:00) : you would also use css most likely
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T19:39:13.684000+00:00) : but if you are just using css you can just set distances in %
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T19:38:54.370000+00:00) : sass lets you use math and functions and it compiles down to css

71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:42:35.983000+00:00) : hopefully what a good game looks like
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:42:29.710000+00:00) : i think nintendo's will be a mainstream game which will show people
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:42:13.089000+00:00) : well not mainstream
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:41:53.632000+00:00) : they arent popular though
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:41:18.900000+00:00) : they are pretty good
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:41:14.484000+00:00) : yeah

71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:40:08.104000+00:00) : a game called Zenge
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:38:31.040000+00:00) : which isnt a big deal if i lose interest since that happens with every game but i mean these arent even memorable
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:37:58.220000+00:00) : even these games though lose my interest after a while
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:37:34.749000+00:00) : i frequently look for stuff that's good
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:37:26.588000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:37:10.114000+00:00) : idk probably 2 weeks ago
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:36:24.890000+00:00) : there aren't any games like that other than minecraft
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:36:12.710000+00:00) : the market needs someone like nintendo to prove that a well-polished, paid game can still be successful on the app store
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:35:05.056000+00:00) : im not denying that there were good games, but there just arent good games anymore
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:33:54.071000+00:00) : im just sad now that the most successful business model today encourages poor game design when there's so much potential
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:32:55.207000+00:00) : yeah and i played it in middle school, it's a classic. back then you would pay 7 bucks for the entire game and actually get a good produc
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:32:00.302000+00:00) : and notice that pvz 2 went to the freemium model
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:31:47.555000+00:00) : pvz is great but was also a pc release
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:31:31.602000+00:00) : it's like these filthy casuals cant appreciate good game design
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:31:13.725000+00:00) : a mobile port doesnt count
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:31:02.185000+00:00) : what bothers me is that the most popular games now are the worst ones. if you want something good it takes effort to find
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:30:11.758000+00:00) : in app purchases wasnt a thing
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:30:05.895000+00:00) : back then times were good
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:29:18.870000+00:00) : these days i try most of the popular ones and then i remember they are all the same shitty app
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:29:00.962000+00:00) : i had like two i really liked
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:28:44.111000+00:00) : and thats when i played the most mobile games
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:27:41.129000+00:00) : it's like they pitied the mobile gaming platform and had to show it what happens when you actually try to make a good game
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:26:08.160000+00:00) : doesnt mean i forgive them though
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:25:44.686000+00:00) : it's been like 9 years and nintendo may finally release the first good game on mobile
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:24:45.929000+00:00) : thats not a freemium model or has annoying ads or shitty mechanics
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:24:20.502000+00:00) : plus it may actually be the first high quality mobile game
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:23:47.894000+00:00) : i need to support nintendo
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:22:59.968000+00:00) : keenan i'll have you know im a hardcore gamer and i still plan on purchasing this new mario game
71716577669550080 (2016-09-08T01:21:28.102000+00:00) : uuugggh

71716577669550080 (2016-09-07T17:37:15.792000+00:00) : you can also just mute the channel temporariliy
71716577669550080 (2016-09-07T17:36:19.479000+00:00) : tbh

71716577669550080 (2016-09-07T17:35:06.307000+00:00) : classic ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-09-07T17:32:49.229000+00:00) : 😞
71716577669550080 (2016-09-07T17:31:52.156000+00:00) : i cant believe there's no emoji for disapproval
71716577669550080 (2016-09-07T17:14:32.720000+00:00) : 😔
71716577669550080 (2016-09-07T16:59:05.686000+00:00) : any ring can be of wedding variety and any ring can be a casual ring
71716577669550080 (2016-09-07T16:58:17.460000+00:00) : such rings exist
71716577669550080 (2016-09-07T16:57:54.828000+00:00) : non-decorative but also non-wedding
71716577669550080 (2016-09-07T16:57:39.353000+00:00) : if i had a non-decorative ring it would also go on my ring finger
71716577669550080 (2016-09-07T16:57:06.689000+00:00) : maybe she is compiling wedding dresses for a friend
71716577669550080 (2016-09-07T16:56:21.178000+00:00) : if had a decorative ring i would also put it on my ring finger because any other finger is weird for a ring
71716577669550080 (2016-09-07T16:55:10.706000+00:00) : how do you know it's not just a really decoartive normal ring
71716577669550080 (2016-09-07T16:54:33.550000+00:00) : she seems like the type of person who would wear rings naturally for decoration
71716577669550080 (2016-09-07T16:54:05.417000+00:00) : can you not supress your urges with mental powers

71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:26:25.741000+00:00) : just like the gb micro
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:25:56.558000+00:00) : because the ds lite replaced the original nds while the the 2ds is sold along side the current 3ds
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:25:07.555000+00:00) : just hardware differences
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:24:33.092000+00:00) : the 2ds is identical to the 3ds except it doesnt have a paralax screen
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:23:47.531000+00:00) : the new 3ds has exclusive games, more trigger buttons, extra stick, faster processor, bigger screens, nfc chip, improved 3d effect
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:23:01.644000+00:00) : thats not true even remotely
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:22:26.530000+00:00) : and i didnt include the 2ds
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:22:19.521000+00:00) : no theh gameboy micro is to the advance as the 2ds is to the 3ds
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:21:02.166000+00:00) : yea
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:20:17.223000+00:00) : we are currently on Gameboy 9
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:19:05.987000+00:00) : im going to encode every iteration of the gameboy and the nintendo DS simply as 'Gameboy' so they are more recognizable
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:17:45.783000+00:00) : ronald knows it as Majora
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:16:31.128000+00:00) : and the latter is too long
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:16:23.437000+00:00) : because everyone and their mother knows what an NES is
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:16:15.183000+00:00) : not Nintendo Entertainment System
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:16:09.383000+00:00) : I'm also encoding n8 as NES
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:15:23.763000+00:00) : except maybe the Dreamcast
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:15:19.953000+00:00) : thats because sega stuff isn't well known enough to just call it saturn
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:14:06.934000+00:00) : if you just put Saturn people would be like wtf is saturn, that's a planet
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:13:49.701000+00:00) : Im putting Sega in front of all of Sega's shit so people know what they are
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:13:09.910000+00:00) : and the new one was Xbox One
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:13:03.138000+00:00) : I thought it was Xbox 1
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:12:16.812000+00:00) : what do you call the original xbox now
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:11:18.896000+00:00) : I mean PlayStation

71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:03:52.341000+00:00) : im assuming GEN is sega genesis?
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:03:03.039000+00:00) : second NES
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:02:57.559000+00:00) : s for second
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:02:00.303000+00:00) : would have made more sense to do SN8
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:01:45.333000+00:00) : AH
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:01:23.295000+00:00) : WHAT IS SN
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:00:28.394000+00:00) : the second console must be called N32 because 8*4 is 32
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T03:00:02.656000+00:00) : it's the first console. 8 * 1 is 8. the third console is the nintendo 64. 8 * 8 is 64
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:58:31.920000+00:00) : shit i know why it's called the n8
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:57:53.941000+00:00) : do you think i should encode things as "NES" or "nintendo entertainment system"
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:57:18.885000+00:00) : WTF
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:56:59.506000+00:00) : KEENAN WHAT IS N8
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:56:44.347000+00:00) : no one knows where that comes froms
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:55:14.126000+00:00) : they are just copying from other stack overflow posts
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:54:41.125000+00:00) : bitch everyone knows computer science is really just copy and paste from stack overflow
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:54:17.627000+00:00) : and the remaining 20 is actual coding
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:54:10.764000+00:00) : the other 30 percent is spent bug fixing
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:54:00.279000+00:00) : yes but half of the hours are spent researching
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:53:27.098000+00:00) : that would be dumb
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:53:00.367000+00:00) : web design work is never hourly
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:52:35.417000+00:00) : i feel bad because im slow
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:52:26.027000+00:00) : i dont want to until i can prove i have a good product
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:52:13.444000+00:00) : i'll probably get paid but keenan and i havent discussed any real figure yet
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:49:48.604000+00:00) : i literally just started looking at it now because im bored of real work and im going to go to bed soon
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:49:28.226000+00:00) : actually i didnt
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:48:52.829000+00:00) : this isnt for the public good this is for the personal good
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:48:12.534000+00:00) : WHY ISNT IT PS1
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:47:49.550000+00:00) : wtf is PSX

71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:43:47.091000+00:00) : the other way to deal with that is exit discord
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:42:55.313000+00:00) : im no sex expert but im pretty sure that's not what it looks like
71716577669550080 (2016-09-06T02:40:17.604000+00:00) : what is that
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T16:54:09.935000+00:00) : 😉
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T16:50:20.342000+00:00) : yeah i would consider myself part german
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T16:49:41.691000+00:00) : mercy was probably born in germany with a german family and then moved to switzerland for work
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T16:48:11.708000+00:00) : north america
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T16:48:06.376000+00:00) : a canadian is american
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T16:47:40.228000+00:00) : her last name is german
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T16:47:13.236000+00:00) : i dont care
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T16:46:18.439000+00:00) : she speaks german
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T16:44:59.180000+00:00) : https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/518y78/100_german_booty/
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T16:43:32.335000+00:00) : damnit there was a post on the overwatch subreddit titled "100% German booty" and I thought it was going to be about mercy but it was about reinhardt...
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T15:00:37.722000+00:00) : I can't fix it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T15:00:10.978000+00:00) : Unfortunately my brain is wired wrong and an A means more to me than money
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T14:58:33.196000+00:00) : I'm in that phase of programming where i can't stop thinking about search algorithms and it's distracting me from real homework
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T06:05:42.629000+00:00) : the only difference is now you dont have the server slowdown of fetching the data
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T06:05:06.401000+00:00) : angular is all client side
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T06:05:00.837000+00:00) : the search algorithm speed is going to depend on their computer regardless
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T06:03:45.833000+00:00) : keenan why do you have twice as many baseball games as you do mario games
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T06:02:04.509000+00:00) : it's also only 2.4 mb so at most it will take as long to load as a normal size image
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T06:00:55.445000+00:00) : i wonder if the browser caches the json file too
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:59:56.180000+00:00) : even though there are 12,000 objects in it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:59:24.857000+00:00) : i really love how fast searching through a plain json file is
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:59:00.361000+00:00) : i dont know how their server is configured and if i can run pyhton scripts on it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:54:52.373000+00:00) : i have a python script which generates json from their stock database
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:54:28.192000+00:00) : keenan or someone will upload a new json file every week
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:54:04.500000+00:00) : it's also an http call to a local location so it doesnt take any time
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:53:22.701000+00:00) : because http allows you to read the file as an observable
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:50:01.987000+00:00) : which i make an angular http ccall to
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:49:06.066000+00:00) : only a json file
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:46:42.127000+00:00) : but yeah i can rank by number of matching keywords if necessary
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:46:02.758000+00:00) : well the probably wont even be a keyword
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:42:35.961000+00:00) : it's mostly going to be filters
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:42:28.083000+00:00) : i dont think i'll have to sort anything besides titles by alphabet and price
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:41:54.999000+00:00) : it matters to for code readability and for the ability to implement modern design patterns
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:39:05.484000+00:00) : it's some ugly shit.
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:38:08.945000+00:00) : here's the javscript equivalent of that same file
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:36:43.031000+00:00) : javascript is really shitty for building large applications because it lacks a module system, classes, type declarations, etc
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:36:08.573000+00:00) : because typescript makes a lot more sense
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:35:13.903000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:35:11.371000+00:00) : thats typescript which compiles down to javascript
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:34:25.681000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:33:11.670000+00:00) : so you dont end up wth languages like java which are way too verbose
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:32:51.664000+00:00) : only in typscript
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:32:24.450000+00:00) : (args)=>{ body } is the shorthand form
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:31:46.100000+00:00) : it's just an unnamed function
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:31:34.899000+00:00) : lambda functions in javascript look like (function(args){ body })()
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:31:08.470000+00:00) : no it's just shorthand
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:30:54.830000+00:00) : item is the arg, the stuff after the => is the function body
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:30:32.411000+00:00) : lambda
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:30:12.255000+00:00) : return items.filter((item)=> item.itemName.toLowerCase().indexOf(query) !== -1);
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:30:02.593000+00:00) : it's pretty pro
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:29:58.167000+00:00) : do you want to see my current search logic
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:27:34.087000+00:00) : i didnt read too much on it
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:27:21.831000+00:00) : apparently a sorting filter requires things that cant be compressed
71716577669550080 (2016-09-05T05:27:04.863000+00:00) : like compressed

71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T16:58:01.306000+00:00) : how risky is buying a pre-ownded game from game world
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T16:57:03.230000+00:00) : i dont understand how a pre-owned game is only 5 dollars cheaper
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T16:57:01.820000+00:00) : i know
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T16:55:45.658000+00:00) : but im sure it's in stock at some best buy store just not near bloomington
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T16:54:46.013000+00:00) : does that still count
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T16:54:43.343000+00:00) : it's listed on their website though
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T16:54:27.026000+00:00) : i mean bestbuy has the pre-ownded version for 20 bucks but it's not able to be shipped and it's not in stock in any nearby stores

71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T16:52:21.048000+00:00) : but it's not a nintendo select
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T16:51:31.927000+00:00) : how come gameworld has a used copy for $33 but bestbuy's used copy is $20
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T16:49:02.324000+00:00) : how risky is buyin a used 3ds game from game world

71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T16:42:49.796000+00:00) : maybe it will even have benefits
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T16:42:19.929000+00:00) : maybe if you become good enough friends she will become unmarried

71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T01:04:53.637000+00:00) : actually they can read the history, it's not revealing anyway
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T01:03:56.152000+00:00) : messages have to be deleted one by one
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T01:02:47.261000+00:00) : i censored that
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T01:02:38.480000+00:00) : shh

71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T01:01:09.273000+00:00) : really?
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:55:38.217000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:51:55.374000+00:00) : give me a hexcode
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:50:52.129000+00:00) : i can do that by assigning you to a role that does nothing but alter color
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:50:29.744000+00:00) : do you want your name to be a specific color
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:48:14.868000+00:00) : there was one point for me when message history seemed like it was gone too but eventually it came back
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:47:15.549000+00:00) : because you have permissions
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:47:07.650000+00:00) : you might have to restart discord
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:46:31.854000+00:00) : but you should still be able to see message history
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:46:24.524000+00:00) : so everything is secret now
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:46:19.893000+00:00) : but anyway, i disabled message history for the main channel
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:45:20.404000+00:00) : you can kick/ban me im pretty sure
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:45:14.014000+00:00) : yes but the only thing i can do that you guys cant do is change who is owner
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:44:34.389000+00:00) : ?
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:43:34.161000+00:00) : for the first few days i just wanted it to be clear what it was for
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:43:09.559000+00:00) : i just named it that
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:42:57.442000+00:00) : ok good

71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T16:40:20.592000+00:00) : we dont use this chat anymore
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:42:48.856000+00:00) : because you are an admin
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:42:34.800000+00:00) : you might have to restart discord
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:42:27.504000+00:00) : thats what admin only is for
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:41:31.667000+00:00) : because i realized anyone like my brother or one of his friends can come in here and read our weird ass conversations
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:41:10.563000+00:00) : i know im experimenting with roles
71716577669550080 (2016-08-31T00:40:05.503000+00:00) : now do you?
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:32:12.314000+00:00) : yeah if you had the foresight to do that because they stopped you from buying battle passes on the 13th
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:19:46.534000+00:00) : jsut sell the chests
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:19:42.881000+00:00) : the the chances are slim even for the lowest level of rarity
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:19:28.937000+00:00) : 200 dragon claw hooks represent less than 5% of the total available drops for that item
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:19:01.879000+00:00) : scroll down to the tust of benefactor part
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:18:45.943000+00:00) : https://www.dota2.com/international/battlepass/
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:18:36.328000+00:00) : yeah they will because only 25x20 were put out
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:17:59.404000+00:00) : oh yeah dont open the chest
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:15:53.857000+00:00) : http://i.imgur.com/L3YS69O.png
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:15:49.044000+00:00) : also valve made a golden version of the bzz set that is the rarest drop
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:14:55.181000+00:00) : because i got the normal rare items occassionally
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:14:45.557000+00:00) : no but i doubt normal rare items are the same rarity as the normal rare items in the immortal chests
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:13:26.559000+00:00) : like not very rare or extremely rare or ultra-rare, just rare
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:13:12.266000+00:00) : like the dragonclaw hook is 150 dollars and apparently only a rare drop
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:12:49.393000+00:00) : there are a lot of possible rare drops in this benefactor chest and if you do get one of them it will be worth a lot more than the chest
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:12:14.058000+00:00) : you can just to see
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:12:03.772000+00:00) : you know more about how the steam market works
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:11:53.260000+00:00) : idk
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:11:34.897000+00:00) : so unless you think you are going to get a drop worth more than the selling price of the chest
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:11:15.322000+00:00) : definitely not worth it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:11:12.538000+00:00) : i opened mine and got 3 basic drops, worth about 1 dollar combined
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:10:29.593000+00:00) : if you look at the reddit link there's a list of drops and their rarities
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:10:18.975000+00:00) : yes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:09:51.224000+00:00) : they are only an hour old as of now
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:09:39.101000+00:00) : but it will probably go down fast as more people open dota and get theirs
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:09:27.709000+00:00) : around 4 dollars
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:08:47.117000+00:00) : https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/50davy/dota_2_update_main_client_august_30_2016/
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:08:37.970000+00:00) : right now each one is worth 4 dollars
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T22:08:33.121000+00:00) : you should sell your trust of the benefactor chests before the price goes down too much
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T21:41:02.822000+00:00) : Definitely interested.
71716577669550080 (2016-08-30T21:37:11.978000+00:00) : But is there a registration fee?

71716577669550080 (2016-08-27T20:45:35.983000+00:00) : if a team like alliance isnt really getting results then players should want to leave to new teams. but they dont because they get a decent salary even without results. if the organization leaves then there's no incentive to stick together
71716577669550080 (2016-08-27T20:27:40.153000+00:00) : which could explain why zai and fear were removed

71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:59:46.537000+00:00) : foreign languages are just too much work compared to computer languages
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:57:53.378000+00:00) : every time i have to think about foreign language i regret not taking german

71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:56:31.161000+00:00) : i feel bad for him
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:56:19.985000+00:00) : tommy dedeck was in my latin class semester
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:56:02.918000+00:00) : im sure everyone gets angry but most can at least be respectful about it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:55:05.686000+00:00) : it's just as bad
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:54:54.089000+00:00) : but other people cant just ignore him they have to make a dumb remark at everything he says
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:54:20.903000+00:00) : and im pretty sure the rest of us were too
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:54:13.421000+00:00) : im really good at ignoring jacob bissey
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:53:48.757000+00:00) : no in my latin class that i dropped
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:53:15.568000+00:00) : i couldn't tell what was worse, the fact that jacob bissey was in my class or the fact that there were 3 idiots who always made snarky comments or whispered to each other every time jacob talked
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:51:25.427000+00:00) : so i'll just wait another semester to take it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:51:20.061000+00:00) : because my class had the same annoying people as last semester
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:51:09.643000+00:00) : i literally just dropped latin
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:51:03.599000+00:00) : you just got to dodge
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:49:37.078000+00:00) : in small class sizes you dont really get unmotivated people
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:49:18.617000+00:00) : in lectures though it is easier to ignore people you dont like
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:48:30.183000+00:00) : you just have to take small class sizes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:47:29.216000+00:00) : ive never had to deal with business major classmates
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:43:57.573000+00:00) : well yeah thats the point we were discussing in my class with clara, in general college gives you a lot more freedom with how you choose to learn the material
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:42:29.148000+00:00) : apush was all notes and thats just not how i learn
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:42:14.752000+00:00) : if i took history now i might be able to do well
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:41:16.301000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:39:06.770000+00:00) : someone should teach a class on note taking  because if i could take notes i could do this stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:37:25.339000+00:00) : fucking hard
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:37:09.710000+00:00) : on Electriciy and magnetism in AP physics i also got a 2
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:35:54.894000+00:00) : in ap us history i got an A but i got a 2 on ap test which many people said was the easiest one
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:35:27.814000+00:00) : in college latin i got a but it was much easier

71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:34:20.881000+00:00) : for example history or physics or latin
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:33:36.630000+00:00) : yeah the things i suck at i dont get a's in
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:32:51.855000+00:00) : thats not true there are many things i suck at
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:30:58.900000+00:00) : i wish i took notes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:30:42.230000+00:00) : i think those two things are basically the same in this context
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:29:55.805000+00:00) : they definitely speed it up

71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:29:06.847000+00:00) : the homework and quizzes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:29:01.876000+00:00) : idk the readings
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:28:00.463000+00:00) : im pretty sure not taking notes makes you have to study more

71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:13:59.832000+00:00) : this dude is definitely a support
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:12:14.532000+00:00) : i only play games that have new heroes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:03:41.145000+00:00) :

71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T01:02:52.021000+00:00) : you're right i just tested it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T00:58:51.194000+00:00) : Black King Bar lets Underlord sustain himself longer in fights, and can prevent his Dark Rift from being interrupted.
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T00:57:52.140000+00:00) : not according to the wiki
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T00:57:42.105000+00:00) : well if he's a core he's one that can build utility items
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T00:57:06.283000+00:00) : his ult can be canceled with stuns
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T00:50:27.266000+00:00) : the other thing is that i dont really think he fits into any role but im guessing he would be support
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T00:49:07.586000+00:00) : i feel like it would be an aoe base relocate then
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T00:48:40.443000+00:00) : oh then that would be good
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T00:42:23.233000+00:00) : his ult seems really weak considering the cooldown
71716577669550080 (2016-08-24T00:40:01.492000+00:00) : He seems pretty weak

71716577669550080 (2016-08-20T03:07:44.688000+00:00) : also most non-usb headsets come with an adapter like that
71716577669550080 (2016-08-20T03:07:31.709000+00:00) : there are also usb headsets
71716577669550080 (2016-08-20T03:07:16.083000+00:00) : desktops typically have separate speakers/mic and laptop ports are combo because they are smaller and dont usualy have that stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-08-20T03:06:47.589000+00:00) : it's a standard thing
71716577669550080 (2016-08-20T03:04:28.491000+00:00) : You're trying to plug a combo mic/sound plug into just a headphone jack

71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T17:21:32.998000+00:00) : the best star fox game is super smash bros melee

71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T17:19:00.738000+00:00) : it's okay they live in smash bros now
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T17:11:09.378000+00:00) : rip
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T17:10:16.738000+00:00) : no\
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T17:08:54.477000+00:00) : cuz purple is a nicer color for lights
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T17:06:24.557000+00:00) : ican make my computer change colors but i like it on purple
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T17:02:57.076000+00:00) : you can probably have it slowly cahnge between all the colors
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T17:00:41.185000+00:00) : to whatever you want
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T17:00:34.742000+00:00) : apparently the msi card has the white LED light on the side that you can change the color of in software
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:53:58.057000+00:00) : it could be useful
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:53:55.384000+00:00) : like running a game on one monitor and a fullscreen stream on another
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:53:34.734000+00:00) : for rendering or editing video yes a graphics card is nice
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:50:48.524000+00:00) : oh i guess also the 8gb might be slightly better at powering more than one monitor if you ever do that
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:50:18.608000+00:00) : if your display is dvi idk
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:49:55.924000+00:00) : the reference card doesnt have dvi
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:49:48.119000+00:00) : and has a dvi port
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:49:41.601000+00:00) : yes you can tell because it's not just a rectangle
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:47:52.152000+00:00) : eventually games will use higher quality textures and even if you arent changing the screen resolution the high quality textures will require more ram
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:47:22.793000+00:00) : it really depends on the reviewer and the user whether they think the extra 4GB is worth it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:47:03.635000+00:00) : it will be more future proof
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:46:51.243000+00:00) : and the difference is usally 5-7 fps more
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:46:35.249000+00:00) : i mean you can look at the benchmark charts in these reviews
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:44:09.847000+00:00) : yes but you shouldn't need to overclock it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:33:48.303000+00:00) : this is a third reviewer and these are his conclusions
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:33:39.001000+00:00) : ok read this page https://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/msi_radeon_rx_470_gaming_x_8gb_review,34.html
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:29:37.871000+00:00) : im not sure about that but his argument may be legit
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:29:27.779000+00:00) : the second reviewer says that 8gb is pointless on a rx 470 because the card runs out of horsepower before the extra texture maemory would be required
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:26:47.048000+00:00) : the second reviewer takes issue with the fact that the 8gb model of the 470 is more expensive than some 4gb models of the 480
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:25:57.656000+00:00) : here's one for the 8gb http://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/zardon/msi-rx-470-gaming-x-8g-review/
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:25:43.315000+00:00) : heres a review for the 4gb model http://www.notebookcheck.net/MSI-Radeon-RX-470-Gaming-X-4-GB-Review.171114.0.html
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:24:06.132000+00:00) : more VRAM means you can load sharper textures at higher res
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:23:52.730000+00:00) : VRAM is whats used mainly to store texture data
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:23:33.125000+00:00) : which one you get depends how much you care about resolution
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:23:17.226000+00:00) : there's also a 4GB version that's 40 bucks cheaper
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:23:07.044000+00:00) : hold on
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:22:00.191000+00:00) : it does but the reason they can afford to run at a higher speed is because custom designs always have better cooling systems to make up for it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:21:22.291000+00:00) : usually it's higher than the reference cards
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:21:16.410000+00:00) : boost clock is what the manufacturer set the clock speed to out of the box
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:17:39.726000+00:00) : did you see the benchmark video ronald?
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:16:54.379000+00:00) : the only reason i didnt was because there was a sale for an EVGA card
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:16:37.472000+00:00) : i almost bought an MSI card for my computer so i've done a lot of research on the brand
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:16:14.978000+00:00) : msi's gaming X series is one of the better ones
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:16:02.117000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:15:22.821000+00:00) : no but if you look at the first link to /r/buildapcsales there is an in stock listings
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:13:54.090000+00:00) : it also takes up way less disk space
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:13:45.109000+00:00) : yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:13:04.615000+00:00) : well to change boot time you would have to reinstall windows on the ssd
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:12:33.114000+00:00) : or maybe your laptops drive was just slow as fuck

71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:10:40.491000+00:00) : nice you much have a pretty fast hard drive
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:09:39.900000+00:00) : custom rx 470's are the same price as reference rx 480's and the custom cards are still on par if not better
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:09:00.729000+00:00) : it's like the same performance
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:08:48.237000+00:00) : i sent you a video with benchmarks
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T16:08:34.737000+00:00) : yes

71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T01:51:48.936000+00:00) : I'm busy
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T01:51:19.708000+00:00) : 🥑
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T01:16:29.609000+00:00) : Triggered.
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T01:13:11.181000+00:00) : What is game freak game
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T01:02:47.444000+00:00) : What is game freak fame
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T01:01:15.715000+00:00) : Game freak don't do steam
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T01:00:47.388000+00:00) : Where do you find game freak game
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:58:34.643000+00:00) : Movie shit movie shit movie shit wait what game freak game? movie shit movie shit
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:44:08.847000+00:00) : Well then you need a USB adapter or something
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:43:12.953000+00:00) : Yes if you have Bluetooth on your computer
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:41:37.132000+00:00) : Small fans mean loud
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:41:31.686000+00:00) : Look at the size of the fan in the reference design
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:41:22.141000+00:00) : Faster and more cooling and quieter
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:41:08.770000+00:00) : There's a lot of reviews that don't recommend reference designs because custom  designs are almost always better
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:40:15.759000+00:00) : You want a good graphics card that will last you 4 years or more
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:39:44.232000+00:00) : Took me like 30 min
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:39:20.001000+00:00) : Like the one the guy mentioned
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:39:11.323000+00:00) : And more likely to have problems
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:39:02.048000+00:00) : Not as good
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:38:56.209000+00:00) : You probably held a reference design one
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:37:49.032000+00:00) : I'll play tonight
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:37:23.185000+00:00) : Look at a comparison between that and the 480
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:37:07.325000+00:00) : In stock and same price as the msi Rx 480
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:36:50.525000+00:00) : https://m.newegg.com/Product/index?itemnumber=N82E16814127963&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-Mobile&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-Mobile-_-pla-_-Video+Card+-+Nvidia-_-N82E16814127963&gclid=CjwKEAjwudW9BRDcrd30kovf8GkSJAB3hTxF5IoFkhJA87n7QbOaGpcTIobJs8yyaGNP9bp_8Ko0rBoCCgPw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:34:37.826000+00:00) : Which one
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:34:02.557000+00:00) : The 900 series from Nvidia or the r9 series from Radeon
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:33:36.183000+00:00) : I'll tell you
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:24:48.933000+00:00) : Or you can get one if last year's cards
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:24:31.053000+00:00) : The gtx 1060 is comparable i thought
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:12:07.423000+00:00) : It's cheaper but custom designs are improved in many ways
71716577669550080 (2016-08-19T00:06:54.400000+00:00) : I think the reference design may have been the one with problems
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T23:59:28.095000+00:00) : Like MSI for example improve the cooling a lot by changing the fan from a blower design and adding a new fan
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T23:58:52.028000+00:00) : Manufacturers usually make both the reference design and their own custom design
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T23:58:14.789000+00:00) : That's the reference design you linked
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T23:25:54.793000+00:00) : so beautiful
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T23:25:50.446000+00:00) : https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1271034-REG/msi_radeon_rx_480_gaming.html
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T23:24:04.433000+00:00) : btw since your case is red and black you should get the matching msi card
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T23:23:40.740000+00:00) : you still have to put the graphics card power wires in
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T23:23:20.577000+00:00) : i dont know why it would be bad unless you are worried they would unravel
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T23:05:42.394000+00:00) : pres del
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T23:05:40.946000+00:00) : its saying del for bios
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T23:05:37.237000+00:00) : no wait
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T23:05:32.089000+00:00) : press f9 or 12
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T23:04:41.684000+00:00) : read the motherboard manual for the exact key or just spam all of them
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T23:04:30.926000+00:00) : you need to spam Delete or f2 or f1 or f12 to get in the bios
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T23:04:04.343000+00:00) : this picture looks liek your overwatch settings
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T23:00:07.256000+00:00) : and after windows installs it will be the hard drive
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T22:59:57.679000+00:00) : your boot drive will be the win10 flashdrive
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T22:59:40.291000+00:00) : but does it register your hard drive
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T22:55:44.057000+00:00) : if you got into the bios and it is correctly registering your processor speed, cores, ram speed, and ram amount, and hard drive, then it should be good
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T22:52:18.982000+00:00) : but it's not necessary to have, just if things aren't working it will tell you the error with a beep code
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T22:51:44.991000+00:00) : like it will do one short beep if everything is good
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T22:51:28.282000+00:00) : its useful for diagnosing issues
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T22:51:17.287000+00:00) : oh some motherbaords come with a motherboard speaker that will beep various amounts of time to indicate errors with boot up
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T22:50:36.379000+00:00) : oh thats for the front panel jacks
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T22:49:52.726000+00:00) : do you have windows on a bootable flash drive already?
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T22:32:45.070000+00:00) : So did you plug in the stuff from the front io panel of the case
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T22:32:28.018000+00:00) : Did your motherboard come with a ssmall speaker
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T22:23:43.610000+00:00) : You can test it out even before you put the sides on
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T22:22:24.519000+00:00) : You can yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T22:06:55.659000+00:00) : 1 case fan?
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T22:06:52.270000+00:00) : Send me a picture of the power cable for the two front fans
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T20:26:35.710000+00:00) : I thought they were 4 pin
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:48:00.684000+00:00) : Unlikely
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:46:50.036000+00:00) : Yeah i think it's so you can only plug in one way but I'm not sure
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:41:56.339000+00:00) : It clears space in the front for better air flow
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:41:36.586000+00:00) : Yeah that's what the back is for, all the cables
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:32:48.807000+00:00) : thats how you know
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:32:46.300000+00:00) : to keep dust out of the intake fan
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:32:40.694000+00:00) : there's a dust filter on the bottom of the case
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:32:35.366000+00:00) : the power supply fan is intake so you put it on the bottom
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:31:38.624000+00:00) : at least in most cases
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:31:32.580000+00:00) : it shoould only screw in one way
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:31:19.215000+00:00) : down
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:27:15.393000+00:00) : you'll also have gpu wires
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:27:07.443000+00:00) : yea
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:26:16.423000+00:00) : as long as you got that correct it should be fine
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:26:08.723000+00:00) : there should be a notch in the plug so that it only plugs in one way
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:23:16.638000+00:00) : it might be variable speed control or something
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:23:01.111000+00:00) : yes the 4th prong is optional, some fans have it for other things
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:22:42.904000+00:00) : you put it on the sys fan
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:22:21.432000+00:00) : oh a 3 will plug into a 4
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T18:21:57.677000+00:00) : then they probably use molex which is on the power supply
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:50:04.034000+00:00) : no it's good so that you dont drop screws on the pcb circuit board
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:49:02.981000+00:00) : it really ruins binge watching
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:48:56.816000+00:00) : i really hate when shows do a 1-2 minute "previously on" segment before it starts
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:45:18.041000+00:00) : one or both of the case fan wires might plug into the motherbaord too for power
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:44:55.330000+00:00) : there will be a lot more
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:44:50.539000+00:00) : you can zip tie all the wires later
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:44:18.359000+00:00) : also if you still ahve that anti-static plastic wrap the motherboard came in, it's good practice to build on top of it because it's anti static and shit
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:43:01.327000+00:00) : i/o panel in case first
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:41:58.843000+00:00) : so you can slot the i/o panel into it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:41:48.661000+00:00) : but you want to put the back panel in first
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:41:38.259000+00:00) : but yeah the mother board fits on top of the mounts
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:41:24.729000+00:00) : lol the single ram looks weird
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:38:38.092000+00:00) : the case and/or motherboard
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:38:25.769000+00:00) : the motherboard should have
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:38:14.647000+00:00) : and screw it into the mounts
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:38:08.841000+00:00) : they stay in there and you put the motherboard on top
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:37:52.581000+00:00) : those look like they are just mounts
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:36:05.075000+00:00) : what do you mean
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:35:19.731000+00:00) : nvm i forgot you are using stock cooler
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:31:23.329000+00:00) : you put the motherboard in the case before you put the heat sink on right?
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:30:40.157000+00:00) : butt he stickers labeling it can stay on
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T17:30:29.761000+00:00) : only if it's like that plastic wrap stuff you are suuposed to peal off

71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T16:11:50.351000+00:00) : the skeleton king in the castle is why he no longer exists in dota

71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T16:10:30.253000+00:00) : instead of the same play of the game soundtrack over and over again

71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T15:04:17.900000+00:00) : our lord and savior
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T15:04:01.980000+00:00) : still not as good as the icefrog
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T15:02:27.999000+00:00) : part of the reason i got it was because they promised they would continually update it and do free DLC and not do that greedy shit they do with their other games
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T15:01:55.796000+00:00) : what do you mean
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T14:58:39.374000+00:00) : hearthstone is a little too much RNG but thats true of every card game so im fine with it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T14:58:20.281000+00:00) : hots is an easy game made for children and should not be competitive either
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T14:58:02.888000+00:00) : starcraft and hearthstone are fine
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T14:56:43.146000+00:00) : it's definitely not ready yet
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T14:56:20.004000+00:00) : with a pro scene
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T14:56:12.967000+00:00) : I also sitll dont believe overwatch should be a competitive game
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T14:55:35.902000+00:00) : i dont think this shit matters at all in pubs
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T14:52:30.840000+00:00) : yeah but they shouldn't just rotate out the two strong characters at the top, everything should be viable
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T14:46:16.894000+00:00) : but that aint evena normal curve
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T14:44:35.665000+00:00) : and then you have dota where 105 out of 110 heroes were picked in the international
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T14:41:34.165000+00:00) : ?
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T14:40:22.172000+00:00) : its okay keenan a new overwatch short about bastion comes out at noon
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T13:48:53.307000+00:00) : You at least for practice
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T13:48:38.849000+00:00) : Idk if i should feel more bad for you or the store because it's their loss
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T13:47:49.943000+00:00) : I would consider it good practice
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T13:46:15.873000+00:00) : This is more hilariously dumb than sad
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T13:45:27.829000+00:00) : Lol
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T13:45:02.764000+00:00) : That's like the stupidest reason ever
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T13:44:25.118000+00:00) : :(((((
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T13:36:27.591000+00:00) : It also bothers me that they nerfed stuff about him that it took skill and practice to do. So basically if you're really good at genji you were nerfed but if you weren't it doesn't matter much
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T13:34:38.505000+00:00) : That was too much
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T13:34:33.838000+00:00) : Maybe everything but the ultimate nerf
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T13:33:11.932000+00:00) : Nerf
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T13:33:04.386000+00:00) : Also i feel like the only need genji needed was the dash not triggering junkrat trapa
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T13:31:26.413000+00:00) : Start the ult
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T13:31:17.483000+00:00) : It does but the projectile you throw to start the hot doesnt
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T13:30:11.190000+00:00) : I bet that guy Geoff literally played one game of mei, tried to ult, it bounced off a Reinhardt sheild, so he got pissed and changed it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T13:27:23.018000+00:00) : And their "developer comments" make their changes soumd even stupider. They don't need a shitty justification for every change they make in their own game
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T13:21:59.181000+00:00) : They need their own icefrog
71716577669550080 (2016-08-18T13:21:51.021000+00:00) : I feel like blizzard sucks at balancing things

71716577669550080 (2016-08-17T02:31:55.296000+00:00) : it's definitely not something original that reddit has done

71716577669550080 (2016-08-17T02:30:54.552000+00:00) : i love how the whole thing was started by a guy who was drunk and commented on reddit
71716577669550080 (2016-08-17T02:22:48.520000+00:00) : apparently it's a reverse hybrid map, so payload first, then control point
71716577669550080 (2016-08-17T02:22:28.060000+00:00) : no that map isnt supposed to come until september

71716577669550080 (2016-08-14T22:13:29.035000+00:00) : nvidia's stock cards often have problems too but the custom manufacturers often fix them

71716577669550080 (2016-08-14T00:00:25.208000+00:00) : DC outdrafted them so hard
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:52:21.267000+00:00) : although wings would have decent late game if silencer could not fall behind in farm
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:51:35.729000+00:00) : ronald is always wrong about who has better late game
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:50:55.552000+00:00) : storm is their only real lategame
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:50:45.490000+00:00) : silencer is falling behind in farm and has no farming mechanism
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:50:30.410000+00:00) : void + timber is realyl good

71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:49:26.025000+00:00) : "i feel like dc lost already"
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:44:54.593000+00:00) : i dont know how players handle the pressure
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:44:45.226000+00:00) : damn
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:44:43.879000+00:00) : so this is a 6 million dollar series
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:43:27.603000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:42:46.778000+00:00) : you have to time it so the tp completes at the exact same time as the return completes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:42:29.737000+00:00) : no because the return to relocate cancels the tp
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:41:48.082000+00:00) : yeah but it's literally a 0.1 second window
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:41:30.178000+00:00) : or egm

71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:41:24.597000+00:00) : ive only ever seen one player do it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:41:19.718000+00:00) : its really hard to time it right
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:40:19.171000+00:00) : now thats a pretty good use of pudge hook
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:37:34.736000+00:00) : wings didnt ban it because they think they can counter it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:36:57.809000+00:00) : the only team where timber is first ban is DC
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:36:36.798000+00:00) : mirana is good no matter who the palyer is
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:36:29.210000+00:00) : timber is only good if the palyer is good
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:36:02.012000+00:00) : yes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:35:54.548000+00:00) : its like asking how is dk armor passive or visage armor passive balanced
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:35:40.358000+00:00) : if he didnt have that he would be shit
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:35:03.162000+00:00) : maybe their support players cant play pudge
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:34:56.714000+00:00) : he can, i wonder why more teams dont pick him
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:34:43.251000+00:00) : their the only team that realizes support pudge is legit
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:34:30.028000+00:00) : but the pudge is normal for wings
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:33:32.222000+00:00) : i think the core silencer is a good timber counter
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T23:32:42.868000+00:00) : i cant belive im seeing a core silencer and a core skywrath in the same game

71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T02:22:44.479000+00:00) : PL is very similar to what i think monkey King will be like
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T02:22:04.039000+00:00) : No one expected valve to actually make monkey King but it was a rumored hero that they were working on back in dota 1. No one expected it because after the phantom lancer rework they basically combined him with monkey king
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T02:20:46.906000+00:00) : His intro video is almost as cool as wyverns was

71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T02:13:21.799000+00:00) : I don't even know what to do we've never gotten a truly new hero before
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T02:13:07.376000+00:00) : No one expected this
71716577669550080 (2016-08-13T02:11:53.200000+00:00) : Ask Ronald he's the mccree expert

71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:51:06.743000+00:00) : they would be good at drafthing they just need a strong in-game leader
71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:50:25.924000+00:00) : all of them are very smart theoretical dota minds
71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:50:16.080000+00:00) : or bulba
71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:50:14.439000+00:00) : i think aui or EE would captain
71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:50:00.579000+00:00) : i mean that was a good team
71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:49:11.771000+00:00) : c9 2.0
71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:49:08.099000+00:00) : good team
71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:49:04.074000+00:00) : it just needs to be EE, aui, bulba, pie, rtz
71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:48:01.888000+00:00) : puppey is too controlling, selfish, and stubborn
71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:47:19.345000+00:00) : kemal, matt, puppey, all are bad management
71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:46:57.029000+00:00) : they really suck
71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:46:54.499000+00:00) : secret need to reform without puppey and the rest of secret's management
71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:46:34.749000+00:00) : notail wasn't sure about them staying together which means probably a change
71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:46:14.154000+00:00) : yeah probably you can tell from og's exit interview
71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:45:28.162000+00:00) : also since they've done a good job at keeping the all star match a secret it's probably going to be something good
71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:40:53.300000+00:00) : they deserve it so much after getting booted from secret after winning shanghai
71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:40:26.121000+00:00) : which is amazing

71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:38:09.810000+00:00) : i just remember notail and rotk laying on the floor together
71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:37:36.842000+00:00) : probably but all star matches are supposed to be fun not try hard
71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:37:12.066000+00:00) : while everyone was playing around with techies/tusk/ and tiny toss

71716577669550080 (2016-08-12T01:35:41.792000+00:00) : i think it might have been an all star match for some other tournament

71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T21:13:17.406000+00:00) : moo interview
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T21:13:00.491000+00:00) : most of the viewers know them by their screen names but a lot of these guys are all good friends in real life so occassionally they use real names
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T21:12:23.104000+00:00) : sometimes they use real names
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T21:12:00.172000+00:00) : call names?
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T21:11:16.459000+00:00) : team revenge is really getting revenge
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T21:09:16.254000+00:00) : its more like a ...gg because of how long it's taking tnc to call it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T21:06:21.418000+00:00) : pro escape

71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T21:05:08.678000+00:00) : lol the position 5 wyvern is more farmed than TNC's void
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T21:04:42.549000+00:00) : he tunes in for 5 seconds which is enough to tell that it's gg
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T21:04:31.012000+00:00) : yeah

71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T21:01:23.323000+00:00) : you need to find out where he is now and say by to him

71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:57:35.233000+00:00) : https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/7/7f/Dkseer_attack_10.mp3
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:56:15.555000+00:00) : holy shit demon almost stole that
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:55:59.161000+00:00) : tnc has a really good draft for rosh though
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:55:29.381000+00:00) : decently early yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:55:05.706000+00:00) : ronald you just dont like him because you play morphling
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:54:41.986000+00:00) : https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/c/c0/Dkseer_kill_01.mp3
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:54:15.082000+00:00) : lol i just checked dark seers voice lines, he literally has 5 or 6 that are racist against round heads
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:53:28.991000+00:00) : faceless void is awesome
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:53:24.621000+00:00) : thats not true
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:52:17.110000+00:00) : hes the purple short guy with a pointy head
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:51:33.595000+00:00) : dark seer is racist against people who have round heads
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:50:55.777000+00:00) : his most played hero
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:50:50.900000+00:00) : moo is dark seer
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:50:31.745000+00:00) : who did you predict ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:50:27.319000+00:00) : yes it's game three
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:49:45.171000+00:00) : just like mei, a lot of people find wyvern annoying
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:48:50.684000+00:00) : and only makes the immune to physical damage, not all damage
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:48:40.150000+00:00) : cold embrace is basically mei's ice heal thing but can be used on other people
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:48:27.309000+00:00) : he lived from because wyvern used cold embrace on him
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:48:09.584000+00:00) : nice arrow from w33
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:46:35.775000+00:00) : but usually that is correlated with winning
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:46:29.387000+00:00) : i mean not win but perform well
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:46:23.587000+00:00) : i get rewards if they win
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:46:16.567000+00:00) : w33ha and misery are in my fantasy draft for today
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:45:59.259000+00:00) : yes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:45:30.073000+00:00) : except for minute 0 where both runes are bounty runes and they are special bounty runes which just give a flat 100 gold
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:45:06.461000+00:00) : one of the psawns will always be a bounty rune which just gives gold an xp (the gold and xp varies depending on the game time, you get more the later the game goes)
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:44:31.089000+00:00) : two runes spawn every two minutes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:44:17.550000+00:00) : no it temporariliy lowers cooldowns and mana costs
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:43:55.127000+00:00) : bounty, dd, invis, haste, illusion, and arcane
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:43:34.518000+00:00) : yea butminute 0 is the exception
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:43:08.615000+00:00) : exepcially this early, you can striaght up buy a bottle or something before the creeps spawn with that kind of money
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:42:44.991000+00:00) : which is why kuku still went for the rune since it's a lot of money for him
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:42:30.815000+00:00) : but alchemist's greevils greed multiplies that by 3 or 4
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:42:15.891000+00:00) : at 0 minutes bounty runes spawn. the bounty runes give 100 gold at the beginning
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:41:28.844000+00:00) : they killed kuku at the rune
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:40:46.351000+00:00) : it is a lot of money for some guy in his late teens or early/mid twenties , likely without a college degree, just playing video games
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:39:57.940000+00:00) : plus you get bonuses for winning prize money of course
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:39:42.211000+00:00) : players on EG or something make 6 figures a year since that team is so successful
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:39:03.371000+00:00) : but when a team gets better results and more sponsorships they start making more
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:38:39.801000+00:00) : when DC first formed i heard each player made like 40k per year
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:38:14.925000+00:00) : the best teams are making like 6 figures per player
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:37:59.045000+00:00) : oh yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:37:36.218000+00:00) : i cant imagine the pressure
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:37:15.299000+00:00) : winner gets 400k more
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:37:04.025000+00:00) : this single game is a 400,000 dollar match
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:34:24.176000+00:00) : i guess i dont like many things on facebook and you dont have a lot of fb friends so my likes are weighted a lot
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:33:49.228000+00:00) : oh lol
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:33:33.530000+00:00) : i present at that conference last semester
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:33:24.062000+00:00) : why do you have a mucsc ad on your facebook
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:30:02.372000+00:00) : you'll be so amazed by that game
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:29:12.696000+00:00) : also keenan at some point you really need to watch a VOD of ehome vs EG game 1
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:28:39.027000+00:00) : game 3 hype
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:26:30.071000+00:00) : i was wondering that at first but then i forgot that clockwerk's voice isn't actually coming from his mouth
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:24:00.315000+00:00) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=757Op_1Ejz0
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:23:52.376000+00:00) : did you see the guy who made a clockwerk puppet
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:20:53.987000+00:00) : thats the type of cosplay i would do
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:20:04.818000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:19:26.364000+00:00) : lol the io cosplay
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:14:26.886000+00:00) : and casted the newbie stream last year
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:14:19.261000+00:00) : purge is the guy who does the weather but he also makes really good dota guides on youtube
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:13:30.279000+00:00) : there was actually one tournament where dire had a 70% winrate or something which is what ronald is making fun of but they patched that pretty quickly
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:12:47.101000+00:00) : lol
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:12:23.191000+00:00) : especially if you know all the storylines
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:12:16.603000+00:00) : at TI the teams always play super well it's always sad no matter who loses
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:10:50.226000+00:00) : momma moo looks so happy
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:09:57.960000+00:00) : that graphi is a roller coaster
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:09:27.973000+00:00) : but the weakness of AA's other skills late game balance it out
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:09:14.232000+00:00) : its probably one of the best ults in the whole game
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:08:47.040000+00:00) : it does some damage every second, prevents you from healing, and automatically kills the enemy heroes caught in it when their hp goes below 12%
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:08:20.505000+00:00) : Ancient apparitions ultimate is a global aoe nuke that you have to aim but it's range is global
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:07:55.834000+00:00) : that was almost a great escape
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:07:51.849000+00:00) : wow
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:06:47.092000+00:00) : silencer's aghs upgrade makes his global silence last longer and it applies aoe damage on it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:06:27.270000+00:00) : which is why alch's networth went down and silencer's went up
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:06:16.253000+00:00) : so alch gifted an aghs to the silencer
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:05:43.812000+00:00) : ember spirit just bought one
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:05:38.117000+00:00) : it's like a 6000 gold item that gives +300 damage but when you die you drop it on the groound and the other team can potentially pick it up
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:05:04.319000+00:00) : you know about rapiers?
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:04:48.639000+00:00) : some beautiful shit

71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:04:32.121000+00:00) : THE SPLITTER
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T20:04:09.802000+00:00) : i want dc to win because Moo's mom and dad came to this event despite not knowing anything about dota and i dont want them to be sad

71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:58:58.491000+00:00) : timbersaw has the best voice lines in my opinion
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:56:39.211000+00:00) : when i do, i play him support and devote all my money to giving my team items
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:56:25.897000+00:00) : i still never play him
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:56:16.512000+00:00) : i never played him lol
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:55:50.965000+00:00) : it took me like 300 hours in dota before i realized alchemist wasnt actually the ogre
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:55:07.405000+00:00) : hes such a cool character too
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:54:48.503000+00:00) : he's a little goblin riding on top of the ogre
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:54:40.720000+00:00) : also if you cant see, alchemist isn't actually the ogre
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:53:35.150000+00:00) : so he starts buying his whole team an aghs
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:53:28.537000+00:00) : you'll hear casters talking a lot about aghanim's upgrades when it becomes super late game and alchemist is shitting too much money to buy stuff for himself anymore
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:51:52.884000+00:00) : so it's more valuable than a normal aghs because normally an item that doesnt give very many stats is kind of a waste of a slot on carries who need a lot of items anywawy
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:51:18.962000+00:00) : alchemist's aghs upgrade is that he can use the aghs on an allied hero and it gifts them the aghs but the gifted aghs doesnt actually take up an item slot
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:50:48.429000+00:00) : most heroes in the games have a possible aghs upgrade
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:50:28.611000+00:00) : it's a 4200 gold item that doesnt give very many stats (you dont really buy it for the stats) but it gives special abilities to some heroes and/or buffs the ult of them. it depends on the hero what effect it has. sort of like hidden power in pokemon
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:49:01.316000+00:00) : are you familiar with aghanims scepter
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:48:45.300000+00:00) : actually yes, but only aclhemist can
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:48:32.990000+00:00) : if he's not like 5k gold ahead of the next carry he's not doing well enough
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:48:03.793000+00:00) : it's balanced by the fact that alchemist needs a lot more gold to compete against other carries
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:47:00.323000+00:00) : at max combo he's getting like 75 gold per creep instead of the normal 40-50
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:46:34.341000+00:00) : the more last hits you get in a row, the more each one becomes worth
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:46:19.315000+00:00) : which basically lets you combo creep last hits
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:46:03.551000+00:00) : his passive ability is called greevils greed
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:45:30.539000+00:00) : which normally happens
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:45:27.042000+00:00) : thats an exemple of an offlaner getting sacked
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:45:13.703000+00:00) : yeah if i remember correctly, timber was a solo offlane against a trilane
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:44:10.406000+00:00) : but definitely not void
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:44:05.961000+00:00) : tracer is arguably sexier than weaver
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:43:45.668000+00:00) : faceless void and weaver are much cooler than tracer though
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:43:12.241000+00:00) : basically
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:42:31.807000+00:00) : not mana or position or anything else
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:42:25.259000+00:00) : faceless void only reverts the hp from 2 seconds ago
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:42:10.150000+00:00) : weaver's ult is called timelapse which brings you back 5 seconds in time, hp, mana, and position included
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:41:49.492000+00:00) : weaver is more like tracer though
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:41:42.318000+00:00) : it also moves his position
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:41:29.366000+00:00) : at max level, every 6 seconds he can time walk which reverts the last 2 seconds of damage
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:41:02.668000+00:00) : kind of
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:40:38.463000+00:00) : faceless void is also a really well designed hero
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:39:51.098000+00:00) : faceless void is pretty good at not having a face
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:39:22.820000+00:00) : just like Axe is pretty good with axe
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:38:57.390000+00:00) : he's pretty good at silencing
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:38:40.441000+00:00) : his primary use is silencing
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:38:15.913000+00:00) : everytime he's near a kill he permanently steals 2 intelligence from them
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:37:58.399000+00:00) : yeah he's a pretty cool hero
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:37:34.796000+00:00) : he's the pink hero on the left side of TNC's hero icons
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:37:13.460000+00:00) : silencer looks sort of like a priest
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:36:21.486000+00:00) : so DC have three heroes with really big teamfight ults, but TNC has a silencer whose ult is a global silence that lasts for 6 seconds or so and it can really counter DC's teamfight ults
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:35:45.977000+00:00) : oh yeah i forgot about silencer
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:35:05.009000+00:00) : earth splitter is personally my favorite looking ability in the game
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:33:31.468000+00:00) : and eldar titan with earth splitter (it's like fissure in pokemon but instead of 100% hp damage it does 30%-50% of your hp as damage depending on the level
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:32:44.122000+00:00) : also keep an eye on the void with chronosphere
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:32:33.077000+00:00) : yeah but i would keep an eye on magnus because he can make really big and flashy plays with his ult
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:31:51.175000+00:00) : zarya's ult is more like dark seer's vacuum
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:31:21.583000+00:00) : rp is a hard stun
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:31:18.002000+00:00) : sort of, zarya's ult still lets you use abilities and attack
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:30:52.091000+00:00) : while they are stunned from the RP
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:30:41.779000+00:00) : so generally you RP heroes to group them toegether and skewer them towards your team
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:30:24.739000+00:00) : he also has an ability called skewer which does what it sounds like,  he skweres people on his horn and pushes them where he wants them to go
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:29:38.132000+00:00) : his ult called reverse polarity is an aoe stun that pulls everyone caught in it to one place
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:28:59.473000+00:00) : magnus
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:27:35.032000+00:00) : he has an ability called reactive armor which is a passive that gives him more armor and more health regen the more people hit him
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:27:12.073000+00:00) : holy shit timber almost lived there
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:17:12.944000+00:00) : there are some really funny but rare dota voice lines
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:16:08.622000+00:00) : it kind of illustrates how many more voice lines dota heroes have than overwatch
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:13:27.982000+00:00) : you have to rewind like 10 minutes from live
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:11:56.681000+00:00) : slark interview https://youtu.be/H08ZEAp5a2M?t=2h16m23s
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:08:02.636000+00:00) : they'll proabbly put the video on youtube in a couple hours
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:07:21.680000+00:00) : holy shit that slark interview was amazing
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:03:12.786000+00:00) : that is known as sunsfanning and may or may not actually happen
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:01:27.735000+00:00) : before TI, nobody knew about TNC and before TI, DC were well known but underperforming a lot and no one expected them to do this well here
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T19:00:51.239000+00:00) : i hope thats enough explanation of the teams
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:59:08.968000+00:00) : oh and i forgot to say that W33ha and Misery were kicked from Secret immediately after they got 1st place at the Winter Major in Shanghai. Which is why it's great that they got their revenge and sent secret to the lower bracket of TI during the group stage
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:57:52.439000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:56:54.924000+00:00) : his face itself is a meme
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:56:51.816000+00:00) : he's also a pretty funny guy and the shit he does and says often become memes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:56:06.840000+00:00) : the team is owned by SUNSfan who got his name by co-owning the most successful dota youtube channel, dotacinema
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:55:19.375000+00:00) : DC is an american team made up of 4 europeans and 1 american (Moo who plays offlane). W33ha (mid) and misery (support) were kicked from secret in an unprofessional fashion and joined resolution (carry) and saksa (support) at the last minute for revenge
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:53:23.734000+00:00) : in probably 10 minutes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:53:19.567000+00:00) : all new players except for demon and most people thought demon was washed out
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:53:06.671000+00:00) : they came out of nowhere besides demon and no one expected them to do well
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:52:52.391000+00:00) : so anyway TNC is a team of 4 random Pinoy players who are new to the scene plus Jimmy "demon" ho who is their captain. Demon moved to the SEA region after almost 2 years of an insuccessful dota career in north america. he was about to give up on dota until he coached and captained the team of brand new players through the open qualifiers and the regional qualifiers for TI.
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:49:54.393000+00:00) : or aoe damage
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:49:48.863000+00:00) : they will become really tanky and TNC have extremely little wave clear
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:49:31.963000+00:00) : it will get harder and harder for TNC to win the later it gets because of naga illusion spam
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:48:46.405000+00:00) : he used one of his best escapes (The waveform) to initiate there and didnt have it off cooldown to escape
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:48:17.056000+00:00) : it's kuku but yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:47:35.127000+00:00) : and she can just split push with them while using the radiance to burn the creep wave down
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:47:10.547000+00:00) : eventually each of her illusions will be as hard to kill as a normal hero
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:46:48.730000+00:00) : naga is almost getting to the point where she is really strong
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:44:21.032000+00:00) : look at dat avg kda
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:43:42.755000+00:00) : proof http://www.dotabuff.com/players/83844576
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:43:02.174000+00:00) : ronald would have killed all 5 and still gotten out
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:42:53.834000+00:00) : this guy isn't as good as ronald as morphling
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:42:22.858000+00:00) : he has 3 different escapes, 4 if you count his blink dagger, and 5 if you count his 4 second stun
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:42:03.296000+00:00) : escape master
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:41:59.998000+00:00) : yeah thats morphling for ya
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:41:08.098000+00:00) : like the 3 sentence version
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:40:47.165000+00:00) : do you want some backstory on each of these teams
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:39:21.704000+00:00) : so they transitioned from early game to mid-game well
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:39:04.115000+00:00) : thats how it should end up
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:39:00.582000+00:00) : and the farm order is 1, 2, 3
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:38:52.030000+00:00) : yeah notice how they passed the batrider
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:38:00.376000+00:00) : that looked bad for TNC but DC just spent a lot of money for two buybacks to hold that
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:36:53.050000+00:00) : as you just saw
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:36:49.764000+00:00) : however the bat and morphling can fly up hill and get pick offs with lasso
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:35:49.639000+00:00) : because DC has so much wave clear
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:35:41.504000+00:00) : its really hard for TNC to get creeps up the highground
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:35:19.262000+00:00) : it is a little bit but if TNC make any mistakes pushing highground it's easy for DC to come back off of it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:34:21.346000+00:00) : their plan is to stall the pushes until their naga can get farmed enough to carry them
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:34:09.166000+00:00) : they are good at stopping pushes with all those abilities
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:33:59.802000+00:00) : DC drafted a lot of anti-push heroes like Kotl with his giant aoe light blast that kills creeps, tusk which is long range shards nuke, and dragon knight with his breathe fire
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:32:54.109000+00:00) : their own late game carry morphling is not good against naga in the late game
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:32:33.596000+00:00) : so this is TNC's best chance
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:32:23.701000+00:00) : but she really sucks before 30-35 minutes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:32:13.490000+00:00) : probably top 3
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:32:06.520000+00:00) : naga siren is one of the strongest heroes late game
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:31:50.819000+00:00) : part of the reason TNC is so aggressive early too is because they are playing against a Naga siren
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:30:43.966000+00:00) : which is why they can push so fast and why bat and morphling can do a lot mor e damage now
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:30:30.027000+00:00) : so their team is 5 ranged heroes and drow is passively increasing the damage of all of them
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:30:04.653000+00:00) : the other think about TNC's draft keenan is the drow ranger buffs the damage of all ranged heroes on their team globally
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:29:30.861000+00:00) : i think so
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:29:23.660000+00:00) : because they might not know they are roshing
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:28:53.735000+00:00) : but not completely because they still ahve morphling for late game insurance
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:28:39.727000+00:00) : this is kind of one of those strategies
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:28:32.961000+00:00) : there are some strategies where you dont pick a lategame hero and focus on dominating the early game
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:27:58.214000+00:00) : however if TNC wins this game really early then it wont matter
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:26:57.232000+00:00) : so TNC needs to make sure their real cores get farm too
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:26:46.163000+00:00) : he becomes more of an initiator late game than a real damage dealer
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:26:32.767000+00:00) : bat does a lot of damage with his firefly right now, but late game magic damage falls off and he's more useful for just his ultimate which can drag a hero after him
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:25:48.790000+00:00) : because those are the two heroes that really do the damage late game
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:25:36.418000+00:00) : so notice how bat is top networth right now but TNC needs to be careful that their morph (pos 1) and their drow (pos 2) still get farm
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:24:41.710000+00:00) : in pub games it's more common
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:24:33.630000+00:00) : he can be played mid or offlane too but it's rare in pro games
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:23:35.696000+00:00) : the supports are almost always the bottom 4 on the list
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:23:24.826000+00:00) : it's a rough ranking of farm priority
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:23:15.201000+00:00) : you can normally tell by the networth list on the side
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:23:05.445000+00:00) : yes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:22:21.590000+00:00) : so the fact that batrider has the most networth in the game right now is really good for TNC
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:22:08.756000+00:00) : but more priority than supports
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:22:01.446000+00:00) : they have a '3' farm priority so after the carry and the mid
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:21:48.377000+00:00) : but the fact that he got a solo kill is really good for someone like him because usually offlaners are sacked
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:21:23.309000+00:00) : well not mid heroes but offlane heroes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:21:13.806000+00:00) : those types of heroes are typically really reliant on xp more than gold
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:21:04.160000+00:00) : but batrider is typically a mid or offlane hero
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:20:21.854000+00:00) : because it's basically free money
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:20:18.532000+00:00) : so when you have a bounty hunter you want to get 3 or 4 people in one kill
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:20:03.211000+00:00) : bounty hunter's ultimate is an ability that gives people who assist in kills a lot more gold
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:19:20.357000+00:00) : so the total xp gain is the same but the gold gain increases when you have more heroes helping
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:19:02.921000+00:00) : if someone assists you, tyou get less xp but still the same amount of gold and the person who helped you is also getting some gold
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:18:35.656000+00:00) : if it's just a solo kill, the killer gets all the xp and a good amount of gold
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:18:19.619000+00:00) : so there are pros and cons to having multiple people invovled in kill vs just a solo kill
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:17:19.231000+00:00) : second most picked hero this tournament
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:17:08.332000+00:00) : batman so strong
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:16:29.758000+00:00) : which is a bad sign
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:16:24.106000+00:00) : but before batrider killed beast without any help
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:16:13.983000+00:00) : the venge just ganked to help the batrider get another kill
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:16:01.216000+00:00) : like this venge
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:15:58.274000+00:00) : normally kills happen in the early game because a support or someone ganks
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:15:40.332000+00:00) : but it's bad because that beast master got solo killed
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:15:22.357000+00:00) : no it's about average
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:14:09.678000+00:00) : no it just means some one peed inside of him
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:12:39.593000+00:00) : ronald stop spewing bullshit, morphling isn't water he's just blue-skinned
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:10:48.206000+00:00) : yes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:10:44.324000+00:00) : his first skill is a pretty big nuke (nukes and magic damage is better early game than late game) and it's also an escape so he can survive in fights
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:10:13.471000+00:00) : late game but he's better in early fights than a lot of carries
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:08:50.564000+00:00) : you can also control the camera yourself and highlight things and read abilities, sometimes thats useful for learning
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:08:28.702000+00:00) : if you watch the game in the dota client you can see it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T18:06:29.083000+00:00) : they usually show the order of the draft on the screen too but they are doing a special production value for TI And dont have room for it

71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T17:53:29.994000+00:00) : she's not a real dota personality
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T17:53:24.350000+00:00) : i mean there's a real reason why and it's not because of her sex

71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T17:43:39.486000+00:00) : but there are other advantages and disadvantages beyond that
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T17:42:24.265000+00:00) : if you choose pick order, you pick first pick or second pick and the other team is left with choosing radiant or dire
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T17:42:02.937000+00:00) : the winner of the coin flip choses side or ppick order. if you choose side you can pick radiant or dir, and the other team chooses wether they pick first or second

71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:46:25.060000+00:00) : only because we are contracting with noblis
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:46:14.355000+00:00) : but for this 2-week data collection thing it's a salary
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:45:53.280000+00:00) : during the summer i need to get grants
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:45:46.777000+00:00) : i only get paid because of a scholarship and even then it' not a real salary
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:45:18.147000+00:00) : you wont get paid much
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:45:01.171000+00:00) : but usually each station has a person for 2.5hrs and there are 4 subjects per station per day
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:44:01.205000+00:00) : no there are 2 other eye tracking stations

71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:43:00.002000+00:00) : i only have to input the final decision and start them out
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:42:48.037000+00:00) : but if they are taking a long time to do a comparison theres not much to do
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:42:25.054000+00:00) : as well as calibrate the eye trackers
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:42:19.449000+00:00) : but during a trial i have to input all their responses and help them use the software
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:41:58.499000+00:00) : they do trials for basically 2.5 hours stragiht each and there are only small breaks in between
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:41:24.004000+00:00) : i just cant really use headphones because i need to be able to hear what they tell me to input
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:40:56.550000+00:00) : ive gotten so good at helping the subjects and calibrating them i can do it while i read or do other things
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:40:30.309000+00:00) : yes but normally it's pretty relaxed
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:39:52.194000+00:00) : no  i still have to run subjects after that until 6

71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:39:06.330000+00:00) : usually im running subjects from 8-6pm which lets me multitask a little bit
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:38:36.481000+00:00) : im giving a workshop from 8-12:30
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:34:15.033000+00:00) : i cant decide if i should stay up for the rest of this series
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:32:57.815000+00:00) : esp considering your price point those are your best options
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:32:33.582000+00:00) : i dont think you can go wrong either way
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:32:23.467000+00:00) : both the corsair case or the rosewill case are good choices
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:31:51.282000+00:00) : i doubt they will know what they are talking about
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:27:38.557000+00:00) : 
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:22:48.840000+00:00) : at least my fantasy isnt ruined because mathmatically they were ahead
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:22:32.882000+00:00) : ehome definitely threw that
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:22:18.418000+00:00) : ugh
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:21:58.170000+00:00) : 4000 gold wasted inventory slot for -15sec respawn time
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:21:18.681000+00:00) : its literally 3 secs per charge
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:19:17.907000+00:00) : why the fuck would you keep that item especially if its at 5 charges or less
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:19:03.514000+00:00) : oh yeah definitely he also kept bloodstone until 60 minutes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:18:07.973000+00:00) : iceiceice could euls that though
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:17:25.011000+00:00) : dagons and eblade on mirana and sd won that game

71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:15:00.273000+00:00) : why did timber go so far out of the base
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:12:25.456000+00:00) : ehome were mathematicalyl ahead the entire game
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:12:15.249000+00:00) : why is this so tense
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:10:25.571000+00:00) : ew bloodlust golems
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:08:47.498000+00:00) : a 5 charge bloodstone aint doing shit for him
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:08:17.739000+00:00) : iceiceice should really replace his bloodstone with dagono 5 or something
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:07:27.388000+00:00) : chakrams automatically come back after a certain distance
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:07:00.009000+00:00) : we really need to do sd morph more
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:03:57.714000+00:00) : this SD is such a big BM counter
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:02:38.608000+00:00) : id call it evenly matched
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T03:02:14.668000+00:00) : uuugh
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T02:54:10.743000+00:00) : dont lul them yet this game is extremely even
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T02:40:56.002000+00:00) : but in general, two good performances across two games would get as many points as one good performance in one game and arguably the former indicates a stronger player
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T02:39:51.149000+00:00) : actually in the group stage it wowuld work since everyone plays equal number of games
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T02:38:58.715000+00:00) : but then you would get a lot of points for one good performance in one game even though the team got eliminated and didnt play any more than 1
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T02:37:54.101000+00:00) : yes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-11T02:35:57.280000+00:00) : but yiu should watch noobfromua highlights for game 2

71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T23:58:25.713000+00:00) : it's QO's signature
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T23:45:56.427000+00:00) : but at least either way its a happy outcome for me
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T23:45:40.113000+00:00) : i should really stop betting against the teams i want to win'

71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:27:29.112000+00:00) : the parts have on board sensors there is software that lets you measure
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:26:41.344000+00:00) : secret literally did that in their game yesterday
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:26:33.004000+00:00) : how is that cheese
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:26:13.283000+00:00) : watch a video on that one
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:26:09.664000+00:00) : higher quality and stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:25:58.642000+00:00) : that corsair case is probably better
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:25:47.127000+00:00) : how can anyone hate og
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:24:50.750000+00:00) : you really need to see build videos specific to your case first
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:24:40.060000+00:00) : i wouldn't recommend buying a case in the store
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:24:12.253000+00:00) : so buying separate fans lets you customize more
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:23:57.175000+00:00) : but they always have many different kinds like silent fans or high airflow and different sizes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:23:37.295000+00:00) : so most manufacturers of cases also make case fans and they usually just put their own brand of case fan pre-installed in their cases
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:22:29.117000+00:00) : well not always
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:21:59.783000+00:00) : the case fans that you buy separately are always better quality anyway
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:21:13.250000+00:00) : ronald you can always start with one case fan and monitor temps and if it's too hot buy an extra
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:19:07.887000+00:00) : but if you want really stylish look at nxzt and phanteks but they are more expensive
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:18:51.367000+00:00) : nice looking
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:18:46.417000+00:00) : they make nice cases
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:18:31.395000+00:00) : i really like corsair
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:18:18.522000+00:00) : they are all good brands except thermaltake
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:17:21.702000+00:00) : kuku is so adorable
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:15:51.238000+00:00) : you need overall ventillation
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:15:12.246000+00:00) : the graphics card has a fan but it will only be drawing in warm air and outputting warmer air if the inside of the case is hot
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:14:22.346000+00:00) : but the motherboard and hard drive produces a lot of heat which dont have fans
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:13:27.185000+00:00) : depends on how hot your parts run
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:11:40.188000+00:00) : PURGE WITH THE WEATHER

71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:05:47.241000+00:00) : ok maybe not
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:04:58.921000+00:00) : you can basically add the bottom 5 together and get drow's networth
71716577669550080 (2016-08-10T01:04:15.797000+00:00) : everyong after darkseer is poor as fuck compared to the top

71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T23:06:34.139000+00:00) : Pos 1 players take the most farm
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T23:06:18.473000+00:00) : Supports and cores are sorted into positions based on how much farm they require
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T23:02:48.236000+00:00) : It's support and core
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T23:02:20.812000+00:00) : There's no offense or defense

71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T22:16:34.736000+00:00) : its like using zenyatta ult while your team is at full hp and no one is damaging them
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T22:15:50.629000+00:00) : it was just universe the rest of the team wasnt there yet
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T22:15:40.498000+00:00) : i dont they they were focusing them in the chrono
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T22:14:36.333000+00:00) : not one, but two oracle ults
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T22:14:27.695000+00:00) : like why would you use oracle ult instantly when they get chronoed at full hp
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T22:14:02.659000+00:00) : did he purposely throw that fight
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T22:13:26.888000+00:00) : chuan used two oracle ults on two heroes with full hp
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T22:13:15.868000+00:00) : wtf............
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T22:12:15.484000+00:00) : eg can always exploit shadow demon illusions on morph
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T22:11:48.859000+00:00) : but they are five seconds
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T22:10:52.024000+00:00) : this game is super close
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:59:08.994000+00:00) : 🐸

71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:43:25.845000+00:00) : as long as they keep killing that timber it's a decent trade because he loses bloodstone charges
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:41:34.225000+00:00) : this kpii dude is like sand king master
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:38:34.196000+00:00) : i feel like morphling is only really picked in combination with shadow demon
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:37:25.287000+00:00) : they make really good cases
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:37:21.214000+00:00) : i would also look in to the cheaper corsair cases
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:37:05.938000+00:00) : neither am i but its by far the best value
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:36:46.779000+00:00) : i dont know whats wrong with the rosewill case
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:35:50.864000+00:00) : the turtles are better than butterflies
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:35:39.288000+00:00) : oh yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:35:02.077000+00:00) : idk alch can give an aghs to all 4 heroes on his team
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:34:47.265000+00:00) : are you watching it muted
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:34:07.248000+00:00) : NEWBEE REVERSE 322!
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:33:38.066000+00:00) : idk i want them or mvp or dc to win
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:31:43.815000+00:00) : but a eg win here will ruin like half of my upper bracket and half of the lower bracket
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:30:57.784000+00:00) : no i had secret losing to dc but as long as DC advances the wrong prediction about secret/lgd doesnt matter much
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:28:17.545000+00:00) : if eg wins it will mess up everything for me. the only other prediction i got wrong was secret/lgd and that can be recovered if DC beats LGD
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:26:41.198000+00:00) : goddamnit how is eg coming back

71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:23:51.158000+00:00) : he's semi-popular
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:23:36.075000+00:00) : no this is the first game ive seen him
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:20:47.773000+00:00) : or maybe its just some random dude casting frmo his computer at home
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:20:36.578000+00:00) : i wonder if that russian stream will jump to the english talent at the event in between matches
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:18:45.689000+00:00) : and are fat
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:18:28.516000+00:00) : and slow
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:18:25.909000+00:00) : and both are tanky
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:18:15.999000+00:00) : yeah both are ideal for close range combat
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:16:21.131000+00:00) : a team incorrectly going to losers throws everything off entirely
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:15:59.517000+00:00) : i really need newbee to win this series for my bracket predictions
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:14:50.853000+00:00) : it's okay you can proabbly read a whole comic during the queue time of a dota game
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:14:05.743000+00:00) : its literally overwatch, there are heroes and ultimates
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:13:30.476000+00:00) : it's ok if it's russian, sometimes i find that i can focus more on what's going on in teamfights without the caster sound sometimes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:12:22.660000+00:00) : is it called alemalk
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:11:51.653000+00:00) : whats it called

71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:10:56.681000+00:00) : ok let me find the hitbox stream
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:10:43.480000+00:00) : goddamnit newbee
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:10:15.288000+00:00) : or azubu. whatever
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:10:08.674000+00:00) : or hitbox.tv
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:10:04.024000+00:00) : what about douyu.com
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:09:25.921000+00:00) : is youtube blocked
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:07:50.431000+00:00) : you could try some chinese stream
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:07:40.453000+00:00) : all the streams are listed on the trackdota app
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:06:50.575000+00:00) : that's pretty entertaining
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:06:46.413000+00:00) : you can at least watch the minimap icons move every 20 seconds in the track dota app
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:06:31.158000+00:00) : but TI ronald
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:05:53.831000+00:00) : you arent going to use 500 mb per week when you are at home or on campus
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:05:30.826000+00:00) : considering you only have like 3 days left in an office space with no wifi you might as well do something with the data you aren't going to use again when you get back home
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:04:19.459000+00:00) : ronald even if you streamed audio only TI for 4 hours straight your data usage would only increase from 1.8 GB to 1.9GB
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:03:17.014000+00:00) : doesnt that data expire after 12 months though
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:02:37.407000+00:00) : i am only on a 6gb plan for one week because my hotel and place last week didnt have good wifi
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:02:05.416000+00:00) : no that only works for 4gb plans and higher
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T21:00:58.466000+00:00) : ronald i have that too and ive passed 2.5 gb twice in two years
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T20:56:35.759000+00:00) : although the app lets you see picks and graphcs and minimap
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T20:56:11.994000+00:00) : you doont even need the trackdota app to do audio only stream, you can just use this http://audiotwitch.tv/dota2ti/
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T20:52:05.948000+00:00) : you can probably assume it's 64kbps audio streeaming which is like 0.48 mb per minute
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T20:49:48.900000+00:00) : no
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T20:16:07.524000+00:00) : there's an app
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T20:15:41.498000+00:00) : and listen to the audio only stream
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T20:15:35.620000+00:00) : use trackdota on your phone
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T20:14:29.594000+00:00) : just use the r/dota2vods
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T20:14:16.409000+00:00) : oh
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T20:14:11.110000+00:00) : why dont you have wifi
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T20:13:55.565000+00:00) : do you not have wifi
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T20:13:34.648000+00:00) : can you not use your phone
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T20:06:39.387000+00:00) : they have lobbies just not custom ones i think
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T20:06:29.693000+00:00) : they proably have some sort of team matchmaking
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T20:00:24.041000+00:00) : like you cant even go into a map by yourself and practice last hits
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:59:50.609000+00:00) : league is like the most popualr esport and it doesnt even have a replay system or sandbox/custom lobby mode
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:59:31.500000+00:00) : it's not just stats
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:56:15.472000+00:00) : but when you look at overwatch and other games like league and HoTS you realize how many features dota actually has that seem like they should be standard but arent
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:54:53.316000+00:00) : yeah they said they're working on it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:54:32.733000+00:00) : but idk that either
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:54:29.146000+00:00) : the same way as the career profile does
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:54:13.556000+00:00) : there's not much they can tap into besides the publically avaailble career profiles
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:53:49.086000+00:00) : because overwatch doesnt provide per match data
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:52:34.042000+00:00) : it rivals dotabuff or yasp and looks really fancy
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:52:15.700000+00:00) : purge just did his weatherman stuff with the new end games stats screen that will be debutting soon
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:51:24.377000+00:00) : i kept bulldog though
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:51:12.774000+00:00) : yeah and most offlaners are like that which is why i recycled them
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:50:41.293000+00:00) : he always makes amazing plays but wont earn a lot of fantasy points since he's not a greedy core
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:49:53.497000+00:00) : yes ehome stomped alliance twice basically
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:49:24.302000+00:00) : then it's proabbly worth it. i have a silver moon but id rather use a regular notail/meracle for that team
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:33:42.498000+00:00) : so if you have a mid or carry it's probably better to use it than an offlaner
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:33:18.051000+00:00) : so i think even if an offlaner like old eleven does really well early ggame, the other two cores will eventually surpass him in kills and networth
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:23:20.064000+00:00) : well everyone on ehome is doing well now, not just eleven
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:15:58.583000+00:00) : my draft for today was iceiceice, old chicken, hao, banana and fly
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:07:40.892000+00:00) : ugh i shouldn't have recycled my old eleven card. i recycled it because it was an offlaner player but in this game right now he has more networth than the safelane and mid as sk
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:01:21.195000+00:00) : ehome mvp and dc
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T19:01:12.595000+00:00) : i think ehome is my favorite team right now

71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T04:03:05.997000+00:00) : probably not
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T04:03:01.989000+00:00) : ugh idk if i should stay up for navi vs liquid

71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T03:03:15.156000+00:00) : http://www.trackdota.com/matches/2558255566
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T02:58:04.950000+00:00) : i even changed my reddit flair from liquid  to escape
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T02:57:55.365000+00:00) : escape gaming obviously
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T02:56:17.118000+00:00) : kick EE -> win TI6
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T02:56:07.440000+00:00) : should have kicked EE
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T02:51:34.369000+00:00) : well i mean they were supposed to lose but it took lgd 50 minutes longer than it should have
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T02:50:17.162000+00:00) : lgd was up like 10-0 in the beginning and have been ahead in networth the entire game but still havent won in 70 min
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T02:49:52.203000+00:00) : more like lgd lul
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T02:43:25.174000+00:00) : oh my god this game
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T01:51:51.003000+00:00) : so  the captain of secret is puppey and the captain of lgd is xiao8. both are legendary captains who have each won a TI before. so this is an interesting game because it's elimination and best of 1, loser gets last place and no matter what one of the most legendary captains is going out early
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T01:47:16.163000+00:00) : it's targeted towards new competitive viewers or people that dont play dota
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T01:46:45.226000+00:00) : usually they do

71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T01:42:38.396000+00:00) : he's playing beastmaster in top lane
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T01:42:28.460000+00:00) : he's named after bulbasaur and graduated from UNC
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T01:42:12.824000+00:00) : so bulba on secret is my favorite player
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T01:40:54.256000+00:00) : because last year and the year before it was gold and purple repectively which looked really nice too
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T01:40:32.138000+00:00) : at first i was hesitant about the crimson theme this year but now i really like it

71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T01:35:51.322000+00:00) : you changed your signature
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T01:15:01.033000+00:00) : Not eating = easy bucks
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T01:12:43.313000+00:00) : So i just learned that my per diem for food is $69 and I've been traveling for 9 days and only have spent $32
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T00:47:38.396000+00:00) : Apparently she was windranger
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T00:47:16.178000+00:00) : Epicenter
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T00:47:12.047000+00:00) : I haven't even seen that part of the opening ceremony though yet i only saw Gabe's part
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T00:45:13.239000+00:00) : Yeah so much that i had to check dota 2 Reddit because i didn't realize that was her
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T00:39:21.102000+00:00) : He's probably a programmer not a public speaker
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T00:37:02.981000+00:00) : I respect him as a billionaire more because of his clothes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T00:36:40.925000+00:00) : Why are his clothes disturbing
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T00:31:16.712000+00:00) : Those would be my millionaire clothes too
71716577669550080 (2016-08-09T00:04:23.583000+00:00) : Wings beat DC too. 2 for 2
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T22:36:40.762000+00:00) : HA i was right, mvp would beat og
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:48:55.017000+00:00) : but when we're actually in game we get similar performance and frame rates
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:48:35.327000+00:00) : it takes my brother 30 seeconds to boot up dota but it takes me 3 seconds because i have an ssd
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:45:55.396000+00:00) : and windows defender works well as long as you're not stupid with what you download
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:45:32.622000+00:00) : i uninstalled norton symantec when i realized it took 5 gb of space
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:45:06.322000+00:00) : it's lightweight
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:45:03.163000+00:00) : no i use windows defender
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:43:09.165000+00:00) : when you download stuff from the internet make sure you do custom  installs onto your seperate  drive
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:42:19.991000+00:00) : steam lets you put games on multiple drives
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:41:38.429000+00:00) : for games other than minecraft its more about load times
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:41:03.698000+00:00) : for minecraft, ssd's make worlds load and render lreally fast because loading chunks is a lot of read operations
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:40:13.770000+00:00) : but for gaming it only affects load times, so if you dont care about load times and dont do a lot of read/write operations than it's not worth it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:39:19.157000+00:00) : ssd is the biggest single performance booster of a computer
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:38:51.351000+00:00) : if the reviews are good, then yes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:38:45.036000+00:00) : so i just checked windows 10 on my laptop is like 60 but thats before I clean up old installations and stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:34:22.385000+00:00) : Windows will be like 30-40 GB max
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:34:10.024000+00:00) : That's probably enough for Windows plus the games you play the most
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:31:27.845000+00:00) : Whatever it is it's still an amazing deal, you'll find cases that are 60 bucks with only one ore installed fan
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:30:53.199000+00:00) : What is it?
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:16:09.152000+00:00) : 25 dollars is an amazing deal
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T21:16:01.435000+00:00) : There's no better valued case than that one
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:46:13.334000+00:00) : the 480 is the premier mid-range amd card right now, anything less could start becoming slow to run newer games in the future.
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:44:28.072000+00:00) : i wouldnt recommend it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:41:54.035000+00:00) : the first thing will probably match your choice of parts better, but the second query would show you specific how your case is designed
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:41:23.555000+00:00) : when you can just search for mid range skylake gaming builds but also search for stuff specific to your case
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:40:55.828000+00:00) : k
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:40:34.636000+00:00) : just search "mid-range skylake gaming build" on youtube
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:40:13.952000+00:00) : i like your parts list but you really need to watch build videos
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:39:04.471000+00:00) : like 1x16 is more expandable but some motherboards could throttle performance or dislike it if theres only ram in one of the two slots
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:38:15.383000+00:00) : i think there are some pros and cons to 2x8 vs 1x16 other than price, so you might want to read up on that
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:37:33.704000+00:00) : is 1x16 cheaper
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:36:42.800000+00:00) : https://www.amazon.com/Rosewill-Black-Gaming-Computer-CHALLENGER/dp/B003YVJJ5Y
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:35:32.312000+00:00) : even the graphics card?
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:09:13.482000+00:00) : wtf TI is literally pokemon go now, they have heroes floating in front of the analyst's desk
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:07:19.561000+00:00) : ign will probably give it 6/10 not enough man
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:06:40.740000+00:00) : but it is called no man
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:06:34.378000+00:00) : thats probably not man enough
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:06:24.979000+00:00) : hmm
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:06:08.089000+00:00) : so thats like pig level
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:05:42.492000+00:00) : so a dog thats slightly more intelligent than normal dogs or slightly intelligent overall
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:04:22.878000+00:00) : on a scale of no man to man how man is no man's sky
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:02:40.571000+00:00) : now i can break in and steal them
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T20:02:33.965000+00:00) : isnt that a security risk
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:56:26.369000+00:00) : yeah im at least going to wait for reviews
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:56:06.951000+00:00) : what if it doesnt live up to the hype
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:55:52.702000+00:00) : what if that games sucks
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:53:53.664000+00:00) : although it's something you have to plan months in advance, ticket sales open up in like april and sell out in like 5 minutes
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:48:24.394000+00:00) : ok
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:29:51.187000+00:00) : valve has no sponsors besides themselves and the community who buy hats
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:29:35.538000+00:00) : the community
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:27:41.179000+00:00) : and almost mechanically identical to the current dota 2
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:27:26.927000+00:00) : the originally dota mod was  very popular
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:26:18.760000+00:00) : oh it's older than that
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:20:49.426000+00:00) : sex her
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:16:40.868000+00:00) : playing
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:16:36.936000+00:00) : is that lindsey stirling
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:13:00.397000+00:00) : i like gabe's flip flops
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:12:30.948000+00:00) : a lot of people who dont know dota watch this just because its 20 million dollar prize ool
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:11:39.382000+00:00) : https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:11:31.197000+00:00) : so everything is three hours later for us
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:11:24.949000+00:00) : they are on pacific time
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:11:16.804000+00:00) : oh until late
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:10:59.901000+00:00) : TI lasts until saturday or sunday i think
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:10:16.405000+00:00) : maybe not in terms of viewership but in terms of money definitely
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:10:03.467000+00:00) : its the biggest gaming event of the year
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:09:56.648000+00:00) : sure why not
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:09:34.796000+00:00) : oh man the stage turned blue
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:08:50.754000+00:00) : but for only 8 hours more you're a lot higher level
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:08:18.721000+00:00) : if you add his time on my account thought thats probably almost 28
71716577669550080 (2016-08-08T17:07:43.389000+00:00) : so i guess the lucio ball boost and the time spent on my account balance out

71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T20:00:46.450000+00:00) : No i was just here in February but I've never seen that sculpture before
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:58:26.501000+00:00) :

71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:51:25.678000+00:00) : Or biking
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:51:20.091000+00:00) : Or hiking
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:51:10.067000+00:00) : It kind of is if you are on a road trip or a plane and can't really cool stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:50:26.416000+00:00) : Soylent doesnt require a freezer. Or even a refrigerator.
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:48:42.225000+00:00) : How would a smoothie last a week
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:43:59.753000+00:00) : But someone like you only takes like 1/6 of that serving size for a meal right
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:41:11.279000+00:00) : Literally for workiuts
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:41:05.393000+00:00) : 2600cal
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:41:01.598000+00:00) : Is it like 1 serving of that per day
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:40:18.008000+00:00) : I don't think that's what one serving means
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:39:42.069000+00:00) : 1 serving is a gallon?
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:24:08.520000+00:00) : A protein shake obviously has more protein, they are like meant for working out
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:23:15.081000+00:00) : Only in protein
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:22:37.307000+00:00) : Send me picture of label
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:21:57.317000+00:00) : Nah
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:21:29.931000+00:00) : Protein shakes are also around the same price
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:21:18.897000+00:00) : It's basically true
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:20:30.544000+00:00) : It's not because protein shakes only have Protein
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:20:00.287000+00:00) : This is like $2.40 per meal
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:19:49.602000+00:00) : I don't think so
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:19:26.288000+00:00) : Just read the reviews on Amazon they are pretty descriptive
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:17:10.726000+00:00) : I don't think it has that much sweetness, it's probably more like non honey nut Cheerios
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:16:32.422000+00:00) : The powder is less good tasting I've heard, and it's texture is more like a malt shake
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:15:28.262000+00:00) : According to amazon reviews bottled taste like the milk left over after eating Cheerios
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:12:05.407000+00:00) : That's basically me, plus its not like i really enjoy eating anyway
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:11:14.827000+00:00) : Well it was invented by grad students who didn't have the time nor money to spend on eating and preparing food
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:10:09.076000+00:00) : I mean that's what their product is
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:09:36.041000+00:00) : Yeah
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:07:37.417000+00:00) : Interesting
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:06:53.114000+00:00) : It's literally the most genius food invention since sliced bread
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:06:10.918000+00:00) : I've been wanting to try this for months
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T19:05:15.326000+00:00) : www.soylent.com
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T18:56:38.320000+00:00) : Guess what I ordered today
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T18:50:24.765000+00:00) : Keenan i think he needs his bagel. Im not a chameleon expert but that kind of behavior is indicative of needing a bagel
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T18:48:30.701000+00:00) : http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2548899546 here's the build
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T18:46:32.676000+00:00) : Ronald wings played supply morphling today and won
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T18:34:30.620000+00:00) : Lost to alliance 0-2 but beat wings 2-0 and are about to beat LGD 2-0and went 1-1 with navi
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T18:32:33.696000+00:00) : Also how is TNC beating everyone
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T18:31:54.996000+00:00) : Dota has 322k viewers
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T18:31:21.422000+00:00) : Yes I just watched ESC lose 0-2 to EG
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T18:10:46.739000+00:00) : And even if bad movies still make profit they will eventually build a bad public reputation and the franchise/ trademarks that made the bad movie popular in the first place will diminish in popular
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T18:07:39.324000+00:00) : But definitely not s much as they could
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T18:06:42.154000+00:00) : If they want more profit shouldn't they care about the quality of the production crew and not fund it until they ensure a good producer
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T18:04:04.148000+00:00) : Yes but someone has to decide if it gets funding
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T18:01:10.109000+00:00) : Then who decides who produces
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T18:00:24.451000+00:00) : How can they hire dumb producers
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T17:59:56.811000+00:00) : I don't understand why it's so hard to make a good movie
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T17:59:31.287000+00:00) : And fix it
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T17:59:19.378000+00:00) : DC should learn eventually that their movies need to stop sucking
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T17:56:20.090000+00:00) : This new Android split screen feature is really useful for watching TI and chatting you at the same time
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T17:55:25.721000+00:00) : What if it's good

71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T17:54:22.433000+00:00) : Who did you promise
71716577669550080 (2016-08-04T17:53:40.471000+00:00) : It seemed like you did in the car in the way to North Carolina

71716577669550080 (2016-08-03T01:49:15.051000+00:00) : Inside the building they were watching CNN which was talking about the FBIs investigation of Clintons emails

71716577669550080 (2016-08-01T23:07:23.280000+00:00) : You can't judge because you haven't experienced better
71716577669550080 (2016-08-01T23:04:45.505000+00:00) : Yeah shitty ones
71716577669550080 (2016-08-01T23:04:01.752000+00:00) : I also doubt pc part picker is able to properly detect parts
71716577669550080 (2016-08-01T23:02:31.895000+00:00) : That doesn't mean it's good
71716577669550080 (2016-08-01T22:58:05.443000+00:00) : Good
71716577669550080 (2016-08-01T22:57:58.702000+00:00) : Did you make sure the power supply is goof
71716577669550080 (2016-08-01T22:38:48.502000+00:00) : You need to send a new link for the build if you changed it because the old link is still the same stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-08-01T22:37:52.561000+00:00) : You have to read benchmarks for games
71716577669550080 (2016-08-01T22:37:27.480000+00:00) : How could you have the Rx 480 be in your work computer if it just came out
71716577669550080 (2016-07-31T10:12:39.241000+00:00) : Everyone knows that mccree is just a worse version if battle mercy
71716577669550080 (2016-07-31T09:41:11.044000+00:00) : Lol
71716577669550080 (2016-07-31T08:59:47.808000+00:00) : Also make sure you research that power supply and case a lot. You cmhave to make sure your power supply is good quality or if it breaks you could ruin other parts
71716577669550080 (2016-07-31T08:57:57.026000+00:00) : No you just read the specs sheet and check for antenna ports in the back
71716577669550080 (2016-07-31T08:50:25.665000+00:00) : I almost never use wifi anyway but the motherboard comes with built in wifi and Bluetooth
71716577669550080 (2016-07-31T08:37:57.262000+00:00) : My desktop using a mini ITX which is even smaller and only has one port for the graphics card and that's it
71716577669550080 (2016-07-31T08:36:07.224000+00:00) : Micro ATX is usually cheaper and if you aren't going to use the extra size for anything there's no reason to
71716577669550080 (2016-07-31T08:35:05.849000+00:00) : The second slot is farther down
71716577669550080 (2016-07-31T08:34:51.224000+00:00) : You can definitely fit one adapter in the motherboard even with the card installed
71716577669550080 (2016-07-31T08:34:32.487000+00:00) : The motherboard is micro ATX instead of normal size so there are less slots than usual and you just have to be careful
71716577669550080 (2016-07-31T08:33:59.807000+00:00) : No it will
71716577669550080 (2016-07-31T08:32:47.155000+00:00) : It does but even though that motherboard has two slots for adapters one of them may be covered up by a wide gaming card
71716577669550080 (2016-07-31T08:21:24.816000+00:00) : Also that graphics card is about 250 and the price isn't included in that list because you have to manually enter it
71716577669550080 (2016-07-31T08:20:16.276000+00:00) : You want it either built in the motherboard or connected right to it
71716577669550080 (2016-07-31T08:19:51.746000+00:00) : You have to look at that stuff, idk. But if possible i would try not to have to get an external USB wifi adapter
71716577669550080 (2016-07-31T08:18:33.607000+00:00) : Although depending on the width of your video card there might only be room for one internal adapter
71716577669550080 (2016-07-31T08:14:53.900000+00:00) : i mean that particular motherboard doesnt have them built in so you'll need internal or external adapaters if you want that stuff
71716577669550080 (2016-07-31T08:07:41.342000+00:00) : You'll need adapters or a different motherboard if you want wifi and or blutooth
