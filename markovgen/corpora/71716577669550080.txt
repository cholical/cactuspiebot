lmao
@everyone
I want to play dota
WAIT FOR ME
wtf is happening
asher speak english
you either have to lay it out for me like im 5 or im not going to understand
i dont have time for this i have an assignment due in 45 minutes
i wasnt making a joke, i just think the whole situation isnt good.
i was disgusted with his character in house of cards and dissappointed to hear that thats just him in real life too
so huge problem there
and the fact that he's also exec producer on that show
but thats the point he practically is getting paid to do it because of his role
i dont understand
what
he's literally his character
just him enjoying it i guess
all the scenes in house of cards where spacy is having sexual interactions with his young security guard isnt even him acting
<@!125452744440938497> more validation for you
http://cnn.it/2z9HqyY
remember when dinosaurs were nice
fuiytkghjk[]
this is bonkers asher
yay

you boys rweady
this fucking toad owns six (6!) sheep
we got something from every tier
the range of platformers this year is so staggering
is this bagel still good to eat?
also real question
wheres mario's twitter account
wp bubster
this was such a great tweet
https://twitter.com/BubsyThe_Bobcat/status/923308654954102784
lol
and just remembered that it existed right now
put it in the oven
i made a bagel last night
in other news
hmm thats a little late but i think i can manage that
no one is going to know what the fuck is going on
i'll have you but i want asher and ronald to experience this with me too
patch just came out
@everyone does anyone want to play this new game called dota 2?
https://youtu.be/5d1fIFZH8Nw
https://twitter.com/Doctor_Cupcakes/status/925470127621058561
when are the first pro games
one of morphlings new talents is -25 sec morph cooldown (so you can have over 100% uptime) or morph targets allies
actually wait
im not sure
also im pretty sure adaptive strike is actually 0 cooldown?
its not any more buttons if you replace your replicate illusion button with the new adaptrive strike
its just his lv 25 talent
<@127535721857679362> https://streamable.com/1i2qg
I'm going to be soon
Also I'm pretty sure Kevin spacey's character in house of cards is just the same as him in real life
The last season wasn't very good
Oh yeah for sure but I'm pretty sure the decision had already been made to end it
The last season was already nearing the end
I don't think they canceled it it's just ending
I like how the agi one doesn't have knockback
And replace it with the new adaptive strike
Well you can remove the replicate hero key binding
And almost shotgun twice in one eblafe use
That's true but you can morph faster now
Not with ults but there are a lot of heroes who's strongest spell isn't their ult
It's also an escape if your escapes are on cool down and if the enemy has one
No because you can morph just to use a certain skill they have like hex or tombstone and then return to morph instantly
and it's only a 3 second cooldown
also: only the strength adaptive strike has knockback now
it doesnt cost mana and the max rate of change went from 16 to 25 per second
also do you realize how strong attribute shift is now
and you can even more effectively use the enemy carry's power against them now
thats a 10 second downtime
you can be an enemy hero for 30 secodns every 40 seconds
yeah but ronald
since he wasnt being played
im pretty sure icefrog's intention was to buff him
ronald you havent even played him yet
it will take a while before we truly realize everything
big update
but that video seems just a \*bit\* op
just summon a ton of ships instead of one
i think it's a bug though or needs fixing before wednesday
kunkka's level 25 boat fleet
https://clips.twitch.tv/EagerFunKittenKeepo
That is true and I'm very pumped
but ronald free mango
not that they are bad just not as exciting for me personally
yeah honestly the new heroes are the least interesting part of this update
"Added support for inverse kinematics to Dota 2, beginning with Broodmother.
Check out this video showcasing her body and legs aligning to the cliff faces, stairways, and other inclined surfaces she travels across."
this is cool http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/videos/duelingfates/broodmother.webm
at the same time
lol you might be doing both
so its just like it was back when 700 started and every hero was a new experience
i love how they changed all the talents
i love change like that it makes the game new again
hes going to quit dota for real this time
all of his heroes were completely changed
ronald is going to lose it
????????????????????????//////
every year dota is just a brand new game again
it's a brand new game again
gg
All hero Talent Trees have been redesigned.
Many new ability-specific talents have been added.
!!1
Added a new option to require stop to interrupt your channeling abilities
NO RANDOMING ISNT REALLY RANDOM ANYMORE
FREE MANGO
Each day 10 heroes are selected automatically as bonus heroes for the day.
Bonus heroes provide you with a free mango on selection (cannot be sold).
YAY

<@!155893986605793281>
omg
and turbo mode!
for arnked
yo there's seasons now
SHIt
it's definitely been the longest ever no-patch period
well it would make sense i guess considering how long we've been without a patch
woah he's completely reworked
instead of something armadillo or whatever
pangolier
im so glad they changed the name of the pangolin
thats better
lol thats awesome
whatwhat
those are my favorite features
any cool quality of life stuff?
it's not bigger than 7.00 update right?
the thought of reading these is overwhelming me
no
thanks for condensing
i need to read these notes but dont have time
hey
http://www.dota2.com/duelingfates
@everyone RED ALERT
what is that
how are you going to be big dong?
you arent allowed to change your profile picture
yo wtf
therse also a new spider man trailer
yeah can people just stop making games for a bit
who knows how many of those will come to other platforms
the gardens between, guacamelee 2, oure, spelunky 2
i need to buy one soon
this playstation conference has some indie games i want
I just did the shortcut pro way
Nvm I found a much easier way to get there...

I think so, thata a good selection of games too especially for your brother
he might be trapped in there
asher you need to lay off the doki doki
It's going to be at least 2 more years I'm sure
Literally nothing useful

anyone going to watch this with me at 8 am

just keep remember the golf
you should really get golf story
hey asher
https://twitter.com/PG_kamiya/status/922136954451488768
the aftermath of the ending wasnt the best, and i think there a couple other areas where it's obvious they ran out of time but overall 9/10 game
and also the last level was a direct rip off of bowser's castle but i loved it anyway
the hat in time ending was very japanese
Same.

And top 40 in the US
Jump up super star is #1 on the iTunes charts in Japan
i probably will try to mod my black joycons
https://twitter.com/epicpaldesigns/status/921564647001649153 <@155893986605793281>
...
🙃
The devs really like birds
Birds
Also bird
I think that statement is the motto of this game
This game is very blatant about it's inspirations
I got too the wind waker level in hat in time
Is this game like frog fractions but with anime girls
Ah
Who is that


classic graders

Hey Keenan
Smt 5 news coming Monday morning
ronalds playing dota without us
You'll get him
So valve simply said the date instead of their usual vague "soon" so people would calm down
Yeah but the context is that we've been in the longest period without a patch in dota history and everyone was losing their shit and the community was degrading to shit posts about the patch coming
...lol
Lmao this is the most nonchalant thing ever https://twitter.com/DOTA2/status/921135846316695552
This will be me after mario makes me drop out of school
https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/19/16504462/white-house-fence-jumper-2017-pikachu
Only if you make a mii of him
Ikr!
?
It is done.

😢
holy shit keenan my discord icon is an actual switch icon now
i am busy
so if megan ever gets one you can move just her profile over
you can move a user profile to another switch
also
like twitch
like you can clip after the fact
we can make video clips
now
.
s

e

y

they added video recording and save transfer
<@!155893986605793281> GUES WHAT
<@!155893986605793281> KEENAWNdsf
KAZOO
ITS THE BAJO
it's too much
ahve you done this spooky manor level
the train was way better but the first city wasnt bad
like parkour
i really liked the music of the first level and how fast it was
at first i thought his city was cool but then when i got to the parade i hated it
i do like the penguin as a character though
yea
and their knockback is insane
its badly coded sometimes and invincibility frames dont always work on it
anytime theres the parade i get triggered
i hate that fucking parade
ok i did it
he can be damaged very often for a boss
i think the trick is to save heart containers and also to damage him after every move
no checkpoint
19 phases
it's some kingdom hearts level shit
wtf is this boss
the final level is the same as the time rift one
its cool
yeah
i should have just kept playing longer than 2 seconds
oh lol
do you know where the world 2 boss is?
fuck
im wondering if it's a secret
the world didnt have a boss
fuck off
and I think I did everything
i didnt see any boss
<@!125452744440938497> what was the hard boss of world 2 you were talking about?
but it's very good
😦
because i still think it's my favorite game this year
shadows of valentia
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/777p7u/summoning_the_frog/
keenan when are you going to play fe
no
Now I see it's a perspective thing and the camera is behind his head
I know but when I first thought that I dismissed it because he was way too big proportional to her
I thought he was hiding in his coat at first but then couldn't figure out why she was so big
Oh I see the camera is right behind his head
What's he hiding in
I don't get it
528
Yeah he probably won't be home from CrossFit until like 9 anyway
He isn't even home so should be fine
Yeah let me make sure nikhil is ok with it
Okie
Clara and i are just going to study tomorrow
Yeah I will be at my apartment so we can actually play cup
https://twitter.com/congressedits/status/920396207045971968
It's probably an intern
This is a good bot
https://twitter.com/congressedits/status/920379658931245056
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0XEzxULCDg <@!155893986605793281>
well we would have an hour
asher?
how is clara getting there
i really do want to beat it sometime though
lol
unless you need me to go home
i will be in psych building pretty much all day
nope
im pretty sure we were going to be working on data mining homework at 7 or 8 anyway
ok
when
play stardew\
ends at 2 or sometimes sooner
it starts at 1
if my meeting ends early
looks agonizing to play that way
idk how he is playing with a keyboard
everyone but the professor can just watch him play cuphead
he's not even in the back of the class
some dude is just playing cuphead on his laptop in my databases class
https://youtu.be/p1pLLK3TBWI
tf2 got a big update
http://www.teamfortress.com/jungleinferno/#
thank you for this btw

OK
no problem yo
i sent you the info
yes
so it's going to be a fun ride
and then the next day i have a big exam
and then keenan and i are seeing pokemon
because i have classes monday
especially because this time i'll have to leave sunday evening probably instead of monday morning
if possible i dont want to do another all nighter
depending on how good of an idea we have, thats what will determine how much effort i will put into it probably
it was just one day but i have fridays off anyway so it doesnt matter
had that already
no
and we probably cant plan the weekend before either since you'll be gone too right?
since we wont have the same planning time we did last year the night before
also i sort of dont know how serious i want to be with development this time
2 right?
do you know when it starts?
i could arrive either friday evening or saturday morning, but on saturday i wouldnt get in until noon without any delays
yeah
we had a discussion and everyone agreed not to use that channel
sup
we've been doing it all these years no problems
you obviously arent hardcore enough to manage a single channel
with his maple syrup
asher just did
you and asher talk about work all the time
but they dont have normal computer science, which in my view is broader and more theoretical
yeah
i view those as different too
and their computer sicence option is called computer engineering
just cognitive psychology
my other problem with workday is that they dont have cognitive science as a major option
im not sure how early i applied to facebook
like a few days after their application opened
yeah but i did appply to google fairly early
i think all the big companies take a while
no
i guess it should be fairly easy to apply for multiple roles within adobe
because they all have their own specific workday portal
i hate how all these companies use workday for applications but theres no way to save applications across companies
i can do it right now
why?
i also dont mind too much because its just for internships.
if i was applying for actual jobs i would try harder to get into the bigger companies
no
probably like end of sept/begining of october
we just have the catch-all recruiters
IU isn't on the specific recruiter list 😦
how did you have three of them
did you email research triangle area specific recruiters
i thought you also got a referrel
who did you harass
of microsoft referrals
and then we can have a giant chain
so by the time im a senior you can give me a referral
actually you need to try really hard to get into microsoft
i still havent heard back from microsoft yet
can you negotiate something higher
i see
where are you traveling on that friday before hacknc?
thats cool
oh right you told me about that
whats your top offer
how long do you have to decide?
but does it have an effect outside that company
you cant go back on an offer right
5k sining means just upfront for accepting the offer?
well if you end up working at fidelity tell them their website sucks for me
yeah just say you have competing offers
and their color choices suck
and they dont have a favicon
also their video thumbnails are really low res
your test results?
what does amazon need to follow through on
why?
their website really dissuades me from applying there
actually i think i looked at their website and wasnt impressed
also where are they based
should i apply to fidelity
what is it?
yeah thats what i was planning
asdfklasjdflkj
<@!155893986605793281> you should see edmund micmillen's inktober
but you did
hey you could make that
I don't know how they made such a perfect non-nintendo nintendo game
this game is perfect
it's taking htem a while to schedule the phone interview, i filled out the survey they wanted last thursday
well see though
and i could be placed with a porject that most mathces my interests
yeah they told me there will be like 3-4 person teams doing different projects
there might be subdivisions
i think their intern program is just one area
i gave myself a 5/5 on javascript, so i'll probably get a bunch of hard js questions that i dont know
and said they would schedule an interview designed around what i said afterwards
they just made me rank my proficiency at a lot of programming languages
not yet
they havent scheduled it yet though
i did i have a phone interview with them
my main complaint with this game is that i think there's too much voice acting
this is just the gateway to my super mario odyssey photo mode addiction
i spend at least 30% of my time in the photo mode
hat kid is too pure for that
yay
i hope i get to watch this movie all the penguins and owls are making
like i thought it was akin to slime-san
i thought it was much smaller of a game than it is
thats so weird
but i guess it makes since the physical is more because it's an indie game
oh thats a weird price
isnt it like a 15 dollar game
wait really?
hopefully ill still be playing by then
like true pals
so we can play it together
i want to play it at the same time as you
hm this influences my decision to play it
asher are you actually playing hat or do you just have it open
im going to agree with asher here and also prescribe a dose of git gud
moves wont 1 hit ko if you tough enough
you probably just haev to grind
I own it and have it in my playlist I just don't listen to it when I play because I don't need to hear it that many times
We'll see.
If this game actually has a good sountrack I don't even know what I'll do.
They will have broken Mac.
The game probably has like one song
https://twitter.com/ArenaofValor/status/920048639598301186
What the actual fuck.
you better have sound
at work?
i want to get a consistent group of line-standers going
neither will i, but i just have no time to go later and its a fun time hanging out with our other bloomington nintendo fans
unless you want to be first in bloomington to get it
the midnight release will only take like 15 minutes
oh also keenan
lol
remember i got two copies from bestbuy
we should go to it
then yes
oh
its only a 10 minute demo
i only wanted to watch you play it :(((
but im also okay if not
it could be a fun little adventure
i forwrad you info
what
now i can be a pro streamer
guys i got a webcam
I think there are about 8-10 hour glasses in the first world and i have 8 of them
ive almost 100% the first world and haven't moved on yet
from the longest dead period in dota 2 history
do you think we'll be saved
do you think dota patch today
https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/919897827937083392/pu/vid/644x360/cBPz7Y6R2yLISiwE.mp4 <@155893986605793281>
mario cant beat this cute kid

ronald was playing last night though maybe he'll play
i cant
https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/13/16469718/super-mario-odyssey-speedrun-demo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljf3tZGxaJM

its really hard to make a true classic hence why there are only 12 in existence
yes all of which are real true classics
it can be a classic it just cant be a true classic
is it a remake or a sequel of the old one
ah yes the sci fi movie thats apparently a true classic but ive never heard of until this year
?
m
w
LEGO BATMAN?
WHICH MOVIE
Or you can bring a DSLR with a zoom lens and then Photoshop his face onto the one with Chip
Well you should sit in the front row and then take a selfie so it looks like he's posing with you
Are you going to get *the photo* part 2
this is the best trailer nintendo's ever released
<@!155893986605793281> https://youtu.be/g4xW9aCg2zY
they leave no feedback whatsoever and i dont know how to ask for feedback because they don't even say which of the 10 of them graded it
god my ui's are so shitty
and then im never going to check it again
i just sent requests to a bunch of people
yeah i remember some career advisor telling me about that
this is so stressful
including people like academic advisors and stuff
in a professional or academic setting
should i be connecting with anyone i've met
thats a good connection i have there
did you know Ian Vasily is the founder of the Vassar Anime Club
yo
ronald what do i put on my linkedin
oh i see
"with or without"
what the hell does this mean
that looks like the same tree sprite as FE gaiden
now you can be a real speedrunner
dope
which btw im putting dr mario on mine asap
the only lag they found was audio delay by a few milliseconds
digital foundry tested it
there's not you are just used to the crt now
but that background is cool
wow their box art doesnt even fill up the full square
it was just a prank pls forgive
sorry
lmao
did i make you cancel a search
that was just a prank
jk i cant actually play
it would be even more tragic if somehow i started playing too
a tragic story indeed
😦
<@!155893986605793281> wow keenan you'll play dota with me but not the rest of the gang
yeah they deserve it
https://clips.twitch.tv/ProtectiveLightCougarYouWHY
you should really listen to their podcast, they're responsible for the writing  and localization of a lot of your favorite games
Yeah 8-4 localized it, the same company that did nier
I'm so glad undertale was brought to Japan https://youtu.be/F-0bnFYEtiY
hollow knight had this problem too and it wasnt until several weeks after release that people started to figure out it was a good game
only like 5 review outlets have reviewed the game and they arent even major ones
ive been following the development for a long time and im a little dissappointed with the dev's marketing
especially because i need to finish it before mario comes out
which is agood length
i heard the game only takes 16 hours or so to 100%
yeah i really liek the mafia
it's very good and the soundtrack is very clearly inspired by galaxy which i love
yeah
their official statement is "fall" but i wouldnt count on it because like i said it's a kickstarted project that decided to port to consoles at the last minute
i think ps4 and xbox by the end of the year is likely and switch will be later because they only recently got dev kits
it started as a pc exclusive and it was a kickstarted game so it might still be a while
not yet
windwaker + mario sunshine + paper mario
yeah it's great
gamerzrule
fuck yours4elf cuntnugget
yes i do asshole
oh sorry i forgot that im disturbable now
for september
knack 2 isnt even in the top 20 physical best sellers for ps4
:\
i dont care
that you are currently disturbing
the one with the red dot
ok
It's ok if I wait a few days before clicking start right?
i have midterms next week

it also sayhs they prepared questions based on my interests
i probably wont start it until later this week
ya
ronald prep me for the twitter coding interview
jk i havent even downloaded it yet
Yes
Yeah I was going to play it tonight too
ITS PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU SKIPPED THE SECRETS
i know this will revolutionize gaming forever
hey yall we have vidya chat now

<@155893986605793281> more hype https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bucxOT8zudk
ye
l
plus i thoought i would have a lot more time and interest to devote to getting good at tetris than i did
in hindsight its like my only switch purchase that i regret but i couldnt pass up the free keychains
or less
that game will probably go on sale for like 20 at some point
okeey
it's a little title by sega
dude theres a game for that
just the american rebranding is very strange
well it's not weird in japanese
its literally a block swaping game like dr.
mario or puyo that takes place in the mario universe but is called tetris attack
lol "Despite using the Tetris name, this game has no resemblance to its Russian namesake.
This has led Henk Rogers of The Tetris Company to say that he regrets granting permission to Nintendo to use the name."
thats the exact game but it's the first game in the puzzle leage series
yeah
i would be excited about fire emblem but it kind of needs english
you dont need language to play puzzles
sweet we can play puzzle league
what are you going to do with it?
i really want one but i wouldnt really play it or sell it
oh theres an english mode
good luck
idk how to use this site
in stock quick

just buy the odyssey bundle which is still available for some reason
if you really want to spend 420
or you know
even the neons
yoiu should tell everyone who tries to buy it that you can just go buy one on amazon right now for 300
also this confirms that it's basically pokemon eclipse
pokemon becomes interstellar
like wtf
what is this trailer's soundtrack
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLPHod1FzSk
im so mad i canceled the preorder i didnt even have
rip forest maze guy
yo wtf keanan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6ihU9wgMy4
hey akean
lol
now that i think of it this is my most hyped movie besides incredibles 2
we are going to be in a theatre with a bunch of other grown white men crying
pro

they are farther away from the screen
should we get love seats
yeah
if you can do that i'll just preorder tickets now

No
Want to go to Indy
Keean
I hate how much I'm in love with pat
https://youtu.be/RLbiemUjFTU
Which is dope
Well this sounds like an RPG theme in Dr.
Mario
Tnhas the strangest sound track
Dude it's like paper Mario color splash
Ok fine their game have but where's my ui music
No miiverse no switch menu or eShop music no cute built in apps like streetpass
I'm worried nintendo ud going to lose it quirkiness
No it's sad and should be treated as such.
Who cares what nintendo appreciates
Everybody's messaging channel that no one will have anymore
And the channel name "Everybody's messaging channel" is sad too
YeH
What pbrasing
This is depressing

I technically have this thing called "work"
When do you want to go play Mario
Keenan speaking of Applebee's
Everything is a ditto Ronald
I think this song has the best lyrics ever created

Like a blood orange
Or maybe more orangered
It's red
A hat in time.
It's like yooka laylee but good


Fuck I want to make a quadcopter
It's unbelievable right now that you can just go on Amazon and get any variant of the Nintendo switch, even the Mario one
i didnt know it had all these features specific to textbook viewing
i never used it because i always thought it wasnt lightweight enouogh and just used a basic pdf viewing application
adobe acrobat pro just revolutionized how i view textbook pdfs
holy fuck
it's cheaper on amazon anyway
nah i wont buy it
aslkdfj
2ft
fuck
how long is the cable
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
to compare with?
you dont have a normal classic there?
hmm
apparently the original classic controller has a better dpad
lol dont get the power a one
whats the price
are they priced the same?
but i think they do the same thing
not a classic controller
oh thats a wii pro controller
pic?
they make black ones?
it's ruining my reddit experience
look at the stardew spam
dont feed them
yeah keenan dont get stardew right now

i hate nintendo switch reddit sometimes
yeah hurry i dont have a lot of time but we'll just play pubg while we wait
@everyone dota 2 right here right now
This is messed up https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/73ko9b/_/
👍
Claim now
@everyone the original fallout is free on steam for another 3 hours
and if you want the mp3s i can give them to you
i just want to let you know that the cuphead ost is perfect
hey everyone
im too busy this weekend, but maybe sunday night
no i cant

This is hilarious https://twitter.com/ElderScrolls/status/913776635374997506
Nintendont give up on consoles
Naive keenan
I think on a scale of 0 to 5 if dumbness you are about -infinity
Yeah and you also cheat
I'm a portable dude
It's going to take a while before I even have more switch games than 3ds
That's dumb
Ah
Is it a nintendo select
Lol
TOO BAD SOMEONE SCRATCHED THE SCRATCH RESISTANT LAYER
May he rip
I miss Luigi already
Especially modern gen discs which are way more durable than Wii or before
I don't understand how discs get scratched
What's wrong with it
Can you get it to work?
Oh I see but you don't even have to give the game back
What he thinks eBay is going to do
That guys sounds dumb
yet somehow it's open right now
i closed it this morning so i wouldnt be distracted
goddamnit i just realized i dont know why discord is even open on my laptop right now
?
whats wrong with it
the guy who sold you the ps4?
yea
i know
yeah the full bestbuy press release was in awario64 tweet
ok thanks
Not that I know of
No
Ticketing for best buy starts at 7
Oh boy oh boy I almost forgot there is a rockstar direct today

can i see
now if you see a white ps4 let me know
eh i could probably get a new slim + a game for 200 on black friday
no you can buy them new on amazon for 35
because a used controller is not worth 50
send me the listing
doesnt sound like a good deal
i dont need an extra controller
a new one?
i need to go to bed
you stressed little mac out too much
shh
😓
😫 😖
gummy bears!
OMG>!!>!?!??!?!?!
we will see
MHMM
80 dollars, 2 controllers, appeals to people much older than us as well, all star catalog
MHMM
my only self defense is my amiibo
im going to get mugged outside of target at 5 am and it's going to be your fault
you guys are lame.
at the end of this im going to have an snes classic and all you guys will have is a hangover
every gamer in bloomington has the same backup
its going to be everyone's backup as well
thats our backup which according to you we wont need
you're too confident
or is that a dick move
he can come later right and we can just save him a spot
<@!125452744440938497>
I would like to request asher's thoughts
k fine
condition yourself
but id be more comfortable getting there by 6:30 not leaving at 6:30
that slash needs a larger slope
:/
well we can go there first and if you're wrong then go to bestbuy
i think it will be best to check target at 6:15 and if line is more than 30 people, then go to best buy which doesnt open until 10.
and if you guys want to go later thats fine with me i'll bike to ensure i get there by 6:30
keenan seems to think it wont be an issue to find one and that we can just arrive 1.5 hrs before target opens at 8 to get one there
im fine with getting wherever at 6-6:30
poor leonard
ugh
how does this xbox guy have 1887 friends while he has a confederate flag as a his profile photo in bloomington
Why are stereotypes always so true
Man
how do i claim that without having a ps4
yo mgsV is free on ps+
dota is kind of expensive with all those heroes you have to pay for
yeah i totally understand
^
did you see that movie
yeah
good movie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWBDZo3axYg
Best tweet
https://twitter.com/StephenAtHome/status/912857082940084224
Whoever that is
He was also Dean Domino in fallout nee vegas
Yeah rubick has some awesome voice likes but still
It's so sad people are playing his heroes' death lines on r/dota2
Yeah the purpose of games is to play
Neat
He also voiced Fatman from mgs2
The guy who voiced rubick, phantom lancer, and chaos knight died today
Can't blame them, that was before games a lot of emphasis on text
Wasnt
Oh right duh
I thought most nintendo characters had English names even in Japanese
What's he called in Japanese
Yeah
Well it's certainly not because nintendo head of sales and marketing is called that
Bowser rn
I love Patrick Gill

they want us to calculate the derivatives of polynomials with sql tables
yeah
lol
EXCLUSIVELY FOR UNIX OPERATING SYSTEMS
Skyrim: SQL EDITION
hush i need to beat skyrim
how do you know they just didnt stealthily change it to not tell people about it for switch
they'll fix it
hurry before the patch
thats dumb
^
i'll take that bet
no one would ever use sql for this shit
<@!127535721857679362> ronald they are making me do derivatives with SQL lol
i would rather paly skyrim than this right now
oh this sub problem has 3 sub sub sub problems
it has three parts and each part has 3-4 sub problems and each sub problem has 8-10 sub sub problems
that was just poor planning
FML
THIS ASSIGNMENT IS 6 PAGES LONG
getting all the chaos emeralds is probably easier
cant you do both
im think
just imagining that in a movie or game cutscene with this music would be hilarious
parting and meeting right next to each other
wow what a rare occurance
(
😢
no if you talk about it i will only get more sad
:((((((((((((
I have two major assignments due on thursday so im not playing golf story until friday morning in line
and also maybe for the high res art when you beat a puzzle but it will probably still be pixel art
nobody because it's never happened before
i think the only reason you should get a switch version of picross is the co-op local multiplayer and the tv play but who plays picross on their tvs
(i personally think picross is better suited for 3ds though)
its only 7
are you getting picross on thursday?
they should just have a checkers mode in chess
everyone knows chess
just wait until monopoly comes out
dont you see it's genius
the person sitting next to you
you can also do that on airplanes
but still
you can do blitz
since i dont have an ipad
but switch screen is big enough to be actual tabletop
fine they are ok
and phone chess games are dumb
but its not portable
i'll get and play with you online if you teach me how to play
beacuse it's the best chess game
I forgot it was coming out this year but it's proabbly the game you should be the most hyped for keenan
it also has fully cross platform online multiplayer
the switch perfect for games like this
this is amazing
<@155893986605793281> https://ripstone.com/news/chess-ultra-switch-multiplayer/
<@155893986605793281> that's a real ugly dsi
😿
Maybe tomorrow night between like 9 and 11
I slep

https://twitter.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/912367473944489984
our target will have 47
if you say you are coming later
i'll be in line by 6:30
well if you dont i will

because you dont really want/need one and i technically already have a european one preordered
the real person that needs to be guaranteed one is asher
but i trust no one
nintendo says they are increasing supply, the stores say they are ordering a lot, and everyone is saying the same thing
i dont trust anything
i can get 4 hours of switch battery life easy
i know thats why im fine with 6
but no one cares about them
and gamestop
you just have a to be a gamer
you dont even have to be a nintendo gamer
still there are a lot of gamers
even non gamers/collectors see this and know abouot how rare in indemand the nes classic was so they will want one
how so
if you prefer 8 we cant even check target we would have to go straight to bestbuy
im ready to do 6
oh good
you could also enter through the mall right
arent there two entrances to target though
we can but that means we have to shift everything down by two hours since it opens first
so the only thing that matters is how early you want to get
yeah we all have stuff at 11 but bestbuy opens at 10 and it will only take like 20 minutes once it opens
oh then you're fine
the latest new indie games
everything
but that may not be necessary to be that early i just want to do it just in case and because i have switch/3ds games to be playing then
<@!125452744440938497> when do you have to be in indy on friday?
I was thinking 3-4 hours before opening o feither bestbuy or target
we can have al ittle call
we can plan tonight
they would have nanounced it by now
not that i know of
no
<@!125452744440938497> are you coming to snes launch friday morning?
Thanks Asher
Some cool stuff here

Part of the problem is that people are willing to buy Nintendo games several times
Yeah
They've always had the best for handhelds but they've had no competition
They have like 20 AAA games coming out so I'm cutting them some slack for now
We'll get there
Slowly
Yeah thats the price for only focusing on games and not user experience
It's the catalog that matters
That's why it's taking so long
I think one of the reasons VC hasn't come out yet is because they are overhauling it
When you get it for one
You can get it for both systems
You can use mine
Ooh
When can't you play

i would have anhour ago but now i need to slewep
NO GODDAMN PHONES IN THE MOVIE THEATER

when can we do the exchange
true
but still you basically get to craft your sentences phrase by phrase like apuzzle
with making deductions
that game solves a lot of the problems ace attorney has
did you know the snipperclips people also made detective grimoire?
well you dont even have to be exclusive
i think the only thing you need to do to become an honorary nintendo game is  have a series release exlusively for nintendo consoles for several years
sakuri is buds with a lot of big dudes
suda51 wont stop talkinga bout how he wants travis touchdown in smash
i remember him talking about how it was so cool to him in some interview
not just her but also snake and stuff
"honorary" nintendo games
except minecraft lol
these are all basically nintendo games

i still remember specific parts like the fetus and the part where you play as the girl
i really appreciate it on a technical level
i think it was goty because it had a big open world and boobs
lol
not even wario64
trust no one
https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/910663642659545089
did you find the boobs yet
are their offices colored green and yellow
do you like it
unless it's really bad for some reason but i doubt it
i will get it to work on steam because im not playing it on ps4
ive never launched it yet
Don't worry I'll be ready in time
no it's for asher
i wonder if they just dont use that footage
some people have to object
thats true but still
why are they so stupid
how are people okay with this
really this all comes down to one queestion
"mark seemed pretty qualified"
"so you know lots of moves..."
lol that guy going on the date is so nice
i dont understand how people can be so dumb
my favorite thing about mario is that he is a middle aged man who runs around with his arms out like a plane

we all know the real reason here
i mean come on

if it werent for fucking mario you'd still have a job
you just blame nintendo
hard stuff
and that mario kart doesnt run on the ps4
lol what if ron tries to hire me
i did no such thing
no i didnt
and then quit
and make sure to call him bro
tell him that afterwards
its just a prank
lol so it's a little "practical joke"
its cool because usually the losing team doesnt get any spotlight after the event but this gives them some of the recognition they deserve
9/26
as well as ingame voice chat clips
its a series by valve that gives an inside look at the teams behind the scenes, they usually mic them up and provide clips from their coaching sessions before and after the games
hype: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lJFxUUNfl8
i can only listen
<@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362> quick dota?
quick
start now
lets do the dota
we dont have to go to bestbuy i can go tomorrow but you might never get to squish a metroid again
if we'll have time to go to bestbuy before 9
wtf how come nintendo allowed square enix to make mario jump but not ubisoft
you can get me anytime
im ready now
when is that
how
:)()())
up to 280
you're giving me the remaind right
i will name him keen
i named him leonard
im going to miss him
ok
9pm
10?
9?
i'll let you pet my amiibos
so i can get metroid
can you bring me to bestbuy
thats p late for little mac
I probably wont be able to until after 8 at hte earliest
when is hang
when?
I'm surprised your professor even has enough time to reply to emails about something so basic as missing class especially if attendance doesn't count for a grade
Lmao why do you even have to email him to say you missed class
keenan this game is just like pokemon except instead of catching pokemon you are using alluring powers to make humans fight for you
octopath traveler is such a good game
homework =/= comic
hmmm
hows the comic coming along keenan
If you want it faster than 5 minutes you have to set up direct Twitter notifications
Wario64.
Heonly tweets game related stuff though
He's on there
Yeah it checks for game deals in five minute intervals
it comes with red joycons idk why it says gray but its still a new listing so its probably just a mistake
you can preorder this on bestbuy right now
https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo-switch-super-mario-odyssey-edition-red-joy-con/5919905.p?skuId=5919905
i was telling keenan the only reason id get doom on switch instead of ps4 or pc is so my brother can play it at school
lol
but the mario odyssey bundle that is really nice was announced which will be more of a stock issue
well before the holidays it should be pretty easy to just go to the store and get a normal swithc whenever
<@!125452744440938497> are you ever going to be interested in the switch, like should i tell you if bundles are in stock
disgusting attempt to make an esport by stealing dota pros
https://twitter.com/LodaBerg/status/900337141053575168
its going to fly of the shelves with the hottest new moba in the house
nows the time to invest asher
that shit is coming to the switch
hey <@!125452744440938497> asher you know that shitty phone moba they pay washed-up dota pros to play
Thanks Amazon.

^ quiz to decide if the game is for you
* Do you still feel guilty about microwaving a hamster in Maniac Mansion?
* Would you know what to say if someone suggested that you fight like a dairy farmer?
* Do you have no idea what those last two questions are about, but love stuff like Twin Peaks, the X-Files, Stranger Things, jokes, puzzles, and vacuum tubes?
next week
aw hell yeah http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/09/thimbleweed_park_gets_a_final_switch_eshop_release_date
it sounds like new guy is missing out
what video game is he buying
when was that guy ever gone
wth
hey guys guess who has returned
well multiplayer wont be in the switch version until after pc gets it
early 2018 on pc
asher's right, minecraft runs amazing on consoles considering the game it is
they'll figure it out they have more experience than you give them credit for
bluehole can design that but im mean microsoft can handle the optimixzation and tech side so it's not as horribly optimized as it is on pc
lol im just saying microsoft is capable of handling a port
it doesnt matter they know their architecture better than anyone else
its simple
bluehole does design microsoft does the tech
microsoft has nothing better to do
im sure mircrosoft will help them
its like trying to put csgo on consoles
or a port to any console
im more worried about how the pubg port to xbox is going to work
I dont think shooters like pubg would work well on console
https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/907605347522752512
keenan how many pictures of your game shelf do you need to send
Gen 4 confirmed?
sorry im busy playing microsoft word
i have a question that i was wondering about
hey keenan do you want to call when we wait for ronald

or are they not even coming
wow did you kick everyone out of your house
K that's fine
<@127535721857679362> Ronald you can count on me in like 30 min
Join
I have some questions
Hey Keenan can you call
Lol I never thought Id own an Xbox before ps4
But I'm actually scared they'll like hunt me down for theft
Nothing charged
I did
Either I was insanely fast or they just missed me
I can't either, I was checking Twitter and the few other people who got the price error had theirs cancelled
Because it integrates well with windows and everything
Yeah I mean Ive always thought the Xbox is insanely good for everything except games
And our DVD player is.old and only 480p and probably broken
Yeah
Because we don't really have a DVD or Blu-ray
But that's the only use I can think of
I'm thinking.
I think it will make a really good media center for my family
And also you might if we plan soon
We can play it together on mine
Why
Why

I feel like I stole something
Oh god
YEAH HOW THE FUCK
new record
i have 43 windows open
yeah i made minecraft 2.0
Rude
I listened to that too
They aren't known for marketing lol
It's really common for indie games to randomly release on the eShop with like 2-3 days of notice
Just September
I go through these like 4 day cycles where I forget that it exists but then when I remember i realize that it's going to be the best game this month by far
https://youtu.be/WOZ2swwwJdo this is actually going to be the exclusive to buy a switch for, i guarantee.
The wait is killing me
yes
https://clips.twitch.tv/GeniusAmorphousSashimiBigBrother
<@!127535721857679362> ronald it's been an hour and 2 minutes and you're still not here
?
its so weird
asher you should watch slack's wedding with me
@everyone ANYBODY WANT TO PLAY A COMPUTER GAME

<@!127535721857679362> HEY RONALD DO YOU KNOW WHERE RONALD IS?
😦
<@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362> where are you boys
screw privacy
yeah
im just adding all my computer applications to discord
where are they based
yeah
lol
were they at career fair or something
whyd you apply
yes
https://youtu.be/njOTfOHiT0k
https://imgur.com/V2i8uwJ
<@!125452744440938497> come
did you find the video keenan wants you to watch yet?
by looking at my current youtube sub box
ronald play a little game
<@!127535721857679362>
i can see it
ronald took a class on serious games
he said "im returning it because it's literally for babies"
but he didnt say "im returning it because i want 4k gaming"
far from it
i mean if 4k gaming is you main goal when it comes to games then yes the switch isnt for you
well true i just dont have a reason to be interested in it
like i can see someone not liking it similar to how we dont like the xbox
it's just his reasoning is bonkers
im fine with someone not liking it or whatever
botw doesnt really look like a cartoon
if he likes overwatch
clearly its not the graphics that makes a baby game
oh im sorry
yeah so
suda51 is collaborating with a bunch of different indie devs
according you ign, you play through 6 different indie game universes in travis strikes again
exactly maybe it was on purpose
maybe he was secretely recording audio of it to put on his youtube channel
well the only part that was the prank was what he would say at the counter
yea
or lost a bet
i wonder if he was doing it as a prank or something
you should have pointed to E10+ and asked if him what kind of babies he was talking about
whats the number
why doesnt gameworld call me
?
i can whenever
favorites rack icon?

i dont think its offensive or anything though
your satire project was junior year and i dont think it was that bad
.
what was the research topic
lol
..........
i need to see
<:blueboy:352580077671677952>
i avoided videos for this very reaosn
about a python in the amazon rainforest
and another time i made a game
i made a pixton comic once for my mos
in this low quality its just going to look like you making a charicature of a black person
its hard to find a good quality angle for the screen grab
next time we see ronald we need to have a viewing party while you guys give me the director's commentary
especially with this kind of content
keenan why am i your only subscriber
i remember mrs lewis asking us "what is time" and we needed to do a project
i watched all 5 minutes and 38 seconds and i dont understand the plot
can you explain the plot
philip is the only normal one in this video

keenan every new shot of you i think its me
stop him
hes yelling
i cant beleive ronald is yelling
what grade
j

jk
save me
ASDFASDFASDf
i died
help
GOTY
lol i just remembered there's ashovel knight card game again
that fight has good music
yeah thats what i meant
dummy
which is why i asked if it would look like the cutscene
i thought that might have been actual game play for the new game at first
thanks to nick robinson on twitter i realized that the game travis touchdown is playing in the no more heroes trailer is hotline miami
ah heres more about that kentucky game
http://store.steampowered.com/app/231200/Kentucky_Route_Zero/
and a game called mom hid my game
lol i just remembered there is a shovel knight card game now
thats the wird snake game right
this reminds me of katamari and that weird snake game on psn
https://pikuniku.net/
so ubisoft will probably continue it
well it has a lot of success as far as ubisoft games go
its only a 20-25 hour game
😦
the world looks fun to explore though
lol i didnt think about what would happen when the mario bros are the serious ones in town
they all come from there
it's the place where they live
you've seen all those glowing rabbits that you can shoot for rupees right?
and you can find the forest protector there, i forget exactly what it was called
its a mountain named after him that lights up at certain times with the spirit of the forest
its not a real shrine like the others
have you found the shrine to Iwata yet
he has an island named after him
tingle definitely needs more a presence in the game
hmmm
henry didnt fuck stuff up on purpose though he didnt know any better he just wanted a good little snack
a rabbid is like a rabbit with rabies
lol i think a real rabbit is more calm than a rabbid
rabbids arent dumb they just have a sole purpose to fuck everything up
because i think rabbids are way better written than minions
im excited for the games cutscenes
SUPER MARIO ODYSSEY.....
Mario dys???
i wish it was like fire emblem and had a non-casual mode where mario could actually die
i think it does but people said normal is already pretty hard
far cry 5 but instead of the villian being a trump supporter it's waluigi
tom clancy's mushroom kingdom recon
i wonder how much you could improve other ubisoft franchises by adding mario
kilton
i cant remember his name for some reason
its like the disguises from the mask salesman guy
until provoked
the correct term is passive i guess
until you attack them of course
majora's mask is also with the dlc and it makes it so every monster is friendly with you
its just part of the dlc
i dont think you need amiibos for the tingle set
did you know it's the highest rated ubisoft game since rayman legends in 2014
you need to tell me how rabbids is
the really should have done a prince sidon
everyone hates mipha
but that could also be mean
i also thought it would be funny if i gave you the mipha amiibo
but im resisting my urges
i also want the revali one
I preordered the goron amiibo
And you need to collect all 900 mini shits to get the master shit from the God himself hestu
lol that's exactly what they are
I can admit the baby guardians in shrines are pretty cute
She will just ignore sexy link and focus on the sexy guardian men
Lol
I like her sphere stroking animation
I love her but i took her ball away
Yeah but you get a separate save slot independent from your main file
You should play hard mode and kill the one on the great plateau with three hearts and shitty weapons
Shh
You're ruining it
No
Horse God just revives
I refuse to believe otherwise
It is her
No
Zelda's horse is also in central Hyrule
It lives forever
The very same horse
It is, you can get the horse armor for it
The big horse is ganon's
Because it's special
Except for Zelda's horse
I use my horses strategically as bait
He has cool music
Did you meet the horse God
Lol
Hyped status = "pending"
I'm officially hyped
Was undertale inspired by Homestuck
How
I think the game will be good
Is it good
The trailer for this game got like 50k views on the first day and I didn't understand why it was so anticipated
I'm not familiar with Homestuck.
Can you describe it

from his stream description:
it must be an act
this guy is worse than keenan
unwatchable
wtf
ew he puts the minimap on the other side
it must be his streaming persona
gotta watch this
aww shit
i thought gameworld had it
s
e
y
but they are so bad now
that was my longest running series
most of my comics were ranked
on pixton
ronald i was a famous comic writer
I SAW YOUR CONFIDENTIAL DI PHI DATA
I SAW THAT RONALD
to get keenan to make his own web comics
i revealed my dark past
i had lots of online comic friends
not in real life
he was my friend
i remember him
it will never get better than this
this is really my magnum opus https://www.pixton.com/comic/nh420iam
Capcom predated the famous dota 2 phrase by 12 years

No big deal to lose
Nah man take it easy everybody loses except 1
you can change it in discord settings
probably because you're on a mac idk
playing all by myself over here
good work everybody

HEY @everyone DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS
I hope more rosters get confirmed soon
You got to stay up late to watch his games now
Yeah
Res only affects one guy
I saw that idk how i feel
https://pastebin.com/q9DMFa7c
ok
come play
<@!127535721857679362>
I'll do it after this class
@everyone  help Keenan is stalking me
or why it has taken over the google results when they try to search for general computer science terms
and now i have this perception that the grad student generation is completey different from us and doesnt even know what minecraft is
When I glanced over and saw him browsing all these minecraft links I was like wow this guy must be really into minecraft but then he googled "minecraft" and started intensely reading the wikipedia page for it
So in my grad class today, the professor used the terms "Big knowledge" and "NoAI" to describe the class, and the person sitting next to me started googling them.
I saw him google "big knowledge" and that was fine but then he googled "NoAI" and the first 10 links were people asking how to turn off minecraft mob AI with commands.
no super hero boom zap action
i dont like this one as much

<@!127535721857679362> ronald get in here
<@155893986605793281>
rude
keenan you're one minute late
when no one calls upon them to beat the shit out of each other
they will be sad in the game when no one plays with them
but its mon
im not crazy
but yeah dont you think its sad
also the mystery dungeon is fucking beautiful
i have i played the gameboy advance one
it's literally namco + pokemon your two favorite things
but oh well
it's kind of sad actually
neither will i
i wonder if it will have multiplayer because then thats literally all the pokken we ever need to paly
also pokken demo is coming tomorrow
yeah one sec
as well as BUBBLES
new map to turf war is coming on weekend
they fixed/changed stuff and added new map to salmon run
i will play defense of the ancients with keenan but when he leaves i want to play some nintendo shit because new update
its pretty funny how snes classic preorders can single handedly crash gamestop's site for 4 hours
yeah its running IE or something

oh]
you let iu anyware control it
you dont use citrix directly
what are you doing
they tell you how on iu anyware
you just use citrix receiver its pretty simple
you can stream it over the web
i just looked
its on iu anyware
do they not give you any software
never even heard of it'
lol
for what class
so I had to either take shitty typed notes or not pay attention
it is a good class but im going to have to take handwritten notes and i wasnt prepared for that today
either
i couldnt pay attention with disocrd off
my algorithms professor is trying to teach real shit and i cant pay attention
because its probably a general intro class for non majors
no it was a school in maryland where my profess got his degree
before sergey went to stanford
in maryland
he was an AI for him and got to know him pretty well and then they took grad classes together
idk he looks like he's in his early 40s
my algorithms professor was an AI for sergey brin
my final grade in the class was 69% which was curved to a B
i also could have done better though if i devoted more time to it
also im not a math major
it was definitely the hardest class ive taken at IU but also our teacher did not explain things well and our textbook sucked
ye
ye
keenan you should drive to our gamestop real quick and see if they are taking preorders still
books
except without the one thing amazon was intially known for
they still like doing everything by phone
especially gamestop
gamestop, toysrus, walmart, all have shitty websites
i like them because their online/technology presence is the most robust out of any store besides amazon
aw
why
im more comfortable with my boy best buy
i've had my european one pre-ordered for a long time now but i'd still rather just wait in line for the american one too
but toysrus has yet to make preorders live
i think other stores are just inferior
amazon and bestbuy preorders were in stock for 20 minutes
idk whats the issue
it was like 10x easier to get a switch when pre-orders went live
aparantly you can pre-order in person at gamestop right now
yeah pre-orders are dumb
no they dont let me check out
https://www.target.com/p/nintendo-174-super-nes-classic-edition/-/A-52826093

oops
https://twitter.com/griffinmcelroy/status/900041101226242049
https://twitter.com/griffinmcelroy/status/900041101226242049
when they were on amazon and bestbuy last night they lasted 20 mintues or so
which is very strange
no but it was availabled for less than a minute
im just going to keep refreshing
i checked it literally the minute it went live so either they only had 2 units or its a glitch
of course its not ideal
thats just one class in a subject thats not even your major
have you ever had a computer science class where the exam isnt written?
it really varies by professor
<@!125452744440938497> <@155893986605793281> https://www.walmart.com/ip/Super-Nintendo-Entertainment-System-Classic-Edition/55791858 up at walmart for real
<@155893986605793281> this is a cool commercial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN8ZnDghWAY
Preorders went live for real last night at Amazon and bestbuy, but walmart and GameStop.havent yet and probably will this afternoon
https://youtu.be/roo077srwOk
when its done we can have a 5 stack though
The Thrill and his friend invited me to a party but their game isnt done yet
ok
<@!127535721857679362> <@!125452744440938497> will any of you be able to play dota soon or should i start a game
i found a cloud 9 logo
keenan play with me
says the top 6 player
thats why we have asher
im too afraid to play pubg without asher
i'll play dota
https://i.redd.it/x2rr65lhi4hz.png
no gameplay though 😦
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYwZ6GZXWhA

these are my favorite thing about overwatch by far

wtf its 2017 and those dogs look worse than nintendogs
Best eclipse photo i found

Meepo

You can make a pinhole camera you know
Move
tp
Quick come back to Bloomington so you get a higher percentage
Every class is like that here
Yeah sorry if i woke you up I couldn't fall asleep
4s can just get more now too because there is more gold and xp on the map than before
Ever since iron talon
Offlane has been a farm heavy role for a several patches now
I don't think that will really change
Or change how xp works
Or just remove the extra creep
They 100% will or they'll put the extra creep in the sidelanes instead so the trilanes go back there
I think new patch will just nerf the duo and trilanes in mid
But more clowny
Like original OG
God moon + bulba + mason is going to.be the clowniest team I've ever seen
And take their free qualifier spot to every major and minor seriously
I still think SA needs to get their shit together
It was super one sided for og though
I guess forev and dubu maybe went back to korea
We just don't know col yet
No I'm kidding i hope not
Complexity lol
Like where's Moo
We also don't know what complexity will be
Mss kind of has been underperforming recently on offlane
I think dc is weird but I guess it could work
I don't really like pajkatt as a player though
I guess we'll see, zai is good in offlane
But that was before misery became a captain
Idk I think ppds team has a captain problem
Ohaiyo and dj are good though
Two really good captains too
Two captains?
That never works out
Yeah I also think ppds team is weird
Oh huh
Wait where is fatas team
Yeah but apparently moon has been spamming 5 in his pubs
https://i.imgur.com/K6SOdcA.jpg
But who knows bulba can also be lulba half the time
Seems confirmed basically because apparently bulba confirmed it on grands stream so Grand had to delete the vods

i cant even tell the difference
😎 <:coolkid:348648590870315028>
<:coolkid:348648590870315028>
theres so many good new pics



idk its all in the billion page branding guide
without the cream and crimson
i wish i could just only use those
their secondary colors are good
https://brand.iu.edu/
but we just have to follow the official iu webmaster guidelines for that
other than getting a refreshed website
but no we havent really needed to rebrand
dont call it sice
yeah
here we go
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIfwRCFU0uc until i finish my work
lol i think thats as much as i get
its probably why he just leaves
ever wonder how ronald feels about the fact that his name is a reference to something he doesnt even know
<@!127535721857679362> <@!127535721857679362>
no
ah good
so it is a spiritual successor just not a playtonic type thing
it's an indie game but im not sure if some of the other original people from sega are working on it
it also has the same composer
i think it's a spiritual successor
theres a new game called hover revolt of gamers coming out soon
ye
when i throw my first party this is going to be the background
this is like party music
not like on a larger scale of 1-2 minutes like most games
its repetetive on small scale with the phrases and stuff
i know but that also has its downsides because i think it can get repetetive
but its still like just repeating words and stuff
in future theres a lot of english
but it took me until actually playing splatoon 1 to start liking the soundtrack
yeah the main difference is that the lyrics are in english instead of weird squid language
i didnt liek the splatoon soundtrack at first when it came out
or play the game for
it might als ojust be something i have to get used to
yea
i can credit it for that
instaed
i wil try first game
same composer though
i dont like all the lyrics
i listened to jsr future all the way through a month or so ago and didnt add any of the songs but i need to listen to it again
yes
ok can you explain to me the appeal
have you ever listened to jet set radio
nothin
akjdskaksdjf;askdjf
fine you'll be getting that first hand account of daily life
mhmm that juicy primary source material
sice
I just got the first information on one of them and it's in a language I already know and a topic I enjoy it's going to be fucking great
For classes
I'm so excited
but i had a quiz that morning that i needed to study for
he did do a discussion at hutton at like 8:30 in the morning once on a friday that i almost went too
maybe i can invite him to SOCS and he can do a discussion and i'll invite you too
i dont know why ive never had one of his classes
me too
would you like some n'ice r'ice to go with that s'ice
n'ice
ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF SICE
it still says "Associate professor in the School of Informatics and Computing" which is incorrect
hey asher tell your dad to update his twitter bio
oh im doing pretty sice
how are you doing keenan
ugh its such a disgusting name for some reason
eweweww
ew
SICE
but still
i just realized
lol
SICE sounds like some derogatory term
this is disgustign https://twitter.com/IUSICE
Im suddenly a part of "IU SICE"
also
the google app frequently tells me about weather and dota news and traffic and shit but it recently started doing packers games too since i guess football is in season
i dont know if it knows that packer obsession isnt genetic
google knows that my entire extended family is obsessed with the green bay packers so it automatically sends me updates on their games
where dash is running on  the water and aqua jets are shooting up behind him
the only redeeming part about this water level is it has a part that reminds me of my favorite scene from the incredibles
was he mad because the ps4 games werent part of the sale
sounds like <:curse:248225815005757442>
there was absolutely no indication that a specific moving block was going to squish me
goddamnit
because water is slow
wtf sonic has to breathe
doesnt that defaut the point of sonic
wtf sonic has water levels
because its an intro class
they dont know what they are talking about
so you cant trust people if they are rating for an intro class
but my class was an upper level math class
they were all rating him for like calc 1 or 2
rate my professor people are dumb, the teacher i had who had the lowest ratings turned out to be one of my favorite
what class
read that guide
ive listened to plenty of other sonic before but this is like a best-of compilation
for sonic mania
music is so good
i still think kids enjoy it just fine
mr.
skylander is dead
for them
i think they are trying to make crash more of a mascot
lol
guns?
what do you think of
when you think of activision
he's a super hero
mario isnt a human you dummy
the art style isnt because they were trying to replicate the genesis but because they were an indie team with a low budget
it really feels like it could just be a brand new indie game
lol
i just htink it can be a little confusing and some stuff should be distinguished more
the art is really really good
yeah
i think they expected sonic fans to be playing this
it will just take more experience i think
its hard to know what damages me and what doesnt
my only problem is that i think the visual language is a little inconsistent and confusing
guys i found this new platformer that really innovates on the genre
just speed based
its not precision based or combat based
its cool to play a platformer that isnt either the mario model or the mega man model
i really like it
thats like my least favorite level
solid
the level design is really good
for me it feel like every level i discover my new favorite level
how far are you in sonic manio btw
how do you beat the game
is it aslime
wtf
do you still live in a hole
did you expand your towns borders
ah
we'll never be this good
thats the sad truth
guys this is what our server could have been https://i.redd.it/y6mvh7hnppgz.jpg
also he would not like it there
i dont think thats allowed
i have to be at home to take care of my dog because no one else is home but I also have to be at my apartment to play dota
🤔
i can probably do the morning but im also not sure if i'll be home yet
they said in general sunday afternoon i just dont know the exact time yet
i also have meetings so its not only that
well no you didnt ask first
because the people i work with and hang out with dont tend to plan things out far in advance
i dont know what my schedule is yet
maybe
PogChamp
<:ferretchamp:287291389463756800>
<:ferretchamp:287291389463756800>
when did we get a ferret emote
go well
so pls
yeah i agree and will be very sad
it was just an example
also keenan you and megan isnt that big of a deal, im mainly concerned about asher right now
thats not as sad of a reason
well then you can just break up at graduation
why not just be dataing
but why though
yea
dont you think it's at least a little bit sad
idk its just sad
close enough thouhg
not hte same
but are you dating
i just miss henry now
what do you mean
even if we were only acquaintances, she still played on the minecraft server and i saw her whenever i went to your house so yeah it was still sad
when you and megan broke up last year i was pretty sad
i hate when people break up if im friends with both of them
i like asher and i like clara i want them to still be friends
go well
pls
Don't you have safari by default
Put it in a different browser

It's the most famous.dota 2 guide
But also read this guide and read it again every time you play https://purgegamers.true.io/g/dota-2-guide/
Yeah
But you may already have the required number of games or close to it from the past
And I double t pangolin will be in that
With real people
Oh they also limit your hero pool until you have a certain number of games
Hopefully pangolin won't be a mid hero
Lol
I might borrow the first one some time
Ok just making sure
You already own sacred stones though
You bought them?
I learned so much about behind the scenes stuff and it was.pretty funny
Also <@155893986605793281> should at least listen to the first 15-20 minutes because slacks talks about what it's like working at Valve
<@125452744440938497> you should really listen to this episode, it's very good https://youtu.be/VbtrrulSzrY
No I need to leave soon, I can later tonight though
We can do ez mode
Yeah maybe Ronald can actually play with us this time
and it applied multiple times
but i have no idea where thats from
it's applying some "Audible promo"
it will probably be canceled but i guess we'll see
i was able to do it twice
amazon
wtf

i think it's a glitch but i ordered and it was free for prime members

Goddamnit Asher that was the best feature
They going with Dawn and dusk colors which are my two favorite colors
New map is pretty cool
Reggie probably thinks Americans would be too confused by a physical box with only a digital download code
Yeah it's only confirmed for everywhere but the u.s.
Like shiny boxes with a download code
They are also releasing "physical" boxes for gold and silver
Gen 4 started that
Pokemon has always had lots of forms
Idk probably sun bet it's the opposite
The box art is really good
Just the legendaries

build your own marmalade
in water
and drink it raw
so you should just put a whole one in
the less you peel the orange = the better the marmalade
in the article
i mean look at the picture
we'll bing it
lets make marmalade sometime
start a new hastag
without cutting or peeling the orange
and drink it
and pour some water in
put it in a glass
you take a whole orange
we probably killed it
not quite sure

well most people have to be following each other for dms to even be allowed between them
this beautiful katamari song is just a generic anime song
i think the idea is that you would slowly get more and more personal with someone until you get to dm them

I mean check out these handsome pics https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/6tx7uw/_/dlo9a38
I love how the dota 2 reddit suddenly got a fetish for Sccc
thats totally possible just make a 6 hour game with 1 hour of each jrpg
so they are combining one 3d sonic into one
and thats what will make it goty 2017
more like they are putting as much classic sonic edginess and fan fiction as possible into one game
they need to do that with final fantasy
yeah fortunately for me they created a single game that combines the best 2d sonics into one
<@155893986605793281> mastapeece incoming

<@155893986605793281> tell Ronald don't do it
Yeah
There are orchestra seats set up in the arena today

I have a subscription to them so i saw that, but I kind of just wrote it off as a kids thing and didn't realize the Garfield factor until now
Yup
Nick is probably not a bad person, he's just irresponsible
I guess it's probably up to Griffin
I think in general he doesn't know as mucba about games
Lol maybe
But it's hard to tell
Yeah one person would probably just tell him to fuck off and he'd go to the next
I think it was persistent across many people but maybe not so much so with the same person
But that's the worst I really saw
Basically his idea of flirting is telling people to send nudes
They are on neogaf
His apology was decent but I kind of find it unbelievable that it took him until now to realize that having power means he needs to also be responsible for his actions
Well i hope he finds success independently
Link?
Lol
Where's that post
I saw his apology but didn't see that polygon fired him
I don't think you really need it
Are you here
That's the only thing left today
I kind of want to stay for all star gsme
We are in the DotA 2 building


We have to make sure Ronald is in there for a game not just the draft
<@127535721857679362> <@125452744440938497> I'm probably going to line up for tokens in about 10 minutes, so Asher you can come out and just leave Ronald in there when get them
Come to key arena Ronald
He password is narrowviolet078
NETGEAR 13 is the ssid
Also to lock the house enter the code again and spin it left
The wine was there already but Asher bought the beer
There's banana bread on the table if you want it
<@!127535721857679362> ronald after you take the train, get off at westlake station and then walk towards a store called nordstroms and there's an elevator to get to the monorail which is faster and takes you right to seattle center
no it's digital there's a code it's 1415
but i can give you very precise directions
you just might have trouble finding the house
yeah
until it was delayed
yeah thats what we were planning to do
really?
it took 23 minutes to do lyft
i think you should get here in time
the code is 1415
yeah you can
we probably wanted to leave around 10
but we can figure out for sure later
i can write a check for you probably
i dont think you need to withdraw cash
ok they just went to bed i think
brb
she also said we can just pay her 50/night
yeah we can talk about it later, i havent paid her yet either
you can figure somethign out
no you'll want to write a check to my mom's friend paula
its in a nice area
yeah i leave evreything there
the house is kind of in between a bunch of other houses but there's a roundabout you can be dropped off at and we can find you outside
we'll still be here when you get in so you can just call us or something and we can help you find it
308b Valley St.
ok when we got in we tried to take the train but it was delayed for a long time so we ended up getting a lyft and the drive in took about 23 minutes
do you need an address
what time are you getting here?
hes just eating ramen right now
it's hot but if you ever go inside key arena it can get cold
The couch turns into a bed
Yeah I'll give you the couch and there's sheets and pillow and a comforter
look at him bending down

i think i took it too early before he started smiling
Yeah

It's the draft
Phones

No the first few days have a lot of games
There's food vendors
And there's a reddit community shop
Just valve
haven't seen much yet but there's a cosplay competition so whatever day that is I think we'll see a lot
There's people from all over the world
Very diverse
Maybe for the grand finals
No he was in skit but he didn't say hi the everyone this year in his flip flops
It wasn't released for any Nintendo platform
if they are follow mega man collections 2 it will be released on every platform except the 3ds
i didnt release that was its name
oh nvm
what is that
monster hunter worlds will be their next big one
lol i dont know keenan but i think they like ports and re-releases
is it a remake or something?
i dont really konw what it is
this was just announced today http://www.capcom-unity.com/capkel/blog/2017/08/08/take-that-apollo-justice-is-coming-to-the-nintendo-3ds-eshop-this-november
is the new ace attorney a japan exclusive 3ds title?
(even though technically XX is a port too)
they have will stop releasing ports soon enough
resident evil will probaly sell well
street fighter sold well
but i think they'll get their shit together eventually
more like nothing right now to announce regarding their plans
its not
i dont think you really need to read to play monster hunter but i'd rather just wait for a u.s.
release
no
im going to try it
<@!155893986605793281> there's a monster hunter XX demo on the japanese eshop
yeah and theres no way to know that before you buy
and more item codes
for finals, you get a hat, another pin, a collectable hero figure, another plushie and dota playing cards
and it comes in a dota branded bag
for midweek, theres a pin, a water bottle, a plushie, and temporary tatoos and they come with codes for in-game items
i guess i'll see you that day lol
oh nice tell me how it is
where yare you going at 2:30
had a good mentality
they took it really well
envy and puppey did really good losers interviews
oh they do losers interviews too
filling?
it actually does come with a goodie bag
<@!127535721857679362> ronald you should try to haggle your way into a 20 dollar ticket for thursdayso you can experience it with us
yeah he can fly for two seconds
i dont think there was one nerf to aghs that did it but she kind of shifted from a 1 or 2 position hero to an offlane hero
different players do different builds, mirana is pretty versatile
nerfed too much
yeah aghs is dead
It's pretty amazing inside
they just announced a dota card game
Idk valve runs a tight shift here
You have to scan it when you leave too
They have security
Yes because you need to scan it to get in
Kind of hard to pirate
With a radio chip inside
The tickets are thick badges
But I'm sure you could get in really easy
Yeah
Not pissed because i already sold my extras
Yeah it seemed extra shady because he had a ton
I couldn't tell if it was a scam because he had a whole handful of them
There was a guy like that selling midweek tickets for 50 dollars
And watching on the grass
In the shops and autograph sessions
Also there's a ton of people outside
Sort of, the seats where you don't get a good view are mostly empty
People are really calm
Yeah we've walked casually by other personalities too
Raise the brightness, he's wearing the official ti competitor jacket

Lol
Lol
they ran two heroes they never picked before
bulba saved strats for the main stage
wow they actually did it
holy shit the team fight execution from dc is insane
wtf i dont think they played dp either
i dont even think they played that in the group stage
why did DC first pick naga
ok wtf
asher's is 6:50 and im going to try and get on that one too
got it
ok whats your address just in case
the difference between 3 and 4 hours of sleeps honestly isnt much
im probably going to half-sleep while trying to watch this game
so you can sleep there
but there is a 5 hour plane ride
i would sleep if you're driving
bulbino save me
lol im 0/5 on bracket so far
Those immediate tps to the shrine were 👌
I love watching these extreme underdog teams play who have nothing to lose
dont forget to do your fantasy draft
Look at his Navi shirt draped behind him for good luck
Timado is so charming
I think it was a safe draft based on their day four success
It gets first banned against him
Forev is really good at it
Idk they won a couple games with that exact draft basically on day 4
I think fata plays really well on death prophet as much b as I hate that hero
Like people usually do
Yeah it's really hard to fault envy
I'm happy for reso but I dont really think empire deserve him
Seems sort of unfair
I'm kind of salty that empire can win with a super good standin
Idk he tries so hard too
Empire are being carried by him
Resolution is so good
Three long fights at the c9s base and empire still don't have a rax
Empire also has no push
Damn
They can potentially still win with arc Warden split push but it's rough
Man how come c9 can't get any kills
This game is going to be really close
<:sadboy:230133848740986891>
How much you want to bet that tobi and synderen cast the grand finals
He seemed pretty successful on arc earlier
No I think you just get a ticket when you enter and you turn it back in when you leave
They have constant shuttles going back and forth between the airport
It's pretty good service too you get free water bottle
It's 8 dollars per day there instead of 9 i think
But make sure you park at Fastpark
Also Asher I think it's just easier if i ride with my mom
There are a lot of reasons why they are good
1106 is the one I'm trying to get on
Southwest
Well I fly on whatever isn't full
<@125452744440938497> <@125452744440938497> <:happyboy:230130509630406656> <@125452744440938497>
Also what is your flight number
It's like 8 dollars a night to park your car which isn't bad
<@125452744440938497> are you riding with us?
Yeah we can wait for you
Thursday
I meant to ping <@125452744440938497>
<@127535721857679362> that aui interview was very good
They start at 10:30 and there are usually only 3 best of threes per day
Or maybe even 6
Games are going to go really late today but i th every other day they won't go later than 7 or 8
Idk I'm really flexible on food
I think it would be a good idea to buy bagels or something for breakfast and eat out at dinner and sometimes lunch.
I'd imagine we will skip lunch sometimes depending on who is playing
Because honestly I don't need much to sustain myself
Also we might go shopping
People on Reddit have been recommending some stuff
Ut there's also some cheap restaurants around the area that we can check out
There's a big food court near the arena
This is kind of sad
Wow they are doing losers interviews
Yeah
Execration are losing
Uh oh
Which was weird after not talking to him for like 3 years
I just ended up seeing him a lot because he works in my building
Not really but we say hi to each other and stuff
I'm not sure exactly what he does but he helps make parts and deliver stuff for the research labs
Just last week he cleaned our labs fridge
Idk I see him occasionally
As like a machine shop intern or something
He works in the basement of my psych lab
Ronald do you remember Alex Snooks from tennis
Good I don't want to have to bear that stress by myself
Asher are you going to be done in time to watch c9 empire
You should do racquet sports or something
Lol
if you ever get a chance to take a number theory class you should because it makes you feel like a badass
although in my cryptography class i learned a bunch of really cool ways of working with large prime numbers without using calculators
in my math classes where you cant use calculators you never see numbers higher than 30 or decimals smaller than 2 digits of precision
i bet for engineering classes a good calculator is basically mandatory because they design the questions with realistic numbers
but since you're doing engineering they probably will let you
upper level math classes never let you use calculators
lol
i got (11+sqrt(7)) / 3
I woudl multiply by (sqrt(7) + 2)/(sqrt(7) +2)
8 teams play, 4 will get eliminated
All 4 bo1s
No it's right now
These lower bracket matches are going to be so hype
But idk these Chinese teams are being strong
I put VP
It's only bo1s for the first round
No
The bo3
This is the play of the tournament
https://www.dotabuff.com/clips/newbee-trades-5-for-1-3362390555-e99fc1dcaaca
Because we couldn't find available housing to cover 7 days and it would have been more expensive
Newbee.
They lost
Wow.
There were like 7 buybacks in one fight
Asher are you watching this
🇨🇳
Ugh
Goddamnit eg is throwing
"constant of proportionality"is a strange term
Yeah
And even after like 5 years since I've learned trig I still have to look up the damn circle every time
My problem whenever i take those tests is that they usually make you do basic trig
It's simple calcus
Can't you basically look up everything or do they time you
I can see why free response would be shitty
I'm pretty sure the one I took was multiple choice.
But I also think it didn't matter because of AP credit
Math is a beautiful thing
My friend.
Holy shit that whole segment was gold
JACKS CORNER
SumIl and crit took too long to buy back
Holy shit
EG :(
All these teams and their dumb blue logos
I love these TI archives
I can't wait for execration and infamous to win their games and then the panel acting like it's a huge unexpected outcome
Idk I think they all look waxed
i guess he's immortal though isnt he
but his powers are closer to ironman's
the gods are also kind of difficult
there are no other categories
we really di hack comics
shit
then why isnt he iron man
i thought he was hit by a lightning bolt
the flash = iron man
batman = ironman
basically all the iron mans are super heroes because of external events and all the wolverines were naturally born to have some power
yeah i better go call up stan lee and warn him
silver iron man = iron man
black panther = iron man
vulture = iron man
falcon = iron man
ant-man = iron man
yeah almost every marvel super hero is either an iron man rip off or a wolverine ripoff
Lol sometimes when you own too many IPs you accidentally copy yourself
Did you know the fantastic nfour is just a worse version of the Incredibles
Is that the invisible one
You offend me
Ember spirit isn't stretchy
Isn't he the stretchy one
He's basically like that one fantastic four guy
Ember spirit
Also Keenan just so you know that orange fire guy on radiant is my favorite hero
It's a lot more difficult to follow without sound so i don't blame you
Well that's what the analyst panel is for
So it's a big deal if he dies
He's trying to avoid fights until he's stronger
Yeah he's farming
Also the commentators kind of serve that purpose
Maybe they see someone else on the map
Yeah well they will retreat if I'm they think it's not a good fight
Like you can at least see who wins fights right
You can usually tell that by hp bars and stuff
Kill ancient
3 lanes
5v5
They appear in the top right and they explain items and abilities
Do you see the overlays now
https://www.reddit.com/r/dota2/comments/6s7jbi/_/
Ugh this almost a keychain
IK SO EXCITEF FOR THIS ATTENDEE PIN I DIDNT KNOW I WOULD BE GETTING
I don't like horror game
Everyone always talks about 4
Well if revelations 1 and 2 is coming to switch probably re4 will too
Sounds kind of like kingdom hearts and the Gameboy/ds games
I guess it's just a side story
Strange
The hell.
What's the difference gameplay wise
At work?
Working
Wow seriously
<@155893986605793281> pls
Hey Keenan what's the difference between the resident evil and resident evil revelations series
Ty liquid
Liquid is saving my fantasy draft
WITH LASER RED LEDS
The only thing not in real sports is the sick ASUS ROG GAMING LAPTOP
Yeah
Two of them won TI in the past
All of those are former pro players except for the host day9 who used to be a pro StarCraft player
Look at all the suits
God DotA is so professional when they want it to be
I know but that's the link to just the chat
https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti_newcomer/chat
They try to help everyone
Also twitch chat is actually helpful you can read it
And draft
It's probably more useful in the early game
It might have been happening too fast for the overlay guys to overlay
So you wont
Well the game is over now
Probably radiant will win but iG is fighting back hard
IU STOP CALLING ME I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR GAS LEAK
So you can rely on the casters even less
I think the overlays are all text anyway
You should probably watch that instead it will make things a little more clear
Also Keenan there's a newcomer stream this year which h is the exact same but with extra help boxes overlayed
Bear is feeding
Da fuck is happening
LIQUID ARE UNDOING IT
LIQUID ARW DOING IT
mhmgmgmgmgmggmm
Asher this game is way more hype than i was expecting it to be
WORSE THAN OVERWATCH
BUT NOT THE GAME AND ITS SOUNDTRACK
you
Ok i forgive
Good shit.
Oh that's smart
ITS ALWAYS THERE IN YOUR MIND
YOU CANT MUTE THE MUSIC THOUGH
sorry for caps
HM IF ONLY THE SOUNDTRACK HAD THAT COMPLEXITY
Do you ever get to sex pippa
Ou have to show me sometime
Oh boy
Not
It really saying much though
It's definitely valves nicest looking game
Yo this is dope
https://twitter.com/Cyborgmatt/status/894635440417849344
I actually really wanted them to do well this year
Rip bracket
Ye
It's like the common heroes are completely different
It's weird watching these drafts because I'm so used to watching NA games
Slacks skits are on point
https://twitter.com/TobiWanDOTA/status/894612421876211712
The player intro videos are edited like a BuzzFeed video

Now slacks is kissing the donkey
And now day 9 and double ti winner panel + merlini
And they introduced all the teams while the players awkwardly smiled and waved
And then they had some YouTube singers perform the DotA theme
Slacks and kaci and gaben did a pre-recorded skit and then they brought a real donkey on stage
Lol there's actually a different YouTube band this time
https://twitter.com/SirActionSlacks/status/894584227546648576
Hoenn https://youtu.be/utaWZT5N-tQ
excited
i need to do my dota predictions real quick
what you want to p[aly
At fastpark where we usually go to park
It's usually like 9 dollars/day
<@125452744440938497>
Also Asher do you want to drive with us to the airport on Tuesday?
Since your flight back home leaves a day later you won't have car on the way back but you can take the shuttle.
That way you don't have to pay for parking
K
<@125452744440938497> video game?
why are they wasting two whole days
my package has been sitting in Indy since 9 am on Saturday and hasnt moved
fucking fedex
Next I need to find all my ds game boxes
Finally organized my Wii collection

<:perfectangel:230127369728425984>
Please help raise awareness
It's ok to use that as long as you accompany it with a disclaimer
I hope you guys know that people mistakenly calling apes monkeys is a serious issue and that you may accidentally be helping to spread it
Lol trhey probably moved it up because game of thrones is at 9
I'd fight adamantly for tea
Holy fuck if they did that we couldn't be friends anymore
Unless it's bagels vs donuts
I hope they don't do anything related to food again
The smell of shitty food courts
I swear I could smell it every time
The ketchup v ketchup ones were better anyway so I didn't have to look at the digusting map
They were probably both against ketchup
Good work
Says the guy who didn't help
Minecraft 2 is literally what they have been doing it's just not called that
Basically ever since Microsoft bought them most of the work is done by experienced studios which raise the game to AAA
Eventually the Java edition will be discontinued I'm sure
Which is why all ports of the game use a custom engine that fixes all that
The code foundation is really bad
The Java version was created without knowledge that it would be huge and continuously updated for several years
No
And it's not because of incompetent deveopers
Well there's a reason Minecraft is the way it is
Keenan and I played through the first one a bit and it's a good game
Yeah it basically means i no longer need a ps4
k
i kind of want to play dota
planet odd lives on
resolution is going to get his revenge against c9
ok panel pls stop talking about og pls thnx
yeah my boy blitz hating on the monkey king
but theoretically the groub b teams are stronger i think
because you never know
yeah if i were an og fan i would be worried to face either infamous or empire
if anything i would be most scared of the peruvian team
secret and igv seem strong on paper but they historically havent been good in that situation
i honestly think that most of the lower bracket teams in group B can probably beat the ones in group A
OG LUL
ti4 was sad in multiple ways
im very surprised there were no tiebreakers at all
good shit
i just hope the main event one will actually do the job of a panel
the winner will be upper bracket since they are tied
yeah thats a very important game i think
ya
besides blitz
specifically pros who couldnt qualify
pros
i think groub B was the harder group
since he cant bash on his ult anymore his ult isnt even that interesting to watch
i think it's about the same either way
i think mk is trash
im not
aui could win a ti again with techies
he won ti5
idk whatelse
bane
lion
idk theres a few more than four i thought
thats what i would do
what if
i still cant decide if it's a good thing we're missing monday or not
yea
that will be hype
secret might play c9 round one lowerbracket on monday
except maybe wings last year
idk typically teams that do really well ing roups dont do well overall
because lfy was already guaranteed first
ppd tweeted that it was going to be free for og yesterday lol
thats good
they literally cant cast without mentioning "throws" or "questionable plays"
it's the same 3 talking points every time
or a weird ee decision
this cast is almost unbearable because you cant go 30 seconds without lumi mentioning a cloud 9 moment
i really hate the memes surrounding cloud 9
actually i think even then they might play tiebreakers
what happens if hellraisers 2-0 them
i knew NA would pick it eventually
that was a good game
because they would lose without him
they just want to double pipe and seige rax with dp and arc warden
they have a seiging team
i dont see a problem with that build
https://i.imgur.com/OZfoFKE.jpg
Yeah if he didn't he wouldn't be unknown now would he
Asher we can meet the man himself https://twitter.com/PLAYERUNKNOWN/status/893748400633503744
abed i think has the second highest core score from those teams
and ana has the highest core score
and forev has the highest offlane score so far
bulba and boboka have the highest support scores
pick OG, IG, or DC players because they all play two games and have a shot at playing more than that with tiebreakers
<@!125452744440938497> yo dont forget fantassy in the morning
sorry there were some bugs
ok im ready
i can in probably 30 minutes
he can probably be successful independently though
well he wont be at polygon for sure
im thinking it will all be resolved behind the scenes so people dont have to go public about it
yeah it's pretty bad when even your friends express anger about it
yeah game devs that i follow who arent even journalists are tweeting about it
lol
nick's sex life
i have nothing against whatever they might be into but that may be a hint
then i went through her feed and thought it was strange
the top comment on that video was a link to his girlfriend's twitter posting where she posted a picture of herself posing in underwear with nick in the background at his computer recording the video
remember when he did the wolfenstein is a good video game video?
true
which is pretty bad
it seems like it may have been a persistent thing
but it's unclear if it's even because he got drunk once and did it
he retweets really lewd photos of girls and cosplayers in the game community
but there are some hints in his twitter feed like i said
people probalby dont want to directly come out because then they might get attacked, like that tweet asher linked
well its alluded to in the neogaf post but not explicity described
in the games industry
it seems like he just harassed a bunch of people on twitter
i was looking forward to his mario odyssey coverage
yeah his actual thoughts on video games align almost exactly with mine
it's hilarious that this all got out because of the overcooked switch port
lol
i feel like someone died
it seemed a bit out of place
also his girlfriend that he lives with (i think?) posts borderline porn on twitter
i can definitely see this as being true, he does occasionally retweet weird stuff on twitter
More details http://m.neogaf.com/showthread.php?t=1415751

😮
just checked twitter
😦 😮 😦
im proud of my dudes at valve, finally getting their little indie game out there
valve is advertising wtf
http://www.dota2.com/play
NEW TRAILER
this ODpixel blitz cast is the greatest cast ever
lol empire rage quit
yeah igv's team is way better lategame
5 gems in oracle's stash
see this is the why you watch
i know but i like these kinds of games because eventually everyone goes crazy
rip predicitions
i will tun e in
which game
almost all the carries are getting picked
hes getting picked

every team basically beat every team below them
i dont think the groub B standings are going to change at all by the end of day 4
keenan you're abandoning team ketchup
i think the perception is that naga is one of those "safe" heroes thast very consistent
lol
ya
over 100 heroes picked
i was a little hesitant going into it since we didnt have a patch in a while but i love it
This might be my new favorite DotA video https://youtu.be/zV6RKFTa9OA
Art book is nice though
I also usually do it for the soundtrack but this one doesn't have a soundtrack only stickers
Knowing me
I probably would if I were as excited as you are
Idk, that's like a 45 dollar mask
https://www.specialreservegames.com/reserves/absolver
There's a very limited run of it by a different company
is the furry phase over yet
its still in stock in a lot of places
oh right
which one
the main downside for amazon at least for me is that it doesnt work for amiibo
for bestbuy's thing, you pay 30 dollars for two years and you can get 20% off any video game thing any time, even on top of normal sales they have
well you always get 20% for preorders and for buying the game up to two weeks after release
you have to have prime
im just saying if you want to buy new games, 48 is not that much more expensive than 40 and you dont have to wait for a used copy and you get a new game
thats more of a discount than amazon or bestbuy but if you use them you can get 20% off every new game, and bestbuy includes amiibo and accessories and stuff as well
thats not 10%
why so much off
whats the price for you used
Man these are the worst grades I've gotten in a long time
it will be at least until midnight until i can play
i dont know if i can actually play tonight, by the time this is done i'll want to go to bed
and its like 5 gb
oh wait i have to update
<@!125452744440938497>
ok lets pay
i can in a bit
i mean do you want me to send you links?
there are a lot of studies showing that living on campus is way better for academic performance and a healty livelihood
adding an extra 2 hours of travel each day (conservative) is not good for stress when you have to deal so much other academic shit
if he has at least one in-person class a day it's not a good idea
i do
it's literally dumb
its not good for academics
for a student
thats a super bad idea
1-2 days for people from out of town to come and get set up before classe start
well no thats what orientation is for
yeah i guess normally all that stuff would be done at orientation but you probably dont get one of those
compared to bloomington
IUPUI is a great campus and Indy is a fun place
you should be excited
you should take advantage of that stuff
its that time of the year again
And are way cheaper than dorms
Apartments can be student housing too
On campus housing is
Can't you just do student housing
Where's the dota
Literally grabbed it and won never dropped it
Holy shit my team just won rainmaker in 10 seconds while i just died two times and did nothing
Where's the dota
The best way to spend an evening
i completely forgot just now that they werent always c9
its weird, most of the time when a team gets sponsored i have a hard time adapting to their new name but with c9 it's completely natural
<@!125452744440938497> ok lets play a few games
i can in a bit i need to finish some stuff first
https://twitch.tv/day9tv this should have been the noob stream
ronald.
this guy thinks he can fantasy draft after not watching the dota scene for several months
lol thats what i mean, it's hard to keep track of
yeah
did you do fantasy for today?
and also if you miss one or two days you are basically out of the contest for top 10% and will only get like 8000 points at most if i remember correctly
the battle pass doesnt expire until the middle of september so you still have time to earn points trhough other methods
yeah but are you really going to keep up with it every day
i dont think it's worth bringing your windows computer just for that
i doubt ill play dota, my laptop sucks at running it
yeah i need to make fantasy predictions
ye that too
i am also lazy
and i really want to keep the zone
i have ideas for that world but most of it requires blocks outsize our zone
i know right
you should make it creative but with the same border and we can work on improving out area to make it really dense
then in 2024 you'll meet your first child, keenan jr.
nah you'll be married in 2020 and not even know until she texts you about it in 2021
if you respond this cycle, sex is inevitable.
youve been in a relationship this whole time you just dont realize it.
her relationships just progress extremely slowly.
one base every 3 years
lol
wait so you're telling me nothing even happened after/during the trip and she just rememberd you out of the blue 2 years later
was it shortly after the trip or after the last cycle when she remembered you
or has this just always been a one way thing
did you ever date her?
i forgot
sounds like a dick move either way
your dreaminess permeates through any existing relationships
keenan you're so dreamy
lol
it's a fighting game
i wont
😦
merp
do you think thats crossplay between ps4 and pc
lol
I WILL PERSIST
that time is goingt o busy for games
ok
im pretty sure thats the big new thing with superheroes 2
IDK if it has online play and if it did it wouldn't be crossplay with ps4
IDK I might get it for switch and if it has multiplayer that's local wireless instead of split screen it would be fun that way
The whole kgb thing was probably the worst thing we've ever done
Not in a bad way
For some reason these looks really silly

They just announced persona Q 2 and two persona dancing games lol
<@!127535721857679362> predictions close by morning ronald just fyi
found this if anyone wants https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k_edWIomIc6iUYrZX86aQV_6wQsRdqe-BueGI7kHCM0/htmlview?sle=true#gid=383519710
i would make predictions with you but im too tired to think about anything i just want to copy someone's
pick group a teams
oh shit
is there a google sheet somewhere i can copy
when do they close?
i cant play tonight have work to do but i need to make my predictions as well
idk if valve requires live audience
if even that
i think only the bts minor will be summit style
live audience
there will be but unless they are really enticing i doubt tier 1-2 teams will attend
There are multiple back to back million dollar tournaments
Previously most just had 100k
Sp much prize money throughout the year
<@125452744440938497> <@127535721857679362> this is fucking crazy https://twitter.com/Cyborgmatt/status/892437884120293377
first person is harder
can you hear me?
Yeah sure
30
no
it's just like the hunger games in minecraft we used to play ronald
and i literally just started sat.
keenan doesnt play it
Sorry i just got in bed and need to wake up early tomorrow
rubick and pudge
But predictions are due by Tuesday night i think
You still have plenty of time time
<@125452744440938497> <@127535721857679362> don't forget to vote https://twitter.com/DOTA2/status/891828408648216578
K
Tell Megan to start
No one is even joining our game :(
I don't know if I can do this anymore
I fell off the edge twice
It's actually just a 30 year old and this is his secret tactic
Don't want to kill them
I feel happy
Someone is named that
Splatoon game
Family :)
It still up to Asher
Not all night
Asher I can do whatever
Tell Megan to start a game I need to fix my controls
Fatigue setting in
This is like my 9th hour of Splatoon today
Tell Megan I am starting
Yeah Ronald I got to play asTthe Kingsman
Holy shit the pro controller is like.
Pillow
Y
A
K
O
D
Y
A
K
Oo
You'll see
The Kingsman
I got to play as Kingsman in the single player
One sec
You ruin my winrate?
U drink
I worry
I.thought Asher was there
Are you even home
My hands are still tired but I can hook up my pro
Do you want to voice chat?
You're right only octolings are
Pearl looks a lot better with long hair
https://i.redd.it/4lri5xfrwicz.jpg
It's only because my pro controller is hooked up to my computer and i don't want to disconnect it
I should probably start using the pro controller instead of the grips
She beat me though
I have to stop playing.
My hands are hurting
All the p i need
Just enemies die in my in so it gets me p
I actually never shoot the ground
All my p comes from kills
She's good at getting p but not kills and I'm good at getting kills but not p
Fine we lost a couple of really close games together but we just won again
Rip
Tell her to spam
K I'll start a match
i did so well but im playing too much duck hunt and not enoug mario paint
what a game
lol
i got so many kills though
theres a fly in my room and its really distracting me
she can join my next game if she wants
but afterwards we can play duck hunt together
ok i accidentally started
sad
i did so well i cant believe we lost
its because we got team wiped at the end
its cuz they had the reaper
my n-zap 85 is mcree
lv 10 is ranked
join
k
i cant chat because pubg download is taking all my internet
join
are you ready ?
im going to start the search
they can be 1 minute if your bad
isuck
5-6
5-=6
after
just started a rnaked match but i will
its ok i have to start reading the rules for ranked splatoon

Ok Asher I'll get the game to play with you but that seems like a shit gift so I'll be keeping you in mind next time I see something you might like
They would actually be more likely to participate than me
lol
mic isnt working
adsfadf
Yes
I'm importing the joycons from play Asia as soon as they come back in stock
I think it's weird too but technically that pink color is the primary color of the game
Neon pink and green
It's pink
that's good
I guess people might not take off for their birthday weekends now that i think of it
Did you have the day off work?
And you need to practice a bit
That's my favorite mode
But Keenan please play the salmon run tutorials at least
It's probably subsided a bit by now
I'm glad I avoided ranked for the first week because I heard it's crazy with all the S+ players from the first game trying to get back to their former ranks
Which doesn't change the balance that much
But your level is no indication of your skill it just allows you access to better gear
Most I've seen is +/- 7 levels from myself
Nintendo switch online
I've never seen anything with so much discrepancy before

I have a pretty high winrate because i played early when no one but Wii u owners and free demo players were experienced
:(
To make up for it
There's no mechanic of holding notes so they do some crazy things with the button combos
They make sense after a few tries
Also i had about 5-7 hours of the play time on the free weekends
Well I'm very experienced at the rhythm game
Alright I'll be S rank by Sunday
Ok what specifically am I allowed to play
What about tomorrow
Why
But i want to play now
Well hurry up
What lvl are you
Asher what do i get you
That's more than real life
Jeez there's 17 different clothing brands in Splatoon
No that was just released today.
Got it on Amazon for 10
no they just changed their logo and now there's less color variety in the dota 2 scene
no more grean teams
i cant believe OG got rid of their green logo
My physical game soundtrack collection is slowly growing

I will get
This game looks cool
https://youtu.be/F4F5Zeww1iU
hold on idk why my mic isnt working
<@!125452744440938497> dota?
This gif is so satisfying https://gfycat.com/ColdRareKittiwake
which would not be very good for a robo boy
i thought you meant he was on a boat
theres a lot of squiggles
how do you track a turtle
same one?
it's back?
yeah we decided this when they announced it remember
no but im sure there will be
sept 29 bloomington indiana best buy
for snes
"glitch"
more fun that way
its ok im still fine with waiting in line
rip
https://clips.twitch.tv/LightCalmApeStoneLightning
lol these short films
sure
yes
no anyone can create a playlist
its just a playlist i have sorted by most views
its not my most played
this is a good stream <@!125452744440938497> https://www.twitch.tv/siractionslacks
they just like animals a lot
botw is a furry game
lol
no wonder they like sidon so much
ok i looked at that channel and it's all either zelda or furry stuff
im sure an rpg like this already exists
next year there will be a lv 3000 reward for a solid gold block of cheese
i think roshan is kind of a boring character to have a collectors item of
http://blog.dota2.com/2017/07/level-2000-collectors-baby-roshan/
still no vevo level
where almost everything on the undertale playlist is above 1-2 million views
most other games only have a few or several standout tracks in terms of popularity
i think undertale might still be the most popular video game soundtrack overall
which is probably why
literally the equivalent of the duck song
but the magikarp song?
that one makes sense
im surprised about those two pokemon songs because the magikarp one is only a month old and the other one iskind of obscure from a new game
i thought undertale would be first
somewhat surprising top 10 songs in my playlist by views
https://youtu.be/1A4faLHDx_U
<@!125452744440938497> dota?
Peridot
Hey I saw that green person as graffiti in Splatoon
ok one sec
do you want to play?
<@!125452744440938497> are you in a game?
That would be a very bad thing
Yeah you don't want to scare her
Is that the loch Ness monster?
🐢
This one is better because it has Pikachu https://youtu.be/-pFrbF9dqXs
Thank
Pls listen https://youtu.be/xVIx_QZpeKs
I'm going to get banned from Splatoon because my internet go out
it will be so funny if planet odd actually win this tournament
this is insane https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-1-6wHTwDA
you can also do will call if you lose them
yeah

and that completes my hard-to-find shopping list for this year
the last thing i need to preorder is the metroid special edition
because how are they the only preorder right now
i feel like walmart broke some kind of agreement

doing my part
who needs boots when shadow blade gives you movement speed
these pre-ti post-invite tournaments can be weird
no they said it just features the main broadcast but enhanced with contextual overlays and stuff
they easily could have slotted some people that deserved it there
like whats up with that
also its nice that they have the newbie stream again but they dont even have separate talent casting it
theres already like 4 reddit threads about him lol
if not chobra
i think sheever or kotlguy would be a better fit
i just dont think machine really meshes well with the other dota personalities
yeah he was great
also idk if it's just me but i dont really like machine
winter is always good too
like synderen and ppd and fogged
i think they just should have stuck with the established pros
ccnc is really smart but he's also literally never casted before
and then just get invited anyway
they can fail to qualify to ti
like players dont even need to work
all the talent they didnt invite literally need events to make money
those people can make a living playing dota or streaming
also they invite so many pros
lol
or lumi
and then they invite pyrion
these people work really hard throughout the entire year
no grandgrant
no lacoste
and they snub people like kotlguy who still grinds his ass off even though he already has a prominent place in the scene
valve keeps inviting people like lumi and pyrionflax who barely do any dota events the whole year
again
im very dissappointed with the talent list
him getting taught by purge was an elaborate plan this whole time to take over dota
day9 hosting ti
Pikmin
more of it
but money
lol
Cloud 9 picked up np
Da fuck
Everyone knows event destributed shinies are fake trash
: )
i think ronald should parse the death message even further and make it so each of them is a quote from the monster that killed you
what the hell
i get screen tearing
i do not know why my text editor isnt scrolling at 60 fps
i know but this is exposing me to vocabulary that i dont need to be exposed to
like apparently i am a "llama badger"
i have no clue as to whats a racial slur and whats not in this thing
Lol this trailer
https://youtu.be/Mn6uqp_mr98
id pay for that
they should expand on that
his best set is still that wolf one from like 4 years ago
maybe he'll get an actual sniper rifle
any of the spirits could get cool arcanas
which i doubt will even happen
the most they will do is tint them green or something
which they arent going to do
people just want valve to make custom effects for every stealable spell in the game
Although most of the best rubick sets we're ultra rares that are way more expensive than an arcana
Yeah
Sniper has at least two immortals
One of these things is not like the other

im trying to be productive
im about to release minecraft 2
nuh
even ive seen flubber

No
there was a 3 minute period that asher was on by himself
because asher spent most of the time talking to megan and looking at sheep
it was keenan
asher was on 49 minutes
keenan was on for 77 minutes
i just did su
oh
so i can read the logs
ronald whats the super user password
penis block
ez
im going to destroy it if no one comes forth
havent been on at all
check the logs
it uses glowstone and i dont own any glowstone
?
but i dont believe its him since he can only build cubes
NICE ALIBI ASHER
and also hate granite
also you know i had plans for the rock
except for 15 min tonight when i checked
i havent played all day
da fuck
RONAAAAALD
da fuck
!?!?
k
will anything break if i just rplace the jar
it's basically an alternate jar file for the server
a serverside plugin platform
<@!127535721857679362> can you tell me where the server files are located so i can convert it to bukkit
71.4 is really good mbps
71.4 what
Yeah
We could do that but we would need to switch to bukkit
@everyone it's going down
ok
7uhijlk;'
I have plenty of iron
Because the cube is so small we hardly need any rails
That connect everything except for Keenan
I think we should have overground rails
Alright great
So I can think about roads and my entrance
Can you make your stairway sometime soon
Oh also
It could connect to his dungeons
Your castle is still hard to access
That's not the same
Why you can't even get to your castle from my.base Keenan
Ronald can I connect with you?
Can I at least make it look destroyed in the middle with mossy cobble and vines
He does he's just shy about saying it
Pls
Then it's the cookie factory.
You don't want that eithet
Then he wins his stability argument
We can't have that
Destroying it would make Asher's cube the longest standing structure
Monument
That bridge is a moment
And is the oldest standing structure on the map
It's a symbol of friendship between two castles
Yeah he is that bridge is my most valuable asset to the server
I thought you kept falling on purpose
I'm really interested in using it as a flying platform
Let me know when your tower is done too
I'm going to need one of Megan's llamas
I agree but it's still not complete
I meant on his own
I want Ronald to figure it out
And the other is top secret
One of them is underground
I have two pumpkin farms
Which is gone
A video game
You'd have to build upwards
Because I don't need to expand to the jungle anymore
Me too
Actually I'm going to build roads connecting places next
Lol
Yeah you have
I need something new to do
If you want me to help with that I can after I finish moving my stuff into my tree
Did you do the same to the tower?
Yeah it's nice
i would be very sad
everyone has to be friends
i dont think anyone should be pissed about anything, there's limited space in this map
oh it's really small
I want to see the overhang
She doesn't seem like the type of person to do that
Smart
But what does he do on weekends
ronald how come you never play
Yeah
i like the mugs and the spirit pillows
<@!125452744440938497> https://valvestore.welovefine.com/title/detailView/the-secret-shop.html
thanks
you did i was just wondering if you got them back from the backup
by chance do you have those bones again
hey asher
if you tell what directory the minecraft forlder is in i can do it
this should be a 2 second operation
https://mcuuid.net/?q=Ishamael96
oh nvm
ronald go into world > playerdata
yeah just go to the backups folder and look for the latest asher.dat
what if yo u dropped your inventory down the hole and just dont remember it
i have my items
theres also one for each player which contains inventory information
i think it contains stuff like item values in chests and how loot spawns from monsters and rewards from world-generate chests
ip/map
just the map
anything gamestop doesnt sell is retro
with node and shit
idk what you're doing
no i cant
the caveat is that we cant play at night
all computers playing just have to be near sunlight and i'll use photon energy to transmit data between us
the key feature is that it wont require internet to play multiplayer
working on it
yeah same
no on e is even on minecraft
lol why
who that
so just a lil stunky
is it not a wild one
yes
did he do his thing?
TOO FAR
MOJANG
WTF
YOU CAN CRAFT MOSSY COBBLE NOW WITH VINES
ALRIGHT WTF
Why dont you make a thing that texts you when Megan is on
Can you make backups again
Oh ok
its like playing through smb for the first time using warps and then saying you beat the game and never come back to it
its just skipping the biggest aspect of any zelda game
it would be pretty sad
like imagine if ocarina of time let you skip half the dungeons
because people can get away without seeing a lot of their designs
i wish they didnt make shrines optional
dungeons are the core of zelda games
you basically only played half the dungeons
you could also beat zelda
got to get into the indie games
switch only has the new stuff until VC
right now you seemed more concerned with catching up on stuff
yeah because all the games you awnt to play are there
i think you just have too many games to play
the bed also doesnt work so anytime i die i spawn on a random location on your tower
yeh
the humble one
hey btw when you get the time can you relocate your hole
y no one talk
no
he even talks about his tf2 roots
i was going to tell you about it but forgot
yeah
If you want to come early too
Ok we getting there early
<@125452744440938497> you are driving yourself right?
they had a cd?
?

just changing the song
i love it because its not changing footage from the game
oh ive seen that too
i wish i had a reference point though for actual oblivion
the music is what makes these
yeah it's  weird game when you think of it that way
from the last podcast?
i wonder what that kid is doing now
you dont even have to parody these
ive seen that one before
ive been here the whole time
"rare footage of a human eating his dinner"
im just sitting here watching all of them and then doing nothing waiting for the next to come in
i can only consume so many youtubes in one day
please stop
NC must be an interesting place with this kinf of news
when that video first cuts to nick it gets me every time
theres a gamecube version of that which is way worse sounding
ive been to this part of youtube already
pikachu
wtf is happening in that last video
https://youtu.be/ooNlLzm2wRA
let me make sure @everyone sees it
but you havent watched it enough
https://youtu.be/ooNlLzm2wRA
😦
<@127535721857679362> why did I stop receiving these

I also have mined more redstone than logs
I
I checked my stats and have died 120 tomes
Thanks
What
I liked him
He looks like a dad
<@127535721857679362> are you going?
You can try de mambo
Õk
It's a curve and you just need to find the perfect spot in the middle
I think that's actually worse though because then you just have to wait in the hallway
Lol
Helps with tolerating people
We should go as early as possible
I saw that picture yesterday and just wondered when I would see it again in the discord
Is this what happens every time one of us posts a picture on Facebook
ok
i need to win my tokens

<@!125452744440938497> asher do you want to play dota?

as soon as gamestop stops selling wii games then they will become retro

http://www.pcgamer.com/stardew-valley-creator-i-certainly-dont-want-my-game-to-cause-harm-to-any-guinea-pigs/
it got no real replies
dont worry i already made my one a while ago
Ronald's the basement flooding expert here
<@!125452744440938497> do you still want to play a game?
still waiting for pixel though
thats tempting
yeah they are very light
think of them as just a really really nice speaker that happens to reside near your ear
they also dont block out sound if you're looking for that
they are nice but apparently they even bleed trhough horror noises
the tall version of the echo is a pretty good wireless speaker but if you just wanted a speaker there are better ones for the price
and even if so, google has a better ecosystem
i don think they're as useful as they sound
im not totally aboard the whole smart home thing yet
not really
have fun flying around our extremely small area
i put the wings in a chest near the nether portal
probably a bit why
it's already the most prominent structure
your castle is starting to look good
i think you can add more views
yeah
that seemed pretty quick
for tomorrow night
you should make the render smooth lightning and add another angle
only a few blocks away
i think they are down smith or third street
ok i can see them from my window
they sound pretty close to me but im not sure where exactly they are
its fucking july fucking 8
they are doing fireworks near mine
they could have just happened to be the same
its not a very long poem
the internet is a big place
it might just be coincidence
and the remake for super star
thats good you'l have snes mini for alttp
they deserve to be beaten
have you beaten any of those
yes
he probably took all the glowstone
he went to the nether
<@!127535721857679362>
ronald what are you doing with the server
yeah
i have one
some have been spawning in my mines
and i know animals cant
well the wiki says entities cant pass through
but im pretty sure ive seen them moving through it
ok they ccant move through it apparently
i dont know if they can spawn outside the box but i think they can walk outside
k
<@!155893986605793281>
its ready
keenan
we really need sugarcane
i think you can get leather from llamas
im going to build my house out of the blocks
no
i not
she just logged off
i'll understadn
im on too
and it just called her a filthy casual again
she probably tried to chat with it
lol do you really think ronald would personally text us every time he sees we die
he probably wants to add her to t he list
it's prretty cool
i just mean from a technical level
the gap between 1 and 3 is insane and they dont even look like games from the same console
it's really incredible how much mario improved between smb1 and 2 and 3
thats megan
it's by the genius behind cave story
anyone can have that because it's drm free
i also have kero blaster
why you cant play it
I also have an extra copy of undertale for some reason
i would gift you dark souls 2 if you had a pc to play it on
now i own dark souls 2 and hyper light drifter
i keep accidentally buying games because im subscribed to humble monthly
you have to be pretty good if you can win a tournament while picking a different set of 5 heroes each game
one of them
at the summit 7, they played every game without repicking the same heroes once and won
they were invited lol
ye
neither have i really but he was at ti quals i think
maybe you just got used to it
<@!127535721857679362> ronald you shoudl watch this tetris race starting soon https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick
ccnc is really smart
mason probably thinks hes good too
hes not mason
of course
https://www.twitch.tv/ppd
buying new packs
you could at ti4
you should really be able to trade
i have an all silver np though
but im one silver away from having all silver dc for the favorite team thing
im too lazy to recycle all my duplicates
i know miposhka
who dat
ive played that games and i cant even drive straight
holy crap this guy is perfect at mario kart 64
but he's good for fantasy points
not like it really matters, og wasnt going to be set as my favorite team anyway
hes the only card im missing
i dont even have a common one
since you cant trade im pretty sure
theres no real reason to keep duplicates
what
its just surrounded by microsoft buildings
its not literally inside
its in the middle of the microsoft campus
you can see the sign at least
i really want to see nintendo too but im 100% sure you cant get any tour or even go inside
you should try to do it on thursday
im so glad they went back to the regular all-star match format
or during the day as well for games we dont care about
i think the best time to do stuff other than ti would be the mornings before noon and the evenings
ronald when are you leaving on sunday?
nooo wtf 75 packs and no jerax
ok try this ERUSHBY379
i know on the home page when you initially put in the flight criteria there's a promo code box
is there a promo code option
so the flight departs at 6:50 am in estern time?
oh ok
this is going to take ages
omg i have 75 player card packs to open
idk if i'll leave on the same flight or not depends on seats
we can probably drive up to the airport together
oh ok just wondering
there's a 3 hour time difference too so wouldnt you get there at around 7 am
leave bloomington that time?
or plane departs that time
and we could figure it out then
if flights really are that busy i might not be able to find one either
there's a lot you could do in the meantime
ok check out is noon
its like 10 or so blocks away think?
the place is downtown is within walking distance to the trainline that goes to the airport
Where would you go lol
I can check
Yeah do that
I might also have to do that if I can get on any flight Sunday
Is it cheaper to do that and get a hotel?
You can check other airlines but idk if they'd be different
Yeah I think that's what my mom was talking about.
Sundays are a really busy day to leave

but also a waste of time
that was cool
i just watched the entire 4 hour twilight princess speed run
It's not a big deal if you don't though
If you can't do it in the config for overviewer you should try in the URL since coords can get passed in there
Can you set the center to the spawn when we load that page
I'm not sure
are you just wathcing the latest.log file?
its a good mechanic but seems pretty hardcore
because theres a lot of lava
no thats mean
besides your texts
because since you dont lose items theres no penalty
that may actually be a good punishment for dying
lol
well thats your job
anything else we basically already have done
what should it be then
because otherwise we cant get to the end with our border
and to do that we spawn in an end portal
i think the first goal should be beating the dragon
but getting wings from the end is actually kind of fun
maybe mending book for the wings
im pretty sure thats it
i can generate one
dont i just need a public private key pair
why
oh ok i thought you said every 12 hours
you mean you'll update the map twice a day?
what do you mean
ok good
but that file would be like 5 gigs
i think at one point i thought about rendering it on my local computer and the using sftp to transfer a compressed file
its definitely more than what i had
you could google it and see if other people have it take a long time
idk
maybe it did take a long time
lol
that makes sense
or less
maybe it should be about half that for the first time
but thats seems really long
i cant remember hoiw long it took for me
the eta might also not be accurate
if you stop the server it might be faster
but it definitely takes longer the first time
i dont think it should take that long
but you could just run the bot on the server as well
oh i havent looked at it
i want to see the source code when it's done
with the exception of a few special commands for stopping the server and starting the server
and then every message sent by people other than the bot is stuffed to the screen console on the server
no you just make the channel a live feed of the console
its way easier to manage the server through discord than a website
.
yeah
and you can put in commands through there or see the logs
i think it would be cool if there was a discord channel that was just the server console directly basically
are you just going to text the server commands
thanks
basically 4d
it's adds a whole new dimension to the gaming experience
its pretty cool if you think about it
someone must have killed me
i already got a text
why was the server closed
ronald spends 2 hours cooking with his buds
:()
ronald why dont you play
keenan i finished my ugly farm just for you
h
wa
yeah
this is also neat https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/11/child-processes-streams-minecraft-multiplayer-server-nodejs.html
i think i used something like this script https://github.com/ThomasDepole/Easy-PHP-Tail-/blob/master/tail.php
im pretty sure that live updates
are you reading from the latest.log file
you can add a sleep 15s
or with cron
because you can space it out with sleep
is it all one bash script or separate lines on crontab
it takes a second for the server to stop
isnt that a security issue
cant you just have an object mapping our names to our phone numbers
i dont think you need a switch
lol
cool
keenaan isnt even playing right now
then give the number
go to the console and type seed
give us the seed
you arent even online wtf
He should be able to get you the seed from his phone
Pm him
Ronald can give it to you with /seed
Maybe it's only funny when it's Russian yelling
I've definitely yelled at dota videos before
Dota is really popular there
Nether
We can also access the better and build in a 128x128 area there
128x128
What if I just built a giant cobblestone platform in the sky to start a new city
Never come back up
You should just go underground right away
Keenan is going to lose it
They are trying to make it more accessible for the younger audience
We are going back to our roots
This discord was founded on Minecraft servers
Yes please
No it's not going to get big that fast
So it will get more robust
We all have to build in the same space
It will though
Farms and stuff can be central since there's not much space
Because I do want to build my own shit too
It's fair right
Oh well whatever that's what was intended
Until stuff is more sustainable
It just says we live together and share at the beginning when resources are tight
Asher's cube is probably just an incomplete palace
Because building takes time
Or makes them better
Look at the pin
Or you know just tp
They are pinned
Just get the seed
No did you read the official rules
My house is going to be in the jungle
You can build a castle
Idk it's a pretty crazy mountain
The mountain is at the intersection of three other biomes
Hence the first thing I did was make cocoa farm
No in realism i would mainly eat cookies
It's important to me to have food for realism
Apples aren't really farmable fast
Melons suck asa food source
There aren't really fruits
Don't use the jungle corner though
Well we don't have much space rn so just pick a corner and make farms there
Yeah
Ronald was saying that if this is going to be a city and the spawn is the center, farms shouldn't be near the center
And build it into some.building
I want to hollow out that whole rock though
So you can move it
Everything on that spawn point is temporary
You can harvest them but don't break the stems unless you want to replant somewhere
A penis color one and a big ass one
He actually had two cubes
Like he always does
Asher can maintain his cube
Yeah
Idk what Asher's thing is
Not Asher's cube
Where the spawn is
Anything on top of that cube is temporary
So don't destroy those either
We also had a single melon plant
Unfortunately it didn't drop saplings so we are out of jungle wood
No we had a single jungle tree with beans
By the time to play on Friday it will actually be good
You can't just destroy anything you want
I'm.being efficient
It's not going to be destroyed
You only have to breed every once in a while
Chickens just grow naturally
Fishing takes time away from other things
I wanted a source of meat as soon as possible
That takes time
No some idiot might kill them because they think they respawn
Because chickens needed to be perserved
I'm not going to wait until I can make a beautiful farm when I needed seeds now
You will be challenged when you can't do what you want because you don't have the materials
I don't think you even know
It's just the starter
It's not going to be the real farm
It's going to have a natural look when I'm done
There's a clear differencd between a nice looking farm and a only stone mountain
Do you even understand Minecraft
Fountain takes only stone to make
It takes a while
The farm wasn't going to be completed until I got enough seeds
You're wrong dude there are a lot of limited resources
I played for 1 hour
It will take time
This is a challenge map
I don't see how it can not be
It doesn't matter I still wanted to preserve the animals as soon as possible because we could lose them forever
They are persistent and only grow with breeding
They made that change a very long time ago with the new biomes
Animals don't respawn
They can
Idk what that is
Don't have carrots or potatoes
Can't breed pigs
Sort a time dependent thing
Because if all the chickens died we wouldn't have any meat
Needed seeds to bread the chickens
Because I wanted to start the farm  fast
So I needed to make it near water
You have to consider we didn't have iron when I made that farm
And the farm isn't complete dummy
The bridge is my beautiful boy
I haven't seen the cube
The dirt hut?
Like what
We do enough for me not to build anything out of it right now
And no wool
And no glass
And iron
We have very limited amount of wood
What do you expect a beautiful mansion
Yeah
That's a pretty major game
We also haven't beaten Minecraft yet
No keenan
That's a lot of whole days
Common stuff
Anytime someone leaves for a week you risk this happening to you
It's going to be ugly at the beginning
Wow
There's a bridge and a dirt hut
It's actually impossible to find a better spawn
We found a spawn too good
You seemed fine playing without asher on the ftb map
You should do something with PayPal or venmo so that everytime we die we lose 50 cents
Because that would v really encouraged me not to die
Yeah but are you actually going to set that up

<@!127535721857679362> ronald are you literally going to sms us when we die
but theres a chance something like that already exists for minecraft and discord integration
would be a lot of programming
you could do that
you're hurting me
use the command screen -S screenname stuff "/stop\n"
its not the proper way to close the server
because its bad
yeah dont do that
you need to send the command stop to the screen instance
yes
but there should be logs
are you stopping the server with "stop"
isnt there a logs folder
yeah it should
but do you mean in real time and then putting it on a webserver?
i think it creates logs automatically
im changing my minecraft settings
we going to fly
come
asher
thats how you be a good admin
yeah
<@!125452744440938497> <@!155893986605793281>
LETS DO THIS
ASHER COME
also i th ink i found a good spawn
well im online now so it should work
OP ME
<@!127535721857679362> RONAAAALD
Let asher log on and try to op him
It just let's me use admin commands to set the spawn and world border
In the server console type op mango_mac
So I can do it with asher
Then just make me op
When I come on in a bit we can fly around and find a good spawn
No
It's bad to store raw folders
But I would still compress it
You can try it
Also aren't all versions of the folder still stored locally somewhere
Does git have unlimited storage?
Lol that sounds a little strange
I spaced them out by like 5 minutes though because I needed to do more steps to render the map
It should be fine to backup while the server is running
We want our job to run at 5 A.M., which would be minute 0, hour 5, every day of the month, every month, every day of the week.
We need to add a line to the bottom of the file which looks like this:

0 5 * * * /home/myname/scripts/do-every-day.sh
Actually nevermind it's reveresed
I think
* * * 5 *
In an hour.
You should help
The only reason for saving old backups is if you wanted to make a time lapse or something
You can also just manually delete old stuff every week
You basically just provide a list of times and the corresponding path of the script you want to run at that time
Tis really easy to use
No cron is just a different program
So the screen has to be named the same thing everytime
Cron is separate from screen but in order to stop the server you need to send a stop command to the screen instance
What do you mean
I do still have my scripts for that
Because restarting sometimes helps fix bugs and shit so it's good to do it everyday
And then run thkse every day as well
I would write simple bash script that you can run to stop and start the server through the screen
Ronald you are using screens right?
IT just ruins your internet for everyone else in the house though
It's pretty easy to set up if you really want to
Why can't we stream it on twitch
Asher the fuck house needs a spawn point first
They each were compressed tar files with the date of the backup in file name
No I put the backups in a new folder called backups but it was located on the same instance
Yeah
The world folder
And also restarted the server at that time
And then I ran the bash script every day at 5 am
So backups wouldn't override each other
I put it in a bash script that inserted the current date into the new file name
I think the command is tar -zcf targetworld/ new/path.tar
And saved backups to a separate folder as tar zips
I just used a cron job to run a simple tar coand every morning at 5 am
No but their recommended method is probably better
Are you following the official Google cloud Minecraft server guide
His diamond script works
Fuck he did it.
You don't even have the same excuse as Ronald I can see the discord icon right there
Why didn't you take a screenshot
Asher
In our 4 player mmo
That's the role you play
You are going to be the criminal throughout the whole server
Well it's too late for that
It's not going to be hard to catch if we all live in the same 64 chunks
He has to look up how to turn on cheats
We don't have the spawn
Asher don't play yet
We could make it 128x128 so that it's exactly 64 chunks
I mean we would just all get banned
I like the idea of a finite amount
I actually think we shouldn't expand until all the resources are gone
We'll be able to tell if all the diamonds are gone in our little square

Should we do the game rule where theres no inventory loss on death again
Lol
But idk if I'll remember
Cool I can try to find the plugins I used for that
It uses a lot of space
Most people say more than that but I don't care
You should back it up once a day
Cool
Ronald did you make it static ?
I think 150x150 might be good
We can expand it every day or week
Yeah
I think like 100-200 initially
Like what width
What do we want to set the square border as
You make me op and I'll do it
We can play tonight Ronald
Yes
It will be late there though
Yeah I'll let you confirm
When I get home today I can set up the spawn and the world border
I'm not playing a confined world border world with a shitty spawn
Make sure  <@155893986605793281> picks out a good spawn
This is what I used.
Make sure to install the jdk step too
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-get-on-debian-8
Other people won't care but I just won't play otherwise
Yes very
Hold on
You just have to add the repo to the package manager first
I installed Java 8 just fine took me 5 minutes
Fuck no
<@127535721857679362> Ronald after a year could you just activate another year or do they expire before then
The blue haired girl you are talking about wasn't available to marry when i played
But in a replay I would probably marry Abigail because her cutscenes involve gaming
Oh her name is Leah
Asher she was the red haired person at the South exit of the farm
Why would you do whitelist lol
I forgot the name of the person i married
and then set the world border around that area
i think we should fly around in creative and  find a good spawn before starting
and change all the settings without remembering the flags
because you can save different profiles easily
yeah but there are certain features that putty simplifies which is nice
with that much ram you could probably allocate 3gb to minecraft and still use the instance to do other things
they make the most difference when there are lots of players and they are spread out
well ssds are probably faster but i think for us it wont make much of a difference
i just googled it
i think hdds are fine
oh im not sure if that's worth it
because if it was ssd i think the world woudl load faster
does changing it to ssd change the price?
he probably doesnt have discord on his mac
yeah if it doesnt change the price
i wonder if when one year runs out you could activate another year
it's valuable shit
lol
we wont ever have more than 6 concurrent players
im pretty sure for vanilla i got away with 3.5 total with 3 allocated to minecraft
yes
for a heavily modded server yes
i dont think it's necessary
thats a lot of ram
the old map was replaced every night but it's still 5gb
it was
last time the map files took up like 5 gigabytes
we'll only have storage issues at 10gb if we want to have a live map
i owould also make sure to select a persistent ssd disk instead of hdd because i dont think it costs extra if it's lesss than 50gb
i think it was 2 or 3
i cant remember what i did for vanilla last time
for the FTB server i used 4.5 gb instance with 4gb of allocated ram
command blocks are a way of scripting within minecraft
http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/World_border
no it's a built in command
it is since it can be done with command blocks
because we never do
i like the idea of forcing us to all live near each other
like have an expanding world border with command blocks
if we are going to do vanilla i at least want to play it in a somewhat different style than our normal servers
i will
but i might play an hour of it every night instead of dota
so idk how much i will play it
i have a lot of other games i kind of want to play first
we could
the guy speed running banjo right now is basically a TAS machine
ok
earth isnt infinite like minecraft is
minecraft is technically better than reality
Holy shit iceiceice is streaming
That's what Xenoblade does to me
new patch pogchamp
sure
So your three interests are cannons turtles and pineapples
The fuck
Regardless of how many points you have
But you can't be invited if you changed after the roster lock
So doing that is only worth it if you perform at tI and all the events leading up to it
Yeah but also the roster lock happens a decent amount of time before TI itself
The other thing is that SA and CIS are officially separate regions now
I think the only way a team would get players with varying points is through shuffles
Yeah because it just seems like the amount of points you earn will be a factor of placement, proximity to TI, and total prize pool
Yeah in theory that would work but I still think it's risky to do that because you need to also work well together and have teamwork
I guess we will directly be able to see the best players and teams based on QP
<@125452744440938497> <@127535721857679362> Wow valve is completely changing competitive dota.
http://blog.dota2.com/2017/07/the-2017-2018-competitive-season/
Wow valve is completely changing competitive dota
they are doin all 300 stages wtf
how the hell is the super monkey ball deluxe speedrun 1 and half hours long
yeah a lot of times you dont even see the hosts
keenan are you staying in a air bnb?
lol i'll ask
which is really useful
also that place comes with 4 bikes
they could easily find someone else
i think it's too high in demand right now
we could only do that if we had a bible to put between us
im pretty sure in new york you roomed with nikhil
did we do that
i know we all dont care where we sleep but it just seems really small for 5 people
it only has one bedroom and the other beds are both in the living room
i looked at that place
depends where
o
probably a little bigger than indiana
i didnt know he lived there
well now its clearly fake


You would paying 180 thought since you're staying three nights
I looked for a while and there's nothing cheaper.
It won't be split evening either.
There price is 60/night since my mom and her friend are subsidizing us
I don't know it has that feel of rogue like which I really like
It gets pretty deep
Then you're not relationship building, mining, fishing, questing, foraging, or completing the main community center objectives
There's a ton of gameplay variety for a farming games
Not true
They are ignoring the pub scene where he already has zero presence
He has a 100% competitive winrate but that's because teams either plat it really well or they can't at all and don't pick it
He doesn't need nerfs
I'm so pissed
Selling cola to everyone
Is there about to be a mega corporation taking over the town?
Now I'm lucky enough to be done with it until the Switch version comes out
Did for me for about 2 weeks straight
If you play it enough it will become your actual life
lol
Lucky for me when I played it I didn't have to wake up early every day
Yes
i doubt it
Probably Tuesday morning
Only one that I found earlier was close to the train and it was the same price
you can look though
there isnt really thing else thats cheaper and still in a decent location
yea
my mom and her friend would each get a bed and plus they are willing to subsidize us so we would each end up paying about 60 dollars per night which is a really good deal for us
yeah but it's hard to find anything cheaper in that area
its a 5 minute walk to key arena
what do you guys think of this place https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19626395?min_bedrooms=2&sw_lat=47.58030823682654&source=handoff-ios&ne_lng=-122.308984989952&sw_lng=-122.3857181592344&search_by_map=true&adults=4&min_beds=2&zoom=12&min_bathrooms=1&guests=4&ne_lat=47.64927720821676&s=39&ref_device_id=1fcfb2ab98df1475b7f367266bf94d158195d63c&user_id=21781383&_branch_match_id=410174425881246115 <@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362>
ye
i should have recorded our dota game last night and made a compilation video of asher's maniacal laughing
I wont
<@125452744440938497>  summer games done quick is starting soon with nier
Who dat
ok
<@!125452744440938497> yeah give me a minute
thats in the description for new donk city
Natives: New Donkers
Area: Big
Population: Crowded
ard you just playing the first one on ds?
yes
the launcher is just open all the time and it says that even if im not running a game
its the same reason dolphin is always open
smart
for that easy grinding
is it like a summon to draw all the monsters near
does the lightning bolt make you more attractive
lol
whats repeat
i thought on tinder there was only left and right
what do all those buttons mean under the picture
i havent seen the end of the season yet so i dont know what happens but i read that erlich isnt coming back
yeah but doesnt that mean his character had to be written out
i dont know how i feel about silicon valley continuing without him
it feels weird watching the last three episodes of this knowing that t.j.
miller was written out
and why isnt it taken down
does stuff come out when it airs
hows it work
normally these things are 480 max
wow is this really 720p
and i dont even know if im going to watch that week by week or just wait until the whole sesason is out
i dont feel like getting it again until got
no i forgot and my hbo thing expired
and theres nothing to watch movies or tv wise and even if there was iim too bored for that too
dont want to sleep but also dont feel like playing any game
like i said
im pretty bored
and have been for the past 3 hours
im just in the menu
no one posts anything interesting
i just checked facebook for the first time in over a month
friend request semt
lol
we also probably wont want to watch every game
we can hang out for lunch and dinner and stuff
even if it gets you food the stadium food probably isnt good
im not sure
yeah it's weird
if i dont have any reason to tell someone something I wont
you guys should know that i dont really talk to people about stuff unless asked about it
also about the friend thing
and will be activated soon
it says it's being processed
yeah thanks
i just feel like i have too much else to do until i could really get into it
i would if i got into it
asher 100% would
unless it's vanilla
i could but it feels like kind of a waste if keenan isnt going to play on it
really he must have deleted his old one
that can run a server for months
wow
its 404
i cant find the redeem page
didnt you say they expire at the end of the event?
that shit is valuable
cool thanks
are you sure you want to give that to me
how many of those do you have
do they expire?
is that for minecraft?
wtf is that
haley drabek bought a pineapple plant at ikea with me
willa mannering is a good friend from my lab
alvaro michael is another
havent seen him in a while though because he's been in sweden
im good friends with jack zhang
anyone who is my friend on facebook who isn't from highschool i probably talk to frequently
then just look at my facebook friends
are you going to look them up on facebook
they all serve their purposes
i just tend to keep my friend groups very distinct
what do you want me to say
well other people you wouldnt know
pretty good at listening
with nikhil its mainly him though i do a lot of listening
with  someone like nikhil or roger who im a lot closer with we occasionally talk about girls or politics or interesting developments in science
or life in general
or interesting stuff we are learning about
most of it probably boils down to school or work talk
its not like specific stuff
ok keenan well in general i talk about things that are a lot less focused than our discussions
i mean do i really have to list examples
pretty much everything that i dont talk to you guys about
i dont do a lot of college things but i still talk to a lot of people
i mean i go to college
literally the only people i can talk to about that
it's okay you guys are still the only friends i have who understand video games
you wouldnt know anyone besides roger and nikhil
and im not very big
but also it's paintball
i might have gone if less people were going
i didnt literally mean all
makes me sad
all my friends are going to indy on sunday to play paintball and im not going because i dont like large groups of people

its that time of the night again where i get really bored and dont want to go to bed but it's too late to start playing a game
wow people have pretty shitty bios
make sure to tell them that Mac wants a cookie like the good old days
mario
but anyway
she looks crazy
it looks like a throwback picture from the early 2000s
lol that picture looks so old
im trying to have a discussion about mario here
yeah i do like how it has a lot of secrets
it's not a very forgiving game
i think thats really hard to do
you just get 5000
but im pretty sure you cant
unless i'm that bad at perfect flag poles
and you dont get 1-ups from perfect flagpoles
yeah but you have to do that many without running out of lives
i want to see how you beat it without using shortcuts
i still think it's a really hard game if you dont use restore points
are you proud
well see it
keenan did you see my pinned message
the top lady is the same as the bottom lady
what about the first part of that tweet
i'll figure it out
oh we'll have separate rooms for sure because im pretty sure they at least want a bed
i personally dont care where i sleep, dont know if you guys do
also we can also cut costs by sleeping on couches or floors
as in they are deifnitely not going to ti lol
i think they have their own plans
it will make things a lot cheaper
yeah if you dont mind i think they are planning on it
the train goes straight to the space needle which is where key arena is
a lot of places are either close to the bus line or the train
no train
i think it will make it easier to find places but also a little cheaper
yeah
<@!125452744440938497> dota?
So I was thinking check-in Tues and check out Sunday versus mon-sun or mon-sat
It might be hard to find somewhere available for all 6 nights
We would save on a night  and if we fly out early on Tuesday we would still get there around 10 am because of the time difference
Would you be ok with missing Monday?
Lol
My mom brought up the point that plane tickets leaving Seattle on Sunday are way more expensive than leaving on Saturday, so Asher may want to leave on Saturday instead but he would probably miss some games that day
Yeah we should discuss it


https://youtu.be/ax6Xfbmn7uU
When are you coming and leaving
When are your plane tickets for again?
Yeah actually so does my mom's friend
He's b basically streaming games at 60 fps to a web browser that's he's building into a native switch app
No it's way more interesting from a technological standpoint

Lol
all of team B)ears is also going on different teams except for feero who went to complexity
all of mvp pheonix is returning to TI on various teams
bulba fourth TI
and he's only now starting to cast
yeah i had no idea lacost had that much history
ti1 with fear's team and ti2 with misery paijkatt akke's team
wtf lacoste has played at two TIs
forev and bulba really carried that game which is something i'd never thought i would be saying these qualifiers
dc really stepped up their game today
lol i tuned into the moonduck stream 15 minutes after the dc freedom game ended and he's still talking about it
is it like the length of stanley parable?
at least you have cloud 9 this time
no misery, dendi, etc
no returning finalists, no returning champions
man we picked the weirdest ti to go lol
<@!125452744440938497> <@!155893986605793281> <@!127535721857679362> yo we should talk about seattle I need to know if keenan is going
they should have played in the EU qualifiers
moo's revenge
The "Smart Boy"
http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-29-play-game-boy-cartridges-on-your-smartphone-with-this-60-accessory
close
Elmo and the Sesame Street Spooks
it might be better than the flash
🗻 🗻  🚫 🅱 🅰 🇩
because idk how you could play dota without sound
everytime i get new heaphones i play dota
or playing fire emblem with top notch listening capability
lol
yeah its the sound quality that counts
you're just trying to justify what was clearly an impulse buy
i just had to get used to low volume
i used to have headphones that did that
this makes me too uncomfortable cant watch
he definitely uses a lot of pleasing sounds but his voice is definitely a joke i think
i dont listen to asmr so i cant tell if this video is actual asmr or a parody of it
ASMR
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRO-q5SijCc
i wonder which one it will be
if dc loses i'll just root for whatever team bulba ends up coaching
it's his cheeks
yeah they have a really good balance of memes/entertainment and serious casting
top 3 ti but then literally nothing else
well yeah but he's a weird situation
hasnt been there since ti4
but it would be really cool to see mason at ti
even though not really
i consider abed and mason new blood
and part of the reason for that is because they havent been to lans but still
especially when you compare them to all the great personalities on the other teams
so freedom has this great drive and motivation and stuff but i really don't like any of the players on that team
those two need to be on better teams
and even though i dislike complexity, I still would feel really bad for demon and moo as well
or the other half mvp in forev and dubu
it's cool to see new blood but i also think it will be a weird ti without some of the players on planet odd like misery
obviously im glad np won but they definitely didnt look at solid as freedom
yeah that is very true
thats more than winning at most lans these days
if you think about it, this is probably double elim because the winner automatically gets like 60k
then first of playoffs was qualified and second of playoffs was wildcard
by being top of group
secret qualified the same way
they totally did last ti
yeah literally every qualifier it's been this format
it just started late because of tiebreakers
i hasnt been very long
Holy fuck BTS just baited everyone so hard
k
this game is hilarious
teamfight where no one died
*4 rapiers
2nd longest dota game
thers an invincible queen of pain
this is hilarious empire has 5 level 5 dagons and they cant kill anyone
and it's a complete stalemate
<@!125452744440938497> this vega vs empire game is past 100 minutes and vega have been defending against megas for the past 50 minutes
lol at least they postponed till today
i havent been caught up with the last few episodes
after this season?
really?
thursday i think
if you want to use the discount you might want to wait to see if keenan is going so you can use it together
i feel like there will be a break before the next important na games
do you want to play dota?
i cant believe they are streaming sea next
cant beat infinitely scaling heroes
there's still like 4 more games plus probably tiebreakers
the NA teams are going to be up so late
at almost 80 minutes
<@!125452744440938497> the np / planet odd game is basically a stalemate right now
actually im fine with cheering for planet odd too
or liquid
otherwise i'll have to cheer for eg
im hoping at least np will make it
this is a disaster
fuck they did
are they top seed?
did np lose to freedom too?
lol
https://twitter.com/tobyfox/status/879726521338003456
no
ronald we can play competitive tetris
that's two moms at once
and henry's mom
you can hang out with my mom
there's no way he wont if you're coming
we will whenever keenan confirms
you'll also get to play my switch
cool
without tickets
and watch outside on the giant projector
you can also probably visit the secret shop though
yes
the weekend is twice as much probably because more happens and it's more in demand
yeah midweek are 100
it's the most eventful two days though
it's also 200 dollars for the weekend ticket so if you only want to go saturday that'd probably not be worth it
it's friday and saturday
but seattle is where all the companies that i actually use are
california is where all the companies are
thats also half the reason im going
yeah i really want to live/work in seattle
probably
idk
because it's like 4 months away
you mean why do i not know
idk i could
well ask him
It's a lot closer
I think that's pretty good
He could also use 20% discount
Idk ask asher
?
He said he would know on Thursday
Well duh you have to account for the cost of the ink cartridge
We can provide you with basically no lag for only 99.99
Tired of your pencil lagging?
I just like "real problems...answered."
No lag writing
Innovation

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYJvWqnSfbg
im also ready
i like this album btw
In a minute
<@!125452744440938497> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAZw8poR8pc
Plus if Keenan ndoesnt go you could buy our extra ticket
Yeah but we could still hang out at nights
Even if TI somehow gets cancelled I would still go as to not waste your plane tickets
Well considering Asher and I each have $300 invested already in tickets,pretty sure
For everyone else it can be more definitive if they buy tickets
Ideally but for me it depends on flights since I'm flying standby
Sunday
I'd want to leave Sunday
You generally can't fly west to east in the evening
https://twitter.com/Chinnerdomain/status/879396323933532161
it's so weird to see a snes get it's very first release in 2017
lol what if star fox 2 wins some award for 2017
http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/248/336/7f5.gif
Someone needs to make a new image of the ds printing money except with kimishima instead
Nintendo is going to make so much money this year
Which makes them a collector's item
Also they announced that as of now they are only shipping these through the end of 2017
I don't see why they would be scaled down
Well the European nintendo division NERD is likely the one making the emulator and they have a good track record since the NES classic emulator was very good
But I'm wondering if it's worse or better
Well I know
The get slightly different games but in a prettier console
I wonder if it's worth it
Actually what if the European localization of games is very different
But if I did that I would have to wait 6 days
It looks better too
You can preorder the European one on Amazon right now
That's because you're too cool and already own these games
Ik but I was hoping it would be right there in my mini
New artwork

I'm kind of sad theres no Chrono trigger or dkc2 because I really wanted to play those but the rest is top notch
LINE UP WITH ME
Keenan we are going to start lining up 5 hours before midnight right
Holy fuck I'm so excited
It comes with the unreleased star fox 2
Snes classic
<@155893986605793281>
<@155893986605793281>
Holy fuck
It depends if Ronald and Keenan come and if I can find adequate 5.5 person housing
Yes my mom and her friend might also be coming but it's uncertain if they'll still come if Ronald and Keenan do.
Because their main idea was to split costs while also hanging out in Seattle and doing their own thing
<@125452744440938497> make sure you read the earlier stuff because it concerns you
<@125452744440938497> make sure you read the earlier stuff because it concerns you
Yeah it's so late where you are
But you don't really need that if you aren't gaming or aren't doing deep learning stuff
I like the surface book simply because it can get really high specced with dedicated graphics and everything
I really like how there's no bezels but every laptop manufacturer is starting to do that now
i think i asked him that but there was some reason why he couldnt
im not sure
and roger got his about the same time
but nikhil didn't get the top of the line one and he bought it senior year of high school
he can only use it while plugged in
i think nikhil had to get his repaired and roger's didn't hold a battery charge after a year
nikhil and roger both had one but they both broke after a couple of years
because it's not goingto be the most powerful or most price efficient
like i would basically be buying a macbook for the operating system and high quality hardware alone
the other prpblem is that it's hard for me to justify buying a mac when similar priced windows laptops are way more value spec-wise
desktop for games and everyything else
laptop for coding and browing internet
yeah thats pretty much what my laptop/desktop workflow is like
running linux on a custom built desktop would bea  lot easier
at least on my dell ultrabook
it works but it's not perfect
it probably feels about the same as running ubuntu on a windows machine
you lack a lot of the same drivers
you can but it's not an ideal experience
and it's inferior and slow
but for research i use office a lot and it's always on my lab comptuers which are iMacs
i do for minor stuff
the other problem with a macbook is that i hate using the microsoft office suite on it
i want something more permanent
i really want to invest in a home server that i can just keep running 24/7 and ssh in whenever i need
true but my only real cloudspace is silo and i dont have sudo permissions there
it was useful
i used it a ton a year ago for a bunch of python programming
but im too lazy to switch to it
i already have a linux partition
but yeah some times programming on my pc is frustrating
which kind of sucks
well you also use windows 8
im actually considering a macbook for my next computer because i like unix a lot better for programming
then i could play tiny wings
what i just got an iphone
😦
i want them to go back to the nexus price point
i want to see the next pixel
my brother has a 3T and it's pretty nice
i feel like id rather get a 400 dollar phone every two years than an 800 dollar one every four years
im probably never going to buy one though  unless the price goes down substantially
cool i want to see it
<:armboy:307590740496875531>
ive never seen one before
irl
i just realized im going to get to see your 850 dollar phone
holy shit ronald
how many hours do you have to play
why
k
do you want to play shadows of valentia or are you just going to stick with fates
when are you leaving keenan
i only do on weekends
i used to stay up too late catching beetles
i feel like i know the 12am-3am animal crossing themes way too intimately
you're missing out
you should get the chrome extension that plays the corresponding hour of animal crossing music based on the current time
why not the shopping one
i guess i better finally sit down for an hour and watch it
this has literally been in my suggested for months now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ehnZNaNow4
to be media you just need to scan a business card
oh to be an exhibitor you have to have an actual company and shit
not if we make a game in a month
which one do you think is easier
we'd have to register as media or exhibitors to go
except for monday
lol keenan pax tickets are sold out too
like who's acting or what the song name is
amazon and google use their pro machine learning techniques to tell you stuff about the movie or show as it's playing
google play also does it i think
yeah its the best thing about prime
meaning other dota dudes
for the same dates
a lot of these places have people "eyeing" them
we have to book by the end of the week probably
this place would be super cheap
https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1980283?guests=5&adults=5&location=Seattle%2C%20WA%2C%20United%20States&check_in=2017-08-06&check_out=2017-08-12&s=5SCw1eyU
lol
the other thing though is ronald will only be there for the second half
4 people sleeping in one hotel room with 1 or 2 beds
thats porbably not acceptable either by hotel standards
a hotel could maybe be cheaper if we do it like that
yeah it's anywhere from 2-6 people
i dont care who sleeps on the bed but i mean is that considered acceptable by airbnb renting people
is that acceptable
do you think we could get a 1 bed air bnb and eveyone sleep on the floor
ok
i need to know who's buying tickets so i can sell them otherwise
anyway you guys should decide what you're doing in a couple days
i just lost a dota game very badly because i spent the whole time talking in discord
but ive seen his mom a lot
havent seen him since he graduated
i have no idea what henry looks like
it's his mom
no you remember henry herring
it probably has to be the same flight
like if you and asher bought your tickets together you woudl both get 20% off
i also think multiple people can use my 20% airline ticket discount if they buy their tickets together
my mom and her friend also might be interested in going because they wanted to hang out in seattle too so we could also room with them to make things really cheap
very likely air bnb but it wasnt decided yet because we were still unsure who was going
that will cut a lot of costs
good idea
where is it
you would have to travel
where is it
i would go to that too if i didnt have to miss many classes
when's pax
paying 100 dollars to see a billionaire is a pretty good deal
sandals and all
so you can see gabe newell in person
it would be coolest to go on monday
it's 200 instead of 100 but more people are only available for the weekend
if no one buys the finals ticket thats fine because it's way more in demand anyway
yeah
well ronald would only be there on the weekend
he got cursed
we all know what happened to keenan
i would appreciate it though if someone i knew bought my tickets so i dont have to deal with strangers
yes
thats fine too
you would have to buy it from me
you cant
the midweek is only 100 for mon-thurs
keenan would you want the midweek ticket and ronald can take the finals ticket
for the whole week or just the weekend
ripe old age of 2
to see ronald
no i think he meant he's going to california
so we would probably leave on sunday
although grand finals is on sat
that would be neat
no do you want a weekend ticket
aug 7-12
when ti happens
yeah i would have to sit at a desk but it's no different then what i'd have to do to if i was streaming from my computer
it actually doesnt look bad at all if the lighting is right
i would just need a phone stand
no i was literally wanting to do it with my phone via periscope
periscope
i want to figure out how to stream my 3ds
but there are tons of bugs
like it's technically supported
i heard the elgato streaming software doesnt work on macs
remember when you used to stream
i feel like i havent talked to you in forever
hi keenan
k
<@!125452744440938497> do you want to play dota?
hes on a team with blitz and bulba and they are playing against moonmeander and dubu and a random invoker player who just keep feeding down mid
these na pubs are so cancerous
and literally everyone on the enemy team is just feeding him
ok he started a new game to get 10k
9999 lol

10k game is going on right now
asher come watch history being made
it like they are "there" but don't actually help me fight
but it's weird when i unlock major characters in certain story cutscenes and i cant even use them because i like my older, more seasoned guys more
yeah i guess it adds a lot of replayability
why
It really makes me sad because I would have to grind a lot to unlock all the possible support conversations
In shadows of valentia you can use your whole army at all times
Ugh the main problem with awakening is they give you so many characters you want to use but you can only pick about half per battle
Should I marry my 1000 year old dragon to a child
This is bullshit chrom can't marry who I want him to
I also have a billion single player games to beat
The games I played last night sucked
Maybe I kind of don't like playing dota atm
Play some video games
Don't forget about my rules
Well good
Didn't i ask you if you had plane proof headphones and yut said yes
Man i could have been playing fire emblem for the past hour

Ronald it's past midnight why are you up so late
Woah fuck mine uses the screen as a flash
No selfies must be taken with the front camera
I don't have that luxury
It's fortune Keenan has lights in his house
Check my mom's Facebook
That's disgusting
Keenan you need to at least clean the shit off your knife
I can try taking another one
I don't see the problem Ronald
No if you repost in the morning it would be 100% fine
Yours scaring me
I'm trying to sleep
Delete that please
Sorry it's a little dark
Here's a selfie

Keenan you also still suck
Ronald you don't have any excuse now
Lol I love how somehow this ancient old man has a literal baby for a son


Use Stan Lee in a headset pls



Ronald and Asher have had the same one forever and Keenan's just sucks
It's boring
I think everyone needs to change their profile pictures
<:happyboy:230130509630406656>
You got it.
Guess what's all here
Maybe he really really likes it
I know he really likes math
Good man
He looks the same
Nah
I know that's why it's okay now
But it's a foreign floor
I'm pretty sure you're cheating on your own floor
Oh ok thats acceptable
Why would you sleep on someone else's floor
Your crazy asher
so he doesnt count either
and if ronald was a female you would
megan seems like one
lol i have a lot of platonic friends
sdfasdfasdfasdfasdfp9[;
isnt that the story
isnt the whole point of the game what would happen if the nazis won
so that pretty much rules that out
polygon doesnt have a series about doom though
anyway dont you agree
when you're just typing
i cant tell
lol
why do you have to be so condesending
im thinking ahead here
he needs to play that so he can more importantly play the next one coming out
yes
im referring to the newest wolfenstien series
they all are
thats not core bethesdy either
ronalds played dishonored right
you like nazis and bethesda
but it's bethesda
its not fallout
i do think you would like wolfenstien better than shadow of mordor
shadow of mordor is fallout with orcs
orcs
but wolfenstien is fallout with nazis
polygon just made a whole show about it
you should get wolfenstien ronald
<@!125452744440938497> want tot play dota?
i could also just give you my instance
i woudl never turn down free google cloud credits
i dont remember
look at this beautiful crystal boy
yes
this is what the inside of a titan's lung looks like if anyone was curious
well he did go vanguard first
37
<@!125452744440938497> come play
no
it's batman
i dont even have to move my hands off the keyboard
it's pretty easy to check to discord
im programming and dont want to stop
no
https://twitter.com/aeiowu/status/878000253198151680
i can in a bit
which is my new favorite
that reminds me of todays google doodle
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgSSql6MAKo

and in reality dunkey's talks and acts just like a normal guy
what if it's all just an act
"this is the best game we have ever played
video has some swearing it is not for kids :)"
literally children
both of them are children
did you watch the one where the they play grush
good times
lol 2011
perfect
emote names these days
reversed_hand_with_middle_finger_extended::skin-tone-4
when there's more than 3 games i want to play on it i will
yeah i'll have to make sure to set it up
yeah you can play with Megan and ronald
good point
if you pay for the server you can play right now
There's a fun coop game called minecraft
No
please everyone buy that game
crypt of the necrodance is $3
steam sale
TIME TO BUY NIER
This is a really interesting read
http://aeiowu.com/writing/tumbleseed/
maybe
stop cooking with your buds
yeah ronald
i need like 15 minutes
Have you?
I'd say I'm about 65%
Yeah they share a lot of similar letters
Those are the prerequisites
Anyone who wants to help has to play majora and earthbound and stardew valley
"i already know i'm going to end up trying to do all the work and giving up in frustration" other way around
That's not even the first time people have left IGN to go work at Nintendo
Lol one of IGN's lead editors and the host of their Nintendo podcast just got hired by Nintendo
that sounds just like final fantasy 15
Boi had awesome box art too
Nicalis had been on point with their switch physical releases
It's so pretty
But look at that box art
But they had the better exclusives...
I fucking hated every bit of walking in the mall and going into gamestop
Yeah but only GameStop has the key chain and pouch
Completely worth going to GameStop for this

Also check this out

I'm getting the pimp Bowser
Newer amiibos are always better designed and more detailed
I'm waiting for the new line to come out with Splatoon 2
Now idk what I'm going to do with the pink and blue clothing sheep that no one likes
I got kk slider
But who cares about the functionality
The animal crossing line frequently goes on sale because that Wii u game they were created for sucked
Yeah this 3 pack went from 24 dollars to 1 dollar
Also got Mr.
Nook but he was 3 dollars
Got these for 99 cents at best buy today

I love how every game company has a dumb game about pets or animals
Lol this Jim Ryan guy is full of BS
https://twitter.com/NintenDaan/status/877207147557335040
Sounds like a game made for children
Wow
Maybe you should use items
Maybe you are expected to grind more
It can't be that hard
Is that a kingdom heart
What is Roxas
it's more like you created a really challenging puzzle that took people 3 years to solve
i wish i could create a game that has hundreds of thousands people playing but it it takes 3 years before the first person beats it
insane
https://twitter.com/aeiowu/status/877036199541706753
if someone else did they didnt post their score online
also im looking at the online leaderboards and this is the first time someone has actually gotten that card in threes and beaten it
like world of goo and vvvvvv and bastion
and i think it's funny that all the highest rated ones werent originally mobile games
so i just learned that mobile games are rated on metacritic
yeah
im not talking about 2048 though
if you mean the game 2048 blatantly ripped off then yes
i think there's a leaderboard though
it might not be im just assuming based on his reaction
https://twitter.com/aeiowu/status/877034217250709504
that someone only just discovered now
apparently it has an ending
wow someone just beat threes for the first time
just a normal mario rpg
really good toad doesnt trigger me
only by toad
i might be too triggered
we need this

yeah anytime
"esport"
thats cool, i wish i could do that in dota but i dont have the stamina for it
at least i finally understand how to play shulk in smash now
i dont have any with better stats
i cant take cutscenes seriously when they are like this
thats not her skin it's her pants
lol
look at her pants

just look at shulk
god i made all my characters look ugly as fuck
It's offline until Keenan has a computer that can play
Dankey Kang?
thats litearlly what they are saying
joy!
joy!
joy!
thought about till i saw the not valid on PS4
it's definitely the worst emote
anytime someone uses this emote 😂 😂 😂 and especially three times in a row i lose all respect for them
i dont understand how you can like a show so  much but then be okay with skipping an episode

Use screen

screenshot our screenshot of screenshots
until metroid became a thing again
i never realized how much the mgs 1 soundtrack reminded me of metroid
yo keenan
i realized most antivirus software is bloatware and im not dumb enough when browsing the internet to warrant something more sophisticated
no it's just default
and works very well
it's super lightweight
actually windwos defender is my preferred antivirus
press alt+f4 to cast your ult at 100%
good your special is almost charged
i made a little tut

thanks
right click the windows button and click system


persistance
16 gigs 👌

this is a good day too

^ im the one who never closes shit
homework
oh strange
how old is your air
i just looked it up and the newer airs all have 8
i think it's 8
oh you mean your real pc
it's an air so i would guess 4 but it could be 8 depending on how expensive model you got
NEVERMIND
ALRIGHT
im too pro for that
i lost my wiki books when i killed myself
it will take 15 minutes
i can try restarting it though
im not getting any unusual warnings or errors
thats how many mods you have
ronald see how it's out of 189
ya
but it sucks for us who actually want to know whats going on
this was literally designed so the 6 year olds could get their mods
you're overcomplicating it
ronald you dont need to touch anything
probably
make it how ever many gigs you think you need to gig
you're teh cs major
if thats how much ram you want to dedicate
yes
is
in the main minecraft launcher make sure you have forge selected in the dropdown before clicking the green play button
just like i suspected
i dont think he needs to
and it is integrated into their discord clone for some reason
dont ask questions ronald
lol
no but keenan does
thats biology for you
help your crops growq?
what do they do
ew
thats
mods for you
thus allowing it to spread
making it more likely for you to die there again
especially if you made the corruption damage you
that would be pretty hardcore
everytime someone died that area of the world became permanently corrupted and unusable
what if though
then dont die
collecting your souls?
whats that for
thats how traps are made
do you want it exact
it's going to put you within a 10 block radius
yes
then it's working
did it at least put you in the coords you said
killing you?
can i kill you to make sure
so 232 66 866
is that x y z
also what are the coords of the spawn
have fun
are you on the ground
that i also lost the code for myself
that i made myself so it was clearly better
cactuspie 2 had the original server leaderboard
good game confirmed
the xenoblade 2 composer composered chrono trigger and cross
thats the only rule
keenan cant have creative
no why
good
wow splatoon 2 has more spectating options than overwatch
because they do these weird ass intros for each team
oh you mean the esports stuff
what do you mean why
<@!155893986605793281> https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/874740731436556288

I love how 6 years into the 3ds lifecycle we get it's best year
<@155893986605793281> superstar saga announced
i need to leave soon
for a bit
theres still two more games to be announced
?
yeah i can see
they are really selling me on xenoblade with this titan premise
xenoblade 2
you cant even see the floor
jesus look at the stream
real live tactics
fire emblem warriors actually has tactics
hey guess what
but dont feel like installing software for that
i would actually
because twitch installed one for me
i think im running two different clients
i havent explored the new client enough to know how it works
i dont have any instructions
also you probably didnt actually uninstall everything
is she using a mac
because twitch automatically installed the launcher and everything for me
and install the mods
i think she should just go directly to twitch

they have changed the launcher since the last time we played
you just need to go to minecraft.net and download the latest launcher
MARIO RABIDS WHICH MY NEW FAVORITE HAPPY DEV
AMIIBO
this metroid is extremely cinematic for a 2d game
tropical freeze 2?!?!?!?!?
it doesnt worry me at all it just makes me wonder what the hell retro is doing
prime 4 isnt being developed by retro but it has the same producer as the other prime games
first pkemon for home console
what if also means hardcore
thats more standard?
core as in completely new rpg experience?
core as in gen 8?
what the hell does that mean
i also cant get over "core rpg" for pokemon
this 2d metroid game is genius though because it's going to get so many 3ds owners into the series in time for prime 4
and mustache

nvm it's not that high res
hold on
pretty good timing sega
it wasnt on the stream it was just quietly released on youtube
mario possesing a real human like it's no big deal
not t
there was also a new sonic forces trailer
hey

this year

i am honestly in such disbelief
what happened to wii music 2
who took my nintendo
what are they doing
holy fuck



wtf
"evil wedding planning firm"
look at those bullet bills just come out of the wall
the transitions
indeed
so if you want to make a knockoff you have to collect planets or some shit
but they used it instead
because thats the only way you could make a mario knockoff
genius
instead of stars it's moons
i just realized
move over yooka laylee
i still cant get over the fact that there's a fucking realistic dinosaur in the logo
thatssome good game design
lol that face splat
its a good concert
he just did
THE MUSIC!@#!@#
ok bill trinen said to absolutely tune into the first two segments of treehouse
is a fucking genius
koizuma
and then mario popped out
i love how they showed a dinosaur and everyone thought it was monster hunter
create
they
did
what
wtf WAS THAT DINOSUAR
cross platform doesnt include ps4
WHERES MARIO
they doing duplicates
this was announced at the beginning
they just do treehouse
they never do
what do you mean
holy shit i can get a goron amiibo!
lol
"Oh?
when did this master sword get in my hand?"
nintendo is really simplifying the brand here
2018
"Yoshi"
just say the name
they dont even need any game
they did the thing
as:DLFJQEW$(ORTOUI3qw
HOLASDGFKJ
was he canceled
wheres mario
"core rpg"
yeah because he couldnt actually go to nintendo hq
lol
lol great title
2018
"Kirby"
it's more anime
it is
yes
xenoblade
lol
holy fuck
hold me
you should take a picture of them and post it on /r/programmerhumor
lol
at your work?
my favorite thing about that sub is how everyone spend time programming jokes
yeah
cant wait to cringe when they show the voice chat app
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM45NsEzlro
https://www.twitch.tv/nintendo
yes
maybe after the direct it will be easier
i knew this would be a problem
im having a real hard time focusing on the work i need to get done
good
we are all going to live together in one big happy city where keenan and asher do all the work and ronald and i just play occasionally and fuck around
i would also need help
doesnt it just mean you can get his position
leaving gameworld?
but then later we can become more independent
i think we should live near each other and maybe even share resources at the start just to get situated in the whole mod situation
i dont want to handle these mods all by myself
can i live with someone this time
we want to make sure we have an interesting spawn
remember we have to scout the world first

SERVER

IP: 35.190.152.3  
Version: 1.10.2 
Modpack: https://www.feed-the-beast.com/projects/ftb-beyond 
Game: Minecraft
Media genre: video game
this is too much.
im logging off

this is too much.
web browser discord?
i know but how are you on discord then
buty you're on your laptop right?
i am still downloading on my one
you can try logging on if you have the client ready
anyway ftb is lookin more promising since i fixed the port problem
basically i was a sheep
because the last time i was trying it there was an error
but the real test now is if ftb will work on server
but i only used certain steps from the tutorial since there were parts i had already done
if i just did it on my own intuition it wouldnt have messed up
the google tutorial ended up screwing me
im installing ftb on my personal client now to test
wel maybe only two very's
im very very very dumb
keenan.............................................................................
i be doing
mega man
but nope it's going to be on the vive
i thought it was a joke too
mario kart is headed to vr in japan
wtf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwze-Hsu3eo
yeah i like how many different color options and styles they have
marioariaorio
lol
yeah and Ancel is obviously very passionate about his work
but it's just the universe i think most people are interested in
and looks completely different gameplay wise
the new game is a prequel apparently
i would think it would be hard to find
oh interesting
it's one of those cult hits that didnt sell well
thats probably way cheaper than you can get used
10
it's on steam
good deal
yes
neither you have too many games right now and there will just be more after today
for 3ds?
https://i.imgur.com/cYIUzqy.jpg
People are worried it's going to be more of a spin-off from the main series that appeals more to the western audience
So the new monster hunter is being developed by an American studio
Lol even me
https://twitter.com/MrKingFunk/status/874611252810719232
the possibilites also seem there for fucking with your co-op partners
it has the everything i think you'd want to do in a pirate game plus a cartoonish sense of realism
i just watched the polygon sea of thieves gameplay and it looks genuinely fun

or just the first one
all of them?
i cant which game specifically this is a remaster of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keI83oLw-_4
with a full symphonic soundtrack remaster
well actually just complete remaster of age of empires
new age of empires
YOULL NEVER GUESS
HOLY HSJIOT

Lol
Ok
The people who made arma just announced a minecraft-like sandbox game that looks very good
With Ted from Rare
They are talking if sea of thieves now
I thought this was the beginnings of your comic career
I thought it was by you at first
Pretty soon you'll be a real comic book
Almost there
You know what that means.
The player unknown battlegrounds guy is wearing an attari shirt
Because it's all just one big ad
Lol literally no one is clapping during this Intel segment
i need to look into tekkit for that stuff
the problem is that i think they might have different compatibilities  on a server
ok send it to me
ye

he's a well known esports guy
i really like the host of the pc gaming show

he did a lot of the writing for nier

<@!155893986605793281> <@!125452744440938497> you guys should follow this guy
It will be physically excruciating
Or even 1.10 but it will be hard for me
I'm fine with 1.11
Which is why i have never used them.
Since I always play on snapshots.
You know outdated things are my pet peeve
😲
Lol
Also why is that even an emote
I need to do some other things first
Maybe
I think that will be indies
PC gaming conference is at 1
Today at 4
Most powerful Minecraft server ever created
Like i said
I have to do a lot of research

maybe
why
since he has that frog skin
it's perfect

it buffers too much
i gave up on twitch
me too
me too
you should join me
no im fixing twitch
im trying to fix twitch on my computer
wait how long is the episode?
when did you start it
you need to be paying attention
smb2 in 5 minutes
hey keenan
yeah he seems to have general experience in most things except for the highly technical stuff like dota and programming
nicalis is releasing an anime 2d fighter that has the same animator as sf2
and then your perceptions are already swayed
ronald that wouldnt work because i already created this in which i tried to incorporate feedback of others
ronald the only music i dont know anything about is music made in the last 100 years that's not video game music
because ronald has made more churches in minecraft than you asher
di phi
thats like clubs
i would have to use * i think if i just wanted contains
it has to be a literal match
those are in parenthesis so it doesnt count
dumb list making is very useful skill
lol
lower score the better right
4k
6 teraflops
this will be the most advanced minecraft server i've ever produced
dont worry it's going to take me a week to set it up
1 sex = 5 charisma
we would have to make a conversion
lol if only dnd stats were like this
you'll have to make a different list for rankings of betterness
it's more
it's not better
it was a revolution in the gaming industry
yet someone made a game where they ate the banana without peeling it first
and you peel it
it's a fruit
theres this thing called a banana
you see
if you need anyone to explain all the new memes let me know
what, e3?
i found this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doETbIsWibw it has the same setting
yeah i dont know what they were filming in that video
yeah where
because nick sounds like he's talking to a stream in that banana video
does polygon have a show similar to what ign is doing where they discuss the news before and after the conferences
it's a little dissappointing to hear they are making this when they dont have the original people
i would say this is the perfect game for rare to make if they still had all their original people
but ive definitely seen a cutscene before of dk peeling a banana
unpeeled you're right
You would think they know a little about bananas
That game is made by Rare
You know what's even funnier
Professionals.
I laughed for like 5 minutes

yeah i think for your purposes it's fine to get a cheap mountain bike
depends if they are paved or not
you waste a lot of energy
i guess but i wouldnt get a mountain bike if you arent riding off road
i only know what standard road bike size looks like
wheel sizes are complicated because they either go by tire size or tube size or actual wheel frame size
i dont know the number i only know visually
whatever the standard is for big grownup adult boys

new mmorpg that looks epic
lol
dragon ball fighterZ was the best announcment and they only spent 1 minute on it
this has really cool animation
oh dragon ball fighters
i wonder what it is
phil spencer just mentioned a japanese game

the is the best news of the press conference
and 4k
bascially just shaders
minecraft is getting new greaphics
WTF
crossplay with all consoles and mobile and pc
MINECRAFT NEWS
ok well at least send it after the press conference
you need to tweet nick as well
they can
lower the size of the zoomed out one
you only need four images
but it's still another shooter
thats impressive
they just got pubg exclusivity
they even did the slow mo bow stuff when you jump off of things
this game is literally zelda
holy shit
lol
i cant unsee it
tweet it to him after the e3 stuff dies down
lol
assassins creed looks cool
42 games will be shown and 22 will be console exclusive (which means also on pc lol)
wow this has so much power you can literally play real life
what a GAMES conference
wow
and theres a brand new porsche sports car
it just flipped open
this is a cool stage
oh they are driving a car on stage
fantastic i always wanted another car game
yes
oh this is cars
oh finally games
and marketing speak
all the same buzzwords
to be honest this sounds *exactly* like an apple press conference
yes
https://twitter.com/vgdunkey/status/874010445560066048
ive never felt so much power before
wow i can just feel the power the power sitting here
it's called xbox one x
i wonder how many teraflops it took to make that
looks sick
i have to give microsoft credit for their dope ass stage and animations though
spirit tracks was amazing at that
ds music isn't bad if you have headphones
hey
neat
well L=A would be ideal but they dont have the technology to do that yet
i actuaaly had a dream that fire emblem switch could be played enitrely with the touch screen so you dont even have to attach the joycons
jesus
wtf t text bubble covers up her butt
classes probably get a little more complex than that
haha
so basically dota but with my favorite final fantasy character final fantasy
im impressed but im tired of hearing about it
it genuinely seems like they did a good job, 60fps full resolution in each mode and all the features of the other versions of the other games except the campaign
good on ea for making a good port but i literally dont give a shit
literally half the posts on the switch subreddit are about how good the port of fifa 18 is and it's super annoying
and it's going to get so much better
nick already has three tweets about the shirts
best of luck to them
i think if they try again in ayear it will be much more successful
they were too ambitious going into a campaign like that without any gameplay
it's still not going to get funded
yup
but it's still not real gameplay
yeah i think they realized no one is oging to back their kickstarter if they have zero gameplay
i cant wait for nick robinson's tweets during
its going to be so fun
i cant wait to watch this press conference though
botw
lol https://twitter.com/britishgaming/status/873988382212444160
you have to get that shirt
omg
i didnt think so
but keenan did you just witness the most powerful console ever?
look at all their shirts
lol this image is so funny https://twitter.com/albertpenello/status/873986403071406080
so i'll have to work on that
though it might also be because it's third party
now i can firmly hold each controller in my hand and say with confidence that the xbox one's is the the worst
pretty much everything that people thought was negative
yeah they are fixing everything about it
i just got the ps4 controller because it was on sale and it's sexy as fuck
i want to play a 3 player game on my pc and hand everyone a controller from a different console
no ive had the xbox one for a while
the gang is all here

art
or general handyness
science olympiad type stuff
we can have a category for building stuff/crafting/project things
yeah we pretty much have all of life covered here
ronald you are ahead of me because you have probably at least seen a cigarette in real life before
"nicest" is not something we spend time doing

yeah you should go on jeopardy
i dont mean to be offensive but i do think you pick up a lot of random things from classes
just because i think being in school helps with that
i went ahead and put you ahead on trivia
is that a side effect of the porn differential
enjoyment doesnt really factor into it
or time spent doing
since this is more of a level of experience thing
in that case then ronald would be ahead
but i thought ronald doesnt do it since he cant ever get high
asher
keenan i dont know im really trying to stop
yeah decycles definitely counts towards travel
but just inside the u.s.
you have to realize ive been able to fly for free my whole life
and every summer i go to at least two other places besides AZ
before college and highschool i traveled all the time
AZ is just the most frequent
ive been to almost every state
he's probably been to more unique places
yeah i think keenan coudl win in travel
obviouslly i only really know the last like 5-6 years
as far as i know
i was considering lifetime
the rest is really hard to rank
the only definite thing about travel is that asher is last
you should have a cooking war
i just you know you both cook more than me and asher
ronald
idk couldnt decide
ronald all of those are the same place
and it's pretty consistent every year
i go on a ton of small trips throughout the year
it was ahrd to determine between me and you
yeah you're definitely more than ronald
i think i meant to put that
yeah you might be above asher
so pop culture
i think it depends too much what the trivia is about
im just good or bad at everything
ronald is very well rounded
yeah see
i will put in formulas to count
im either first or last in everything
thanks for making me google cunnilingus
yeah anytime i could be listening to a podcast it's probably music instead
ah ok
i do listen to probably more podcasts than ronald and maybe asher
you could list podcasts though
yeah its not very interesting to rank websites i think
like i know me and ronald use reddit the most and you and asher use tumblr the most
but thats too hard to determine
i thought about listing all the internet websites too
is accurate
i dont play chess but i play the japanese anime version
lol ronald higher than asher in pokemon even though he owns two of the games
thats what i considered as reading
i put books
because i dont count biking as working out
i only knew ronald does it
i just didnt know about you guys
we can rank exercising too
fine fix it
but thats more music
i figured he was since he had a hatsune miku
i wasnt sure
ok thanks for the clarification
this is what i did
ronald i couldnt sleep all night
probably
i agree with him
im pretty sure im behind asher
i know way more about classical and stuff
i kind of grouped all kinds of music together
idk
i also played music for a very long time
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RXjCu2yTdQ10I9GkNJ04NgfVAfKcWNLww6Xao0-ww7A/edit?usp=sharing
warning: it's pretty stupid
except this time at 5 am
i made another thing last night
that reminds me
idk
i am really tempted to buy this
the creep shots of miyamoto and the wild speculation based of nintendo employee's shirts
this is my favorite part
lol it begins https://twitter.com/SteveMBowling/status/873965415373848576
there's an oval spot on the far right of the right button that already looks like toad's hat
i know nick also loves these high res mario shots
then tweet it at nick and patrick and they will retweet
make an album with a series of images zooming in on the button until at the end the good toad is revealed
hl3
the bottome definitely is
and seams forming his glove
he even has seams where his pants zippers would be
this is way too detailed
i also just realized mario has no neck
i think this is a high res render of the actual model so if you were to stand real close to the camera in game you could maybe see his hair
open this in browser and zoom in
just a reminder: http://cdn4.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/NintendoSwitch_SuperMarioOdyssey_character_01_png_jpgcopy.jpg
i can see it
they are genius to tap into that market when no VC exists for a while
yeah that company publishing all these neo geo games on the switch is the real mvp
lol
oh nice it's co-op
did you get on the switch?
that sounds like a pacman game
also most of the actual gameplay and stuff will happen throughout the day on tuesday and wednesday
you can at least play it at work
i like the ui as you scroll
nintendo has a sexy e3 website https://e3.nintendo.com/
9 am PT
yeah it does
it will keep going the whole day but i have class at 4 and you probably have work
it starts at noon on tuesday
what time?
but we can still call
but anyway thats too late to hang sorry
yeah different websites were sawying different things but im going to trust the most recent
I guess Bethesda is midnight now

In Japan
I can imagine every Japanese game developer attending the launch parties of every other major game
They probably attend the same parties
Lol I bet he hangs with kojima more than the solid snake guy
The interviewers are just Nintendo employees so they are like old buddies
Also if he has the translator covers it up
No he hasn't lost it yet
That guy literally always wears a Mario shirt
https://www.instagram.com/p/BVNHTbfBISI/
Yeah that would probably be at sony
Ah ok
At least EA's was
It's more like a cringe fest
I am
But if I do then yeah
I have an assignment due at midnight i need to get that done
Perhaps
Why wouldn't he also want to watch Bethesda
Twin peaks only takes like 40 min right
That's perfect
1am - Devolver Digital
5 - Microsoft
8 - Reggie appears on Geoff Keighley's show
10 - Bethesda
You gotta watch them so you understand the memes
I will also call for the ones today if you are around
Good we should call
Are you working on Tuesday
But still all the stages and music from all the Nintendo games
So it's just them
But ice climbers are the only characters the switch can handle
What I'd they made smash
People also think pikmin 4 is very likely but I'm in doubt because of pikmin 3ds
Anything he does is brilliant
Only one of those is going to happen at e3
There's only 3 games I'm extremely hyped for Odyssey, Fire emblem 2018, and animal crossing switch
I think decent for mobile title
Yes
But not sure that they would announce it at e3 because Nintendo is slowly moving away from big e3 announcements
I also think it's about time for a new dk
It just didn't seem like 2017 game to me
I think it might be slotted for that but we literally haven't heard anything about it since January
Because I don't even know if that's supposed to come out in 2017
The only real unlikely things are smt, octopath, and retro studios
It probably couldn't even be done by one person who doesn't work at Nintendo
That would take a lot of work
True mother 3 has a lot of text
It's almost time for a new one
It's been like 2-3 years since they localized mother 1
Mother 3 isnt bonkers
That would be funny
These were very well thought out by me at 3 am so I hope you like
This is so you all can see how right I was in a couple days

E3 2017 PREDICTIONS

General: Nintendo seems more focused on marketing their existing games this year rather than announcing new ones.
For that reason I expect little surprises but if we get a ton of Mario info and I can get some taste of the new Xenoblade soundtrack I will be a very happy boy.

that was pretty creative
<@!155893986605793281> this is relevant https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IptvSQY9Qa8

lol
thast not many times
6 times
10 hrs of that will cover any trip
ive been listening to the song from this cutscene forever and i only just now realized it was from fire emblem https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBFWOEdxd_c
The only thing that sucks is that I can't unlock the support conversations for everyone unless I do a ton of grinding
This is like stardew valley but I can matchmake with everyone
I also found the perfect wife for my boy Frederick who my favorite way too dedicated knight
YESS I FOUND THE PERFECT WIFE FOR CHROM
https://youtu.be/UAdzUsEqbDg
Grandparents again?
Where you going?
including offline singlyplayer campaign
30 minutes of star wars
you can only play in split screen
that's really interesting to see in this era of games
wow they just announced a co-op only story-based game by the guy who made brothers a tale of two sons

things get really akward when they start struggling to read off the teleprompter
the best part of this is seeing nick robinson's tweets come in live making fun of everything
except the difference is that their esports are actually just real sports but digital
ea is emphasizing esports too
everyone is just reading terribly scripted statements
oh look another sports game with terrible facial animations
you're just going to miss goty
guys what if there's a new sims
is anyone going to watch ea with me
idk when the movie comes out
it came out yesterday
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SteF9aZ6I-w
lol
little dunkey
https://imgur.com/OjxCqTC
time to watch all these again https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu1xFdz2wZQ
that reminds me
color splash looked so good
jesus
with a fully orchestrated soundtrack
thousand year door in the same graphical style as color splash
can you imagine
but god
they have to stop making all these new IPs when they could just remaster metroid and people would love them forever
and especially gamecube ones that arent on VC
there are so many games from the n64 gamecube era that i never played
i would love that
it seems plausible though dont you think
also it's called DX
this promo image has new characters
http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/04/rumour_mario_and_luigi_superstar_saga_dx_partnering_up_for_3ds_eshop
I dont know why everyone forgot about this
https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/1/15500040/mario-and-luigi-superstar-saga-dx-nintendo-3ds
mother 3 is just a hunch because it seems about time
it had art assets and everything
but i remember a couple months ago there was a really convincing leak about a superstar saga remake for 3ds
yeah no one has been talking about it
and also a remake of superstar saga
so also keenan i think it's really likely mother 3 localization will be announced at e3
to cash in on the serious game news podcast business every other journal has been doing for years
did you see that polygon just today started a serious podcast
they parody general gaming stuff too
there needs to be more stuff like this in the gaming industry
https://twitter.com/PorygonNews
or that no one really wants to play anyway
but these are the games that frequently go on sale on psn or steam
or only have an xbox one as their only console
yeah it's really great for people who dont have access to a pc
and the rest are games that i dont want to own
hell i already own half of these
the only bad thing about the xbox game pass is that most of the games with the exception of halo are things that you can get really cheap on steam or humble
it's basically what nintendo is going to be doing with it's online
as long as you are still paying your subscription
so there's no difference from actually owning them
well the main reason it's superior is that the games are downloaded instead of streamed
that doesnt make any sense to me
i mean cant you just buy those in psn normally
yeah but you're already paying 10 dollars a month for all these games, there's no reason to buy them by itself
thats the whole point of the game pass
but you dont have to
what do you mean
plus i think you dont even need an xbox to use it (?) just a pc
because it's really cheap and unlike anything else offered at the moment
i think their netflix style service could be really good
but you do have a point
https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/xbox-unleashed-our-deep-dive-study-of-how-millions-use-xbox-live/
but in practice they dont use it
consumers always say they want backwards compatibility
they went very in depth on their process and how they got all the data
read it
it is very true
that study i linked revealed like 2% of xbox live users play 360 games on their xbox one
no one uses xbox backwards compatibility
but there's like a 0% chance they will open it up like that
but theoretically a 500-600 dollar 4k capable console that can play any pc game as well would sell really well
but then at that point you sacrifice any software optimizations microsoft could make
they best thing they could do is allow steam or something on it
it will only sell if it has games
i dont think any of this matters though
but this thing still has way better specs
but just with more games and with more at native 4k
i think the scorpio could manage at least that
the ps4 pro has very few games that can actually get true 4k at 30fps
no i still think it could hit 30 fps in 4k
sshh
in 60fps
but it might run their highly optimized first party ones at 4k
no
unless it can run every pc game, it's useless in my mind
still
the reason they can price something that can run forza at 60fps 4k so low is because they are probaly selling at a loss and have done a ton of software hardware optimizations
or even if it costs 600
because if it costs 500, you definitely cant build a 4k gaming pc for 500
yeah i think it will  be the cheapest way to enthusiast graphics
i actually think microsoft can optimize their hardware and software in a way that makes the scorpio cheaper than an equivalently speced gaming pc
i think the scorpio has some market for people who want to play games in 4k but dont want to build a pc
sounds fun.
especially if your name is microsoft
how do you even have a conference that long
microsoft's is fucking 90 minutes
i hope ea's isnt more than an hour
i mainly just want to see this star wards game
yea i want someone to talk to otherwise i will get bored
yeah it's at 3
is anyone going to watch ea press conference with me
Right
so when we chat it just becomes a ladder of helixes
yours should just be helix but mirrored in the other direction
im most excited for e3 so i can find something new to change my profile picture too
yeah unfortunately by the time it gets to your birthday all the cool games are already old news and no one plays them anymore
it's like my birthday was chosen to be the ideal time to release games
as it is every year
that friday right before my birthday is going to be a crazy day
and porbbaly mario too
shit that comes out the same day as pokemon
this is awesome

"Their website is one of the most well-designed, user-friendly, websites I've ever seen!!!
I set it to my homepage and check it for the latest games every day! 💯 👌 💯 ☑ !!
5 stars!"
Hey everyone, guess what?
IT IS TRADE TUESDAY!!
I'm starting to think this happens every week...🤔
👍
These games are WANTED dead or...actually just alive.
It's hard to enjoy broken games.
except for that one guy who actually wrote a helpful review
its also only 5 stars or 1 star
i like the one guy at the top who gave 3 stars but actually wrote a thoughtful review
Worst game place ever!
I think u all r some over priced a.
Holes.
N ripping people off.
Smh.
Given people not even $5 for a game then trying to sell it for 34.99 fyi people u can get most of the games they r selling for under $10 online. 😉 I laughed at the guys in bedford.
Glad u all r ok to rip people off that bad.
no toad
keenan you know why gameworld only has 3.6/5 stars on facebook
lets play
give me an hour to finish this aassignment
because they both have red hair and have the same voice
you know why
thats literally the same as this
Lol I think my network messed up
On gameworld's Facebook, can you post "Are you excited to hear more about the brand new Mario game Mario Odyssey at e3 next week?" and put a picture of the good toad

its still store credit
tell him to become a member and he can do that used games
gameworld is so good that your customers arent even aware of the competition
so it's definitely possible
well there are only two other (first party) notable 3ds games this year
http://www.perfectly-nintendo.com/ever-oasis-4th-blog-post-from-koichi-ishii-oasis-part-2-overview-trailer/


theres so much new ever oasis concept art and it's awesome


they are kind of right but their booth does take up half of the show floor...
lol
i should really unfollow gamestop on twitter:
im so excited to play nier now so i can hear my favorite dudes again
both 8-4
and i just realized why
theres so much overlap between the nier automata voice actors and the shadows of valentia ones
and the person who voiced celica also voiced futaba
ooh the same guy who voiced alm voiced 9s
bravely default, smt, persona, fire emblem, ff, nier, league of legends
lol liam obrien has played a role in pretty much every jrpg
i think i would rather just want to watch all the voice actors for my favorite games and movies do their voices
yeah ethan was telling me about him
theres my boy who voices Chrom
im sure they know how to do lots of acting
have a bunch of famous voice actors play dnd
it seems like a really cool idea though
or listened
have you ever watched critical role?
hes going to become a dm for that group you used to dm for
my brother has also spent the last several days watching archives of critical role
but idk
but i guess 5 is not going to suck
but says 4 sucks
hes played 3 a lot
my brother is really looking forward to it
and then smeared it all over the canvas with their hands
yours is just what would happen if a toddler ate a bunch of paint and then shit it out
art would be my profile pic
plus it's just ugly
i keep thinking im talking to my brother
can you change your profile pic it really bothers me
ok
i could see it gettinga  remake but i think its the type of game to be updated forever instead of getting a sequel
but it could take a while to port since it's an unreal 3 game and switch only supports unreal 4 officially
people want that game on switch so much
probably
lol like i said they fixed everything people complained about
is that this "Added: A shot-meter was added to help finding the perfect timing for shots, dunks etc."
what do you mean
yup thats what you do with one fof the worst video games of all time
lol "Shaq Fu was met with mixed responses from critics upon release, though it has since come to be considered one of the worst video games of all time.
A sequel, Shaq Fu: A Legend Reborn, is in development."
but keenan it sucked really bad
looks like a crazy game
the trailer just confused me
is shaq the only playable character
is shaq fu a fighting game
do you play as one dude or 5 dudes
wait
he's going to be my main
i had a teacher who would use him as an example in every coding assignment
he's my favorite one
omg they added Larry Bird
you could battle him in playgrounds right
looks like they have different skins too
Added: 5 new versions of Shaquille O´Neal in various teams from his career (Boston Celtics, Miami Heat, Phoenix Suns, Cleveland Cavaliers, Orlando Magic)
i wonder how they made them that fast
wow they also added 15 new heroes in this update
https://steamcommunity.com/games/545270/announcements/detail/1271550628451977592
lol that was one of the things to be fixed
lol that was one of the things to be fixed
its just like overwatch
they made many lovable ones
nba took a lot of time creating all of these characters
keenan the whole point is to discover new boys
or maybe go by numbers instead if they have those
cant you just pick your favorite color ones
with different color jerseys
arent they all like different colors
gotta collect em all
they are just all original intellictual property created by the team at nba
they have no association whatsoever to real people
they all have different lore and personalities
you basically treat them like pokemon
they are each a unique new character
i think you just have to treat it like any other game where you collect characters
like what's happening with yookalaylee
i heard that the update thats coming out for all systems basically fixes everything negative about the game
i want to play it with you next time i see you
ia it good
do they even have any multiplayer games
it would be blizzard
sony doesnt have any esports
there's a clear season and off-season
the problem with real sports is they only have one big tournament a year
so if the invitationals get enough viewership we could see more
and they arent going to sponsor teams or players unless ther are tournaments with lots of viewership
but its not going to be really big until we start seeing real esport organizations start sponsoring teams for these games
yeah they are slowly getting into with their three invitationals at e3
thast basically what blizzard did to make overwatch an esport overnight
all they need to do is host tournaments with large prize pools or pay third party tournament organizers to do that
but with new donk city
it wouldve been like an amusement park
we shouldve gone to e3
https://twitter.com/Seedy87/status/873224629221031937
they have so much ip sitting there that could be made into esports if they just let it
Nintendo could easily become as big as Valve or Blizzard in the esports scene if they started officially sponsoring melee tournaments and tournaments for their other games
*We don't give a shit about melee
Nintendo Esports*
Nintendo Esports Initiative https://twitter.com/NintendoVS
the switch version just got a big update too
mr shifty is good
but i know it's great
i havent gotten shantae yet but only because i have too much else to play right now
you should
so good on them
yeah basically it was a decent release but they promised online multiplayer within a few days and instead it took weeks
"We are still working with our partners to determine exactly how NBA Playgrounds players will receive their free copy of Shaq Fu when it releases this Fall, but if you bought or buy in to NBA Playgrounds before the patch hits, you’re getting a free copy of Shaq Fu.
Why?
Like we said at the beginning, we love our players and we’re always going to work to do right by them."
https://www.polygon.com/2017/6/3/15735442/shaq-fu-yo-we-dont-got-nuttin-ta-prove
yeah i think the update comes out next week
you get a free copy of the new one if you buy nba playgrounds before the update that fixes everything
best marketing slogan ever
BETTER.
THAN.
THE OLD ONE.
are you going to play with us
its hard if you dont have a four stack all collaborating
i think troll would be really good against the wolf boss

😢
"I wouldn't suggest Lina."
also <@!127535721857679362> you should find a way to play this dota 2 campaign with us
<@!125452744440938497> AAAASSHEEEER
Don't worry I have other games to play
DIABLO
You know what this means
https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/872920539316199424
it's pretty long but they timestamp everything and i think you really like it
keenan you should really listen to the 8-4 podcast http://8-4.jp/blog/
because it's one of the only games miyamoto has confirmed he's working on
i always forget
dude pikmin 4 has a real chance of being announced
that would certainly be easier to implement
yeah i could probably use command blocks
yeah you would probably need to tweak the settings of a combination of existing mods
because it seems to specific to exist already
^ this sounds like a mod that i would have to make myself
what if we did it so we made a premade seed and blocked off areas
and then made it so the only way to get into the next grid was to pay a crazy amount of resources
so it kept land we havent touched yet in good condition but also gives incentive to rape the current land
it would have been cool to see some sort of story mode with all the interesting characters
at least arms nails the gameplay
lol
also doesnt it have a really shitty dlc model
i dont really understand why its not a game that interests you though
yeah
which is crazy that the arms reviewer for polygon compared arm's grand prix to injustice
not a high bar
i was just going to say
some of the dialogue in this video i wasnt sure was real or want edited in by dunkey somehow
except you never do
anyway https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSYWIh7ajR4
you never know there could have been some obscure snes guitar hero
because otherwise it would have just been mediocre
i just needed to be sure that it was a well crafted joke
lol

its not like his normal game rant
lol the tone of his voice is very telling
and then this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duPynkGEFGI
becahse he has this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u4PCz_Q4jw
which one?
dunkey video
the campaign does not look good
the reviewer just compared it to injustice 2 which he gave a 9
i read the polygon review
and 215 on arma 2
127 hours in arma III
jesus
keenan i believe it's referred to as "art"
almost enough for a whole team
which has 3 members btw
for the official DotA 2 team "Unborn Meta"
thats the logo

And more vibrancy
The colors actually repesent their names
Finally Minecraft gets some blocks with a real color palette https://youtu.be/k2dQuIIUT-o
Thanks.
how old are the games that they are remakes of
man Atlus is releasing a bunch of 3ds rpgs in rapid succession
http://store.steampowered.com/app/583470/The_End_Is_Nigh/
it has to be a lot
you cant blame them when they have data like this
lol and i remember all the shit microsoft got when they announce the xbox one without backwards compatibility initially
"The second-most surprising high-level result from our Xbox usage sample is just how unpopular Xbox 360 backward compatibility is in actual practice (Fig.
1).
Playing games from the previous console accounts for under two percent of total Xbox One usage in our sample.
For context, that means the hundreds of backward compatible Xbox 360 games combine to represent less than half of the play time that a game like Grand Theft Auto V manages on its own."
high quality coding
those fuckers were probably doing it wrong
this is like my dream job
it's really cool reading about how Ars extracted and parsed all the data
but that's not terribly surprising
all the most owned steam games are valve games and civ 5
they did it for steam in 2014 but steam has changed a lot since then https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/04/introducing-steam-gauge-ars-reveals-steams-most-popular-games/
but this is an awesome article i want to see a similar thing for the other platforms
or at least the games people are using it to play aren't very diverse
this is not a very diverse library
practically it doesnt
that's crazy
and the top 12 games (8 of which are shooters) make up 50% of all xbox one game playtime
most of these games are third or first person shooters https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Xbox-Gauge-New-3.001new.jpg

https://www.amazon.com/Official-Soundtrack-Valve-Studio-Orchestra/dp/B071F3X1M6/ref=tmm_acd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=


i dont think you understand cloud pokemon
nah we got new games
ywea
Shadows of valentia
the sov title screen track makes me extremely sentimental
they are all pretty cool
perhaps but they still design all the characters and stuff
too muc FE
but now i know why there havent been any wario wares
and the first two metroids
paper mario, fire emblem, and warior ware
intelligent systems is amazing
god
no one judges her
it's why i also wish i knew japanese so i can see how much games change
because it needs to make sense in the specific culture
it involves a lot rewriting too
yeah and i think they can have more vulgar dialogue than normally noa would allow
cult game followings are weird
this is why so many people have played the original fire emblem gaiden before sov even though it only came out in japan
oh wtf its like 20 dollars
arent those expensive
it will be faster to wait until it's localized
thats going to take a while since you need to learn japanese first
i really want that game
yeah
i mean thats practically the only ip they have left
i dont see them announcing smash though because then no one will buy arms
takes a lot of really specific technology
the wii was the last nintendo console capable of handling the icies
oh right
if they actually do a port of smash 4 all they really need to add is ice climbers and a new singleplayer campaign
metroid at e3 confirmed
that practically only leaves metroid
zelda wont be there
pokemon wont be there
arms and splatoon wont really be at e3 except for their tournaments
so they cranked one out last weekend
it's halfway through the year and they almost forgot
"hey guys can we announce a new pokemon real quick"
gamefreak probably gave nintendo that much notice
even if it means just a week before
sticking to it i guess
it's crazy how they never announce pokemon games at e3
no more colors left
already used the 6 primary ones, red blue green yellow black white
yeah because they ran out of colors
but pls no ranger
ok dungeon is ok
it cant be a spinoff, Masuda retweeted it like 20 times
????
stars or space and time?
the big question is
thats in less than 24 hours

<@!127535721857679362> we can play dota at any time
<@!127535721857679362> you ready?
One sec
Sorry Asher for some reason I didn't notice your message
<@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362> why arent my dota boys online
who i despise
also people keep thinking im the smash player
im just bored of it
what should i change it to
also i need to change my dota name
<@!125452744440938497> you ready?
ok
Although they called him a perv so that was a little mean
That video even had a <:armboy:307590740496875531> cameo

@Big
if any of <@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362> want to play dota let me know
We were talking about why there aren't more crossover games and I just remembered that a fire emblem/smt crossover exists
it sounds like you need an io player
damn
in your favor?
how was your dota game ronald
sky
i am
wow you're just going to play dota without me
Good idea
<@125452744440938497> <@127535721857679362> are we playing dota?
It's insane how fire emblem makes you fight armies way higher level than you and you have to do it so that you don't lose a single unit
I'm a tactical genius
But not the first?
I remember people thought the sequel was underwhelming when it came out​
Disney's Epic Mickey
Yiu know what I want to play
*key* mechanics
Get it
You're probably ignoring all the key mechanics
<@155893986605793281> " In one of the prototypes seen earlier in development, one source recalled a hulky Donkey Kong themed rabbid serving as one of the first boss encounters.
The rabbid has access to a pile of bananas that it can use to replenish its health.
Players are required to first cut off his food supply to prevent him from recovering before they can do some real damage.
The DK rabbid apparently will dab periodically if it lands an attack correctly (a possible reference to DK’s dab from Mario Kart 8).
Once the boss is defeated, one member of the player’s party, a rabbid cosplaying as Princess Peach, takes out a smart phone and nabs a selfie with the DK Rabbid as it collapses."
like what happened in lost
it actually did he just took out his laptop and started playing in the flames
I probably you too
sleep
important stuff
thats fine
<@!125452744440938497> you playing?
it means he does not know female
but is there an official one
there are a lot of covers
is there no english version of the mimikyo song
so many great designs
pokemon are genius in everyway
god
the real question though is how the fuck does this magikarp song have more views in 2 weeks than the slowpoke song in 2 years
sorry that just makes whoever wrote the song even noobier
this is going on the playlist
lv 25 which noob wrote this song
the lyrics are great
better in a more worse way if you know what i mean
i mean the duck song is terrible too this is better though
this is like the duck song but way better
it's new enough for me to not have seen it yet
oh i just dont think its that old
why was it just uploaded 2 weeks ago
i need to get off youtube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3x3-22Gi3g
look who is in a voice channel already7
that does not sound sfl
i think other stores take sahara mart's business regardless
i feel like there are enough other big grocery stores in bloomington that keep things afloat during that one day for the essentials
^
i think memorial
i forget
or labor day
memorial day
isnt it some kind of holiday
i was just impressed by that old guys trick

first words back in america
= ❌  <:ronald:230126993008623616>
thats the giant question everyone's wondering butr no one is surprised by
every line
this is masterfully crafted
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0EwM9h-7VM
not fair
but it's still unfortunate for team rocket in the end
not the protagonsits
so bascially just a taunt
but didnt even get it
she was offered the signature anyway
it's so mean though
thats why i asked that
i already saw it
they aren't even real villians
i hope they arent this mean to team skull
also why is this show unecessarily cruel to team rocket
the hell
why
why do their heads change into things
this is what z moves where really meant for
shit
and the masked royal
who is also the baseball coach
kukui
and they have one teacher
i guess everyone in pokemon is 10
except for the electric kid
also i totally didnt imagine all the trial captains as kids
even rotomdex
man this has everything
i mean thats canon in the pokedex
gamefreak's greatest creation
snorlax is the best character
god
there are like no rules in this game
meowth just wants to fight
dreamy mr oruoru
this is way too dramatic for what it is
literally impaled
that turtonator just blasted ash
holy shit
thats cheating
WHY THE FUCK DOES THE FLOWER JUST GET TO USE RAPI SPIN
why the fuck are all the strongest trainers playing baseball
i thought it was an american sport
oh
baseball is a strictly american thing right
gotta watch some pokebase pro league
i thought it was obvious
?
i cant belive <:god:230133457630658562> is our only pokemon emote
this only means more time for <:god:230133457630658562>
ronald is 14 minutes late
guess what
it looks like he has a helicopter hat in that picture
i want to cosplay as <:armboy:307590740496875531>
its such a great costplay
he posted a lot more on twitter
is there something thats not 360p
how do you have time
why though
but why did you randomly decide to watch this one
i mean what made you watch it in the first place
where did you find it
i will before ronald gets here
no ive been busy
plus you'll have to unpack
isnt there a thing called jetlag
i somehow doubt you'll be able to play immediately when you land
ok
keenan come play dota with me
What's it doing in a contest
Oh that kind of drm
No what is drm
How was ff Ronald
I almost want it as a joke
How is it more than one paragraph
How is the book that big
tree isnt fast
eggecuter is a literal tree
thats the kinda ratio i like
how long does ff6 take to beat?
40?
thats cheap entertainment right there
^asking the real questions
did you get ff
k
😦
<@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362> dota ?
There's a demo
<@155893986605793281>  I think you would really like disgaea 5 if you need another 80+ hour jrpg to play.
It looks bonkers
What a bamboozle
I reached a part in fire emblem where there were two legendary Pokémon and I could only pick one but I accidentally picked the wrong one by battling the one I liked more
What bothers me even more is people who trade in retro systems that still work
I guess
How have you gotten a used Mario kart but not a 1-2 switch
Used?
https://twitter.com/PONTTOS/status/868269533051662338

"free to play"
any free to play rpg on the app store is a) going to be not good and b) going to require an internet connection probably
they often go on sale for 50% off ronald
well i would call that a fair price
well duh but all of them at least up to 7 are there
just buy final fantasy for like 7 bucks
yes im going to make fun of you
thats the only way i know
southwest has sales you just have to watch out for them
no august
probably not
asher does
i dont
flying standby is all about waiting
yeah and probably more than most people
but even if you're available ronald at most it will be like 3 days on the weekend right?
no i dont need to
ok
no
perhaps
not keenan but ya
its the closest we'll ever get to ronald cosplay
pls do and send pics
lel
para lels
screw parents kids need to understand that as well
it appeals to the common good in saying that drugs are bad
thats just cw being bad

bowser's inside story has a good title stcreen
oh yeah that reminds
i know
this is the best title screen theme of any game https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cpnLPtkdhY
otherwise i dont see how thats allowed
im pretty sure i can only even see the thumbnails because im logged into youtube and 18+
ok his channel is basically just porn ratings
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=78&v=4a6A5FhQePU
"its unlike overwatch where they have thick booties but you cant see them"
does he even play video games
all about thiccness?
whayt is this channel
twintelle has nothing on this
what do you think
that clip wouldnt go on tv
what if he just failed at the first obstactle
no respect
wow what a quitter at the end
you're killing it!
you're killing it!
whos the person behind him cheering him on
is a super hero in real life
esp since he already knows you
in which case it should be even easier
if it's not core for the major but the 400 class is there's no waqy this professor hasnt seen this before
but it could be essential for the 400 class
well it might not be core for the major
no becuase it might not work the 300 class might be a strict requirment
i think he would view it as heres this good student who wants to take my upper level class and i want him in my class again
just make the argument and since he knows you it will probably work
he prbably would
oh then thats probably easier
well the other professor could vouch for you getting out of the class
but you could ask for a note from him
thats dumb you should always talk to professors
i dont think thats avoidable unless you make a convincing argument or the professor already knows your good student/could do the material anyway
when i did it i went through each item of the syllabus of the class i didnt need to take and listed the other classes or experience i had that fulfilled it
like specifically what other classes you have that covered that matieral
you say that but also why you think you dont need the prereq class
Can't win against that combo
Her weapons are the wammy and the homie
I like her
Yeah
Last night I saw him twice
In my one hour I never saw him this morning
It's sad though.
Literally no one plays master mummy
I mean her black skin
She's not even in the testpunch
No it's not thicc queen
My main is 2b aka Bayonetta aka ribbon girl black variant
He's not even my main.
I played him once
Yes.
Yes?
I did?
Smoothly?
No just the first 2/12
Well it's over
<:armboy:307590740496875531>
Thanks Nintendo
hi
no this is not a valve event
its just the name of this particular tournament
ig, og, and secret all in the bottom four of manilla masters
but one game at a time im bring io to the 2-3k meta
no one likes to communicate
it's so hard to win as io in pubs
ursa is a lot better lategame though
and then lategame we just lose
everytime i play io with tiny we dominate the first 15-20 minutes
tiny is a shit hero because he falls off so much after 35 minutes
but not as good as troll or sven  or ursa
hes ok
better start learning a str core io friend
TI INVITE HERE WE COME
natrider?
i really love bat and tinker
except the mirana one is just meh
oh yeah all the rare sets are cool too
hi
are you playing?
no the dc one lets you change between 4 different colors
the problem is there are too many other good veno sets
the brewmaster one is really good though too bad it's a shit hero
and it's the only set for him so that gives it some value
also i tried it in game and it's much more obvious that it's enigma there
i stared at it for 10 seconds initially trying to figure out hwat hero it was fore
most are pretty cool but wyvern is the only one i'll regularly use
thats the only one i care about
i want wyvern
so im kind of mad
sven is literally the only one i didnt want to get
got invoker and sven
i dont think asher appreciates it though
its the most ive ever spammed a hero
if you look at my recent games
yeah and ive been spamming him
you'll get to see my new io skills
ok
<@!125452744440938497> also dota?
<@!155893986605793281> https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/6dhy1o/golf_story_reveal_trailer_coming_this_year_to/di2xiye/
😦 you didnt answer my question
whata re you doing here
its  like stardew valley but for golfing
I'm somehow intrigued by a game about golf
http://golfstorygame.com/
yeah because now i cant ever get another healer unless i happen to find one that wants to join me in a town or if one of my other mages somehow learns a healing move
yeah i think not having marriage means you have to be closer with the guys you do have because you cant have them make new babies
fates?
what last game
brb gotta go breed me some new fire emblem characters
lol "Character relationships are still in the game, but I was somewhat relieved to find that it has no marriage or children.
While I’ve enjoyed getting the most bang for my buck with these mechanics, not having them actually upped the challenge and tension during battle for me.
Even with two different armies, my forces weren’t unlimited!
Not being able to breed replacements made me that much more careful with my battle tactics."
at least on amazon
it was only 60 but it was out of stock until may 29th
it came with a reversible original nes gaiden cover
ugh i regret not buying the limited edition of fire emblem
these are like tights for your arms
shit keenan https://twitter.com/EBGamesCanada/status/868151579219816448
which is funny
stories is just pokemon though
i mean it's just the same exact concept as most mmorpgs but on a smaller scale
i think thats kind of the point of monster hunters stories
that breeding game coming out for the 3ds im actually interested in
idk i think they're pretty cool
i dont really know if that type of gameplay is for me but it's obviously very popular for a reason
so if you like continuously upgrading your gear, fighting cool boss monsters, and complex real time combat systems, then that's pretty much monster hunter
it's literally just an 1-4 player mmorpg with only the raiding and boss fighting components
thanks capcom
lol the monster hunter announcement increased nintendo market value by 2.2 billion overnight
About your typically adventure length
For an adventure
Sounds like a good length
Is it a year long
How many​days did there end up being
Can't you just date everyone and get all the perks
Yeah you could have gotten unlimited free palm readings
But I just need to remember it was her fault and she deserved it
I already feel bad
I'm going to regret killing my mage the rest of the game
Belieeeeeve
Gj
Ok
Because that's doesn't seem very realistic
Just curious
Then how do you kill God with a toy
I thought they were toys
That's dumb how there are guns
Thanks
Oh right he ded
With God?
Except now I don't have any healer so I'm kind of fucked for the rest of the game i think
I don't feel bad
So she basically killed herself
All she needed to do was hit her lifestealer spell once so she would survive the next hit but noooooo
She was my healer but I undid the moves 4 times and she missed her attack everytime so she deserved to die
I let a person die keenan
Same.
It's pretty late isn't it
Hi keenan
<@!125452744440938497>
do you want to play a game?
np right now reminds me a lot of DC at kiev.
they are showing a lot of potential and have close games but just arent winning when it counts
😦
but they almost had all the rax
wow i just realized game 1 was a 20k gold comeback, i should have watched it
it's nostalgic
its been so long since ld godz cast
well that was an hour long fire emblem battle...
about how they arent as good as the rest
i heard some things about the ending parts
<@!155893986605793281> monster hunter is coming to switch.
rip 3ds
i really hope valve or pimpmuckl doesnt get rid of that feature
me too
im waiting for my brother
i dont understand so many people treating this handheld gaming thing like it's revolutionary
it's like these people never heard of the ds line

but what if they win
<@!125452744440938497> are you watching your fav boys vs your least fav boys
Wow.
I bet I could get less dialogue though if I just killed off all the major characters
Although 3hr if that has been dialogue
Like 5hr
Fire emblem
I just zoned out for a minute in class and my first instinct was to press the R button​ and re read the history
I wish there was a dialogue log in real life

https://twitter.com/Dystify/status/867096715328880641

So basically perdona
Because apparently this fire emblem has weaker gameplay than most but a really good characters and production​ value
It's good practice
I figured if I can't make it through a heavily story driven and character based fire emblem then i can't make it persona
So I ordered fore emblem
is that the end ofthe show?
does that count?
what if they retweet but then instantly delete it

leaked screenshot of new super mario bros for the switch
revolutionary.
now its just all the same
each new 2d mario game used to have a distinct look
nintendo also does the same shit with the 2d mario series
doom was really cool looking but it wasnt developed by them
or with even a slightly different art style
i would actually be really hyped for a bestheda game not in the same engine
and so its taking them a while to innovate ont hthe new one
by now the code is full to the brim with different filters
with each new bethesday mod they just add filter upon filter
ez money
they just slapped an instagram filte ron it and called it good
instagram filter
it takes over 5 years to make a new mod
all bethesda games are basically just mods of each other
im pretty sure it didnt really add any new features
and we've gotten a new zelda already
thats like zelda levels of gap
its been over 5 and a half since the last tes though
it's been a decent about of time since that too
fallout 4?
when was the last game they actually developed?
they only published it
it's about that time
i do think we are due for another elder scrolls though
thats the only one that will have real announcements
the evening ones?
thats boring
actually no its just going to be about the scorpio
just to make fun of it
also we might as well watch microsoft's

devolver is just going to talk about their switch ports
well we really only have to watch bethesda ubisoft sony and nintendo
general pc gaming i guess
whats the pc gaming show for then
does valve ever announce anything at e3?

they just hired the kerbal space program team though
so better invest in that
well i think valve's next single player title will be for vr
i think ubisofts might actually be pretty good
convenient isnt it
lol

the showfloor is just open from 13th-15th
i think sony's conference will be the day before though
ya
i think the 13th?
we should have an e3 viewing together
otherwise i just get bored
im fueled by hype
there's nothing to look forward to
i need e3
ugh
lil nick is better
lol
its ok arms testpunch will happen that day instead
rip
i'll tank the waiting for you
i can
thats george micheal

"raised the bar for metroidvanias to infinity" box quote

oh cool that seems early

shh bby is ok
shh
so not netflix or hulu level but hbo level
so it's a subscription you pay for
is that real tv
who even has real tv
isnt it on real tv
how are you guys watching it
dota is the only game that keeps me awak
everytime i try to watch something recently i fall asleep
maybe
no sorry

just first and last episode
lol is that true for every show
uh huh i hear that everytime too
keenan literally everytime they publish an episode they say it's bonkers
60 dollars later i finally got to level 249
oh boy
np
<@!125452744440938497>
want to play?
also i have no patience
which effectively lowers the value
i thought about that but then i would be missing out on all the stuff i get in between like extra tokens and effects
I did say i would buy an arcana if io ever got one but i didnt expect it to happen like this
asher should i get the io arcana
so it isnt just a normal show thats what you're telling me
if i saw this in a show without any context i would probably just ignore it and forget it happened
because on the outside it just seems like any other tv drama
i just kind of wanted to know why you guys liked it because wikipedia cant tell me that part
ok thats what i thought
this is why i just assume you always do weird shit and was surprised
i know you are messing with me but i'd like a non-sarcastic response
see this is the type of shit
i thought it was a direct continuation of the 25 year old seasons
i'd imagine it's not something i could get into into without the previous stuff
i cant tell if thats a trick or not
anyways I usually assume you guys do weird stuff when im not around but nope i guess this is just a normal show that normal people watch
and this is all in preparation for the renewal of the show in a few days?
i see
before the new stuff
or are they airing the old seasons again
how were you watching it yesterday
what show
sounds like it could also be the original content too
oh
oh you meant original content
oc?
i cant believe you guys are just watching a normal tv show
i just looked it up and twin peaks is just a normal tv drama
we could also ask in the iu gaming discord
and built his own computer
he owned several amiibo so he must be cool
idk i could ask
or currently lives?
he lived on the same floor as us
also roger knows someone who has a roommate who plays dota that ive never met but ive based on his apartment that i visited he seemed cool
im pretty sure about half the people in my apartment play dota but i ont know how many of them would read this
oh i guess you do need  to login
do you still have an iu account or do you even need one to access it
csan you access this?
https://apps.iu.edu/ccf2-prd/classifieds?casticket=ST-470383-EgwiFM4fDvqkgXtza6TTcasprd06#/
we could also post to the reddit or the dota2 discord channel but im pretty sure we would get a lot of offers and i kind of would want to vet them first or at least have some sort of application
is that how you want to look
yes
the game is 1 year old wow big news
damn blizzard is making such a huge deal out of their overwatch anniversary
thats the first choice we have to make
do you think we should try and find more people to go with us or just go by ourselves?
<@!125452744440938497> also asher we need to plan ti
its perfect
valve got me again
there goes my money
fuck
ready
Give me an indefinite amount of minutes
buying a hercules beetle?
for what
all around 10/10
and not only that but they are a prime source of animal crossing income
but it can lift 100 times its weight
and it has a massive horn
not only can that thing fly
beetles are the coolest animals

thats a weird way of updating dota

nah you're intermediate

yeah im decent
if he likes it he's probably decent
ad dhim on the switch
you should ask
yeah i saw him tweet about it
we're getting into real web dev territory with the wiki
i think the black scooty slug should just be called scooty
theres only one way to fix that
can you hear me
that was written by the  guy who beat the game
as in winning hard early but not being able to finish
ive been throwing ames a lot lately
sure
yay
go on phone
hey join chat we are starting to discuss enemy names
i tried doing a strat like that but died
like i said
wow i wish i was that good
then i died
i almost built a strategy around that one
what
ronald's seen psych like 6 times
or that it will essentially be a 2-hour long tv episode
how is it starting production this month but coming out in december
http://tumbleseed.wikia.com
yeah and links to the reddit, twitter, discord etc
this should be under gameplay
the other tab is much broader
like lore stuff such as "the way" and general mechanics like "hearts"
whats a good name for a page about things that dont fit into any of our gameplay categories
i know but i could see how someone who is new  would think that
maybe he thinks thats the purpose of a manager
someoe who was a victim of your meanness
trust me i know its true from somewhere
yeah it was mentioned in the tutorial i think
the vineguard is what tumbleseed rolls on
it is
you mean vineguard?
what's thornguard
the tumbleseed chat is just coming up with overly tough enemy ideas
what distance
what?
i thought they were just for a neat stat
you're asking in the wrong chat
distance first, then speed for ties
i think it's just distance

is it 3?
do you know how much the boomeregg costs
its hard to give them personalities if they are clans
clones
i think they should be individuals
as their profession
some seeds definitely have to be dedicated plankers
thanks
so they can be added to the wiki
can you keep note of what they are as you do them
also keenan you haven't done the quests yet right?

I dont know if she also says something in the tutorial
"Advice?
Well...
The harder you try to force it...
The worse off you'll be.
One of those peculiar things about rollin' ..."
no just from the basecamp
and I got her exact dialogue
who is somewhat rare
I also took a picture of the Boss
like turdly here
in the google drive i added a bunch of images for articles you can create
Turdly
ah
you keep pulling ronalds
yeah you were awake at 4:30
i added a caption for it
lol
<@!155893986605793281> torcado did some testing
in the history no one edited it but me and you
its a typo
?
i changed the theme
http://tumbleseed.wikia.com/wiki/Thornvine
done
i added it to trivia
<@!125452744440938497> cloud 9's first game https://www.twitch.tv/epicenter_en1
this man is perfect
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3o_ZKWi-OU
otherwise you're wasting a domain name
better get working on it
<@!127535721857679362> want to play
with how tightly i grip everything to drift and brake
or my fingers
i feel like playing 200cc is going to break my switch
especially if they have 3dses
how arent they already familiar with mario kart
almost too epic
the ti7 music pack is way more epic than the game itself
cool
he asked earlier so we might want to wait for him
ok what about asher
<@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362> dota?>
<@155893986605793281> https://i.redd.it/1akxqpi2hxvy.png
When are we going to go see them live
https://youtu.be/XSmAByGdanA
https://youtu.be/u0geYIz2wug
Scrub
https://youtu.be/8KtqcWfrB74
Alright I will in a bit
wow somehow im still at 34% battery after all that
lol theres this one guy online that im 0-10 against
im 19-6
oh cool in the stats section i can see my winrate versus you
i was just making circles with my tire tracks
by being dumb
you hit me
dude i was literally spinning donuts
Nice try!
and lost everything
until i died
i was winning
i was doing so well both rounds
i feel like losing half of my balloons is too harsh of a penalty
i had 8 balloons and literally lost half of them from dying
if it was last man standing what stops people from just stalling and avoiding people the whole game
yeah that would be way better
to make it more accessible or something
because thats what they did
on a scale of 1 to suck i suck
they are pretty rare
i only got a red shell once that whole time
no you have to juke
i like it because i win
i'll switch
i think it's different
yeah you collect people's lives by killing them
in both you just collect shit
i dont even see how its different than coin runners
no balloon battle is the most boring mode
rekt
balloon is the worst though
no i could only choose one type
😦 what happened back there
i saw you try to land on that train
i wonder what they are trying to imply about yoshi
always
yoshi courses have so many curves
besides snes rainbow road
thats my biggest weakness
oh pls not the yoshi course
i havent even touched it yet but they brough back a lot of the original modes
at some point we should try battle mode because i hear thats really good
how sweet
aww we both have crowns
that was good
blue shell > red shell > red shell > green shell > lightningbolt > squished
ok let me explain here why i got 2nd
omfg
at the end
did you throw those two red shells at me
and the closest thing we have to modern fzero
like that level is so pretty
its like candy
ok
dd?
i should go look at the course in mk gba
i can
its too complex
yeah i dont even know how the ribbon one could have originally been on gba
to make me stronger
which is why i picked it
that course is my weakness
this will be the new mkds in terms of sales prob
at least you're beating iggy
law of wario
you can only use him if your good
why are you wario
im ready
<@!155893986605793281> IM READY
<@!127535721857679362> join call
ronald play with us
i ccan play mario kart during dota queues keenan
they also had better towers
lol
update
unless you want me to only listen
i cant call asher
this is basically whats happening right now
just on my wall
as a live feed of the discord chat at all times
what if i just had a tv monitor with discord full screened
this is essentially just using my laptop as a remote keyboard for my computer
magical
but i can like type on my laptop and send messages to my other computer
that computer says im awya on discord
i see myself typing on my other computer
6am is prime working time
go to bed earlier
you should be too
sleep > all else
protip:
im pretty sure the compendium is worth it just for this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9ZppjmgzKI
wow you'll go to china for ronald but not to seattle for us
because what other game can you play during downtime
im pretty confident you can play in china
im going to recalibrate my solo mmr
i always play a lot in the summer
what else would we do with our tickets
yeah
same except the cm one
they must be making an io arcana otherwise he would be in the vote
oh shit something is happening https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/69bi6a/io_is_not_a_candidate_for_arcana_bracket/
at the start of a match, once per week, you can decide if you want to double down on the mmr gain/loss
the lifestealer one is literally just him breakdancing
these taunts are getting more and more clowny
if you get to level 305 in the battle pass you get the ?
deny effect
lol you can now wager mmr
DOTA IS LITERALLY TORCHLIGHT NOW
ITS HERE BOYS

Ç9 is back
seems like a pretty normal ppt to me
you can probably convince ronald in another 4 years after he retires overweatch
yeah no
Requires monthly subscription.
what the fuck is this
yeah probably
im trying to reduce my clients here
me
not on steam
no it's not
steam sale
ok good
thats my policy
i dont play games lower than a 90

" The game’s selling points appear to be a) turn-based combat, b) two-player local co-op, and c) a goofy sense of humor. (The art we’ve seen features Mario and crew wielding laser beams.) "

they dont even need to make another f-zero game when these exist
The f zero tracks in mk8 with 200cc are so exhilarating
It's some asmr shit
I'm addicted to the sound and art
its not ubisoft
yea why wouldnt you
what do you know me too
so how are you doing
im just going to spend the whole game in these test chambers
stay humble
thats nice of them to cover up the holes you fall in
theres 30 more seed varieties too
wtf this guy just stole all my hard earned crystals
yea
holy crap the music and sound design is incredible
not precise enough
no its not a tilt game
this got dark real quick
this is just katamari but with seeds
they are so cute
i dont want to delete them
those tetrises though

http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/tumbleseed-switch
but this random one blew up
the mushrooms in this game are usually friendly
how was i supposed to know that mushroom would do that
wtf i just hit a mushroom and it blew me up
toomblesid
plus the music and graphics are nice
its honestly the ideal game for you
i think speed runners have beaten it in 15 minutes
for high score
its only an hour long but has shit tons of speed run and replay potential
yeah it looks neat
fucking geniuses
god crypt of the necrodancer is such the perfect game
i'll finally have friends
yay
no but you can buy it here when its live http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/tumbleseed-switch
tumbleseed is on te eshop
15 minutes
if you get the high score each day you get 500 bucks
like i said
ok
what are you comparing it to
i think tumbleseed is a little different than other rouge likes
then you could compete in their 500 dollar daily challenge
that would be pretty impressive
it only takes like 45 minutes to beat tumbleseed but a long time before you get there
i thought it was crossbuy
<@!155893986605793281> buy this https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/crypt-of-the-necrodancer/cid=UP1162-PCSE00806_00-CRYPTNECRODANCER
for the best marble rolling darksouls sim of ever
get ready

they just released dual audio for zelda
WOAH
WOW
he didnt reply to my @ and it's been 6 minutes
i dont think hes coming
<@!125452744440938497>
we can play now unless asher is coming soo
ok
<@!127535721857679362> <@!125452744440938497> tell me if someone awants to play dota later tonight
1 in 2 switch owners bought it on release day
mk8dx sold more than mario kart wii on its first day
maybe the deluxe edition adds multiplayer
https://twitter.com/SPepOfficial/status/859004253590913024
whenever you arent high or doing homework add me as a friend
everytime you say mk i think monkey king
no
technically my mario kart costed about 1.5 tetris
unless you cheat
no two
it costs about two tetrises but i'll play it about twice as much so it all works out
looks like candy
I want to eat it
i agree https://twitter.com/Babylonian/status/858849685737426944
pls
join me pls
so wholesome
lol I love this "booth guy cheers on og" https://gfycat.com/PitifulBrightCaracal
link cant ride a tricycle in botw
literally better than zelda
ronald's brother is probably going to play mario kart with me before any of you
someone needs to get mario kart so they can play online with me
<@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362> if anyone wants to play dota let me know, it's probably the last day i can until after finals
win 4 majors, still less prize money than winning TI
og just played extremely well from behind
they were 18-3 and i dont reallytt think they made any mistakes
i dont even think it was vp's fault that they lost
i think they proved they are good at everything
i mean theres only so many classes of strategies in dota
i think they only picked tb once and aside from that had no other radiance or illusion heroes
to be fair they had completely different strats for that grand finals
i feel like every game theyve been ahead, even the ones theyve lost
are vp seriously going to throw their 3rd game this series
not including in game
wow 600k viewers
lol
you dont have any games to play with me so theres no point of being friends
no
yes
a registered friend?
?
<@!125452744440938497> this might be the first full 5 game grand finals at a valve event besides ti3
thats what i would do
it will be an experiment
and then compare the two
one while high and one while not high
you should write two papers
good luck man
lol ok
checkmate
never would have happened without the weed in the first place
yeah and whose fault is that
i think it has a little to do with it
if it sucks so much then dont do it
actually cant you do it better while high
tsk tsk
either we see virtus pro win their first major LAN in several years...
or we see og win their 4th major.
hmmm who to root for...
this grand finals is going to be hype
well at least they didnt use illusion heroes game 2
its very close
fuck if eg gets 2-0d here....
ad finem v2
on sk and enigma
tavo is amazing
there have ben several like that by tavo
with 2 days to spare before compendium expires
Im so happy
I finally got my purple treant set
esp when mag is banned
in general more teams should be picking dark seer
he's way better at ds than magnus and they serve like the same purpose
i was really pissed that DC didnt pick that for bulba instead
i agree
So many good team fight combos by both teams
If you're going to watch any vods of Kiev, watch game 3 of vp vs vici
The crowd, the casters, and the game are all so hype
Vp vs vici is awesome
This vp game is crazy, the TA is like double the networth of the next guy
<@127535721857679362> Ronald play dota with me
Yeah of course
He's the only one not playing dumb ass heroes
S4 is really good though
Now i understand
Yeah I just never really watched their games before
Fucking all they pick is naga alch and terrorblade
I'm so sad, OG beat faceless by picking naga all three games
<@127535721857679362> <@125452744440938497> can anyone play dota this morning
asher you should make your name Dota so I can just type @Dota to ask if you want to play
cool
and <@!125452744440938497> are you going to play later tonight?
biggest upset in dota history
you better watch this
hey guys the brazilians might take out secret
ashers a good man too
lying = bad
good man
the onlyl thing good about him is that he's purple
waluigi is overrated in my opinion
acutlaly waluigi is the next arms character
maybe he'll have a cameo in odyssey
they are all about that new ip
i would not be surprised
what could possibly be next
we already got fork chefs
im scared for odyssey
and she fights in a ramen bowl!
springs and ribbons
it started out real mild
lol arms characters slowly get crazier
HOW DO YOU CHOOSE
FUCK THEY ARE ALL PERFECT
FIND THE ARM BOY
🥒 🥒 🥒  <:armboy:307590740496875531> 🥒 🥒 🥒 🥒
WHICH ONE IS THE ODD ONE OUT
<:armboy:307590740496875531> 🥒 🥒
although dna boy is my only savior on this sorrowful day
god this freaks me out
<:armboy:307590740496875531>
transparent arm boy
i'll work on it
in 10 years i will have enough data to give you a sensative response
I will add it as a data point in my mental database of relationship stuff
i agree
thats mean keenan
its finally time to change our server icon
WHICH APPARENTLY ISNT TRUE RIGHT NOW
yea and CONVENIENCE

lol
http://www.polygon.com/2017/4/28/15474302/mario-kart-8-amazon-delays
i was planning to
actually just all his animations
also his idle animations make me really uneasy
how can you say that
are perfect
the sounds he makes
its the only good thing that i enjoyed today
did you see that arms video though
how will i ever become pro
now i will only have 1 day to play before finals instead of 2
its not the same keenan
but no
all i ask was for one mario kart
for you it probably wont
yeah although tomorrow it will all be better
ok well i dont know if thats a fair comparison
a boy just needs his mario kart
im really sad
amazon is disappointing me right now
https://youtu.be/X2Wzy4p-v2c
im going to bed
iim confused
why are they so strange
even when they have so much to announce
i love how nintendo continually refuses to host large scale press conferences at e3
it looks so strange
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/857771492297252868
new ds
wtf
they get money
i, as a different consumer, care
i care
but inside probably has better gameplay
yeah i was just going to say thats whats good about it
idk inside was goty for several publications and people
And by the time I finish those little nightmares will be 5 bucks on steam sale
I have to play limbo and inside before little nightmares
Maybe this is my punishment for getting Tetris a day early
At least if it comes late I can complain and get 20 bucks
We don't have drones yet amazon
Da fuk
"arrives tomorrow"
"shipping soon"
Can someone explain how the fuck

Yeah the mario kart one is the only good one
They have like 2 other vids besides Mario kart in this series
https://youtu.be/MitTk8SMN6I
If it's not already a regular thing
They should make parody game reviews a regular thing because there's so much shit game journalists say that you can make fun of
Yeah
They should become a real video game reviewing site
They make a lot of great points in that video
https://twitter.com/ClickHole/status/857755775749455874
impressive
they've been in stock for like 45 minutes now
amazon just got a really large shipment of switches
LD cast PogChamp
although actually maybe he was at a lan when he played for c9 for a couple months
jesus i just realized it's been almost 3 years since mason was last at a lan
mason has at least 5 different memes
but the combined bulba demon and mason memes far make up for it
every player has their own meme except for abed and dubu
i love dc
<:god:230133457630658562>
Pokémon.
https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/857553533104672768
this liquid newbee game is crazy
damn 2.74 million switches sold in the first mont is impressive considering it wasnt a holiday month
wtf you literally just painted your computer screen
<@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362>
how about some dota
hey asher
i think it should be hard for the first few weeks but then it gets easy and thats where it's less frustrating
well i know but i just dont want to invest time in only a 2-3 week thing
why do we have to do a temp thing
i also dont want resources to be finite, but just very hard to get
like i dont want it to remain hard for the entire map, i want eventually to acheive something big under the strenuous conditions
the only thin that im concerned about with this mod is the expansion potential after you overcome the initial difficulty curve
oh we've been chatting in here
Why
Lol
Why
Lol
They are actually pretty low tier key chains so i was kind of disappointed
So couldn't pass that up
But I literally collect key chains
I would have gotten digital without the keychains
But my point is that it didn't matter overall since prime is great
Two keychains
Switch retail is 10 more but amazon discount makes it the same price as the other versions plus you get the keychains
The PS4 version is the same price as switch digital
Thanks Amazon
It also came a day early
Yeah duh it's cheaper
No because I got them
I know when
Who's going to win
Ok Keenan what are your major predictions
When
Also asher we have to play dota and make our bracket predictions tonight
Or Tetris
Anyone want to play Mario kart
also what are your bracket predictions?
they should eliminate some teams during the group stage, like the ones that lost all three series
yeah it's a little strange
<@127535721857679362> https://youtu.be/6Nxc-3WpMbg
ready <@!127535721857679362> <@!125452744440938497>
give me like 30 min
yerah i can
https://www.reddit.com/r/games/comments/676mki/_/
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH2AG5FfTNs
holy shit i dont even play the game but based on the music and art alone this is the best remaster of a game ive ever seen
we're going to have to take another car ride now
missed car ride sound track opprotunity keenan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1JE-TkYZB0&list=PL_Jac7pDr15MRo9TCzredXCF6Dc12dmxU
good hacking
I think
MacCookie69
It was the same as hulu
thanks buddy we will all play it right away on our macs
this game looks so beautiful https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C-Mjz11W0AAgpXv.jpg
They are so rare these days
Finally we get a good dota tournament
Kiev major is great
nah im going to go to bed soon
https://youtu.be/3NQWP7npOSw
Yeah
It's ok I'm still ready in time
Lol just got home and still need to pack
also for you it doesnt matter, you can just use your parent's or brother's phone number if you need two accounts
valve has some kind of god powers that perhaps you arent considering
you can try to fool them with your smurf
idk
they said that "Online services that provide phone numbers are not allowed."
wait what is reddit going to complain about now?
yeah
well you're correct because i cant play today
<@!127535721857679362> wow ronald you are playing dota and didnt even invite me
oh i accidentally did it when i put my phone in my pocket
wait did i pin that

Fuck no roller coaster is going on the island
it would also be cool if there were npcs that we could make do stuff for us
i want a mod that lets me make actual roller coaster tracks like loops
and i want roller coaster
not glide
i just want something that lets me fly
theres literally a minecraft mod for everything
ronald
like iron and diamons and whatever new ore they add
vanilla tools may become obsolete but i think the industrial tools will still require a lot of basic vanilla resources to craft
and just make roller coaster tycoon
but above the island is just a massive roller coaster
guys we should have this island
oh boy a whole hour
they dont really break once you start enchanting
im pretty sure you need like 50 diamonds in minecraft before you're good on tools for the rest of the game
even on the last server, the fact that you had 700 diamonds didnt really help you at all
ronald i think the point of this server is that ore wouldn't be that important
its kind of hard to have separate properties when space is so limited
im pretty sure with an island onlt 500 blocks wide we would all end up sharing resources anyway
but not without work first
and it just becomes creative
so that eventually we would get to the point where resources are completely free
actually maybe tech and more farming automation would be cool
there would be trade but only between the four of us
see but i feel like this map structure would be interesting even without mods
or start expanding the island with dirt
also if we had just an island with water in every other direction we could eventually industrialize the entire thing and make a big city out of it
so like 450
that would be so useful
to run websites or minecraft servers off of
and have a server i can ssh to whenever
i think i want to build a 300-500 always on linux box
lol this weekend will be us going to comic conventions by day and configuring minecraft servers by night
90% wiki reading 10% playing
there will be a lot of wiki reading
still takes time to learn
the whole point of minecraft is to have something to do when you are focusing on other things
i can just do shit
part of the reason vanilla minecraft is so appealing for me is that im so good at it that it doesnt take any consideration to play
takes effort
like a whole new game
tahts so much learning
im too much of a minecraft purist to have any good ideas about mods
but give me money, a map, and some mods and i can set it up in chicago
but no it ded
yeah but i thought the map was still alive just hidden somewhere in the vast cloud
give me a minute to mourne
yo when you lose a dear child you dont just go make a new one right away
:'''''''''''''''''''(
:((((((((((((((
yeah because it went poof
we werent going to use it again but it has sentimental value
the latest version i have of it is probably when i transferred from amazon to google
rip map
rip
i think i deleted the disk too instead of making a backup
i completely delteed it because google was still charging me for the persistant disk
i think when i terminated the instance i forgot to save a snapshot of it locally
i dont care as much about the map as I do about the infrustructure I set up behind it like the auto-updating online world map
fuck i hope i have all the data from the old server still saved somewhere
but i think google cloud might be better pricing wise
or if ronald buys an ec2 instance for textin we can use that
with mods or whateever you want
if anyone wants to pay me to set up a server i will again
i wanted to select abed for some things but couldnt
not for the player stuff
im offended
new DC isnt even an option for them
i just did my predictions
<@!127535721857679362> <@!125452744440938497> dota?
holy shit this instrumentation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0No1WPXWEis
a cpu would be hard to borrow
the car lacks the required immersion
probably not
and go back to his roots
link can fuck around all he wants in the 100 hours leading up to the fight but when he actually begins the fight he has to keep it classy
i have to beat the game as the classic hero
because they give you links original tunic
no thats the whole point of getting the shrines
like can you imagine if this were real and you had just woken up and everyone was counting on you to save the world but then you didnt train hard enough and just die
that's been dead for 100 years
it makes it seem like im some epic hero
i also enjoy the feeling of being overpowered
trust me i dont just leave ganons roaming around in the wild like that
yeah
and i refuse to look them up
i have 8 left
well i have to get all the shrines first
thats only because shovel knight is a good game
ug why couldnt mario kart come out 6 days sooner so i could play mario kart while in a car
<@!125452744440938497> also did you get this one since it was on sale today https://9to5toys.com/2017/04/19/samsung-850-evo/
OKAY
im just saying
youtube red lets you do that
or you could just download it from youtube
yes he got the psecial edition
so i can least start the queue
yo join my party
no mic?
<@!127535721857679362> also ronald we should call
<@!125452744440938497> dota?
lol next time
which is why nier doesnt look as great graphically as some other ps4 games because they needed to hit 60 fps
framerate is still important in singeplayer for a lot of games
graphics dont matter but framerate actually does affect gameplay
also for a lot of games framerate is really important
it doesnt affect gameplay at all but it's still neat to look at
like with skyrim mods
also i think you start to appreciate graphics more when you have the capability to run them
unless you only watch netflix and check email
so i think it's always a good investment
true but a powerful computer is useful for things other than gaming
but yeah thats convenient
there are many reasons for having a gaming capable pc besides those things
yeah!
only dota boys would understand
thats what i thought ronald would do when he got a new computer but im pretty sure he actually went down in mmr because he prefers 24fps
asher what if you instantly become 6k because of 60 fps
in fact, i'd say it happens about once every 16 weeks
this whole week is extremely rare
i only have 2 assignments due this week
*extremely* rare
this is extremely rare
shush
keenan
<@!127535721857679362> <@!125452744440938497> we can play if you want, i just need 5 minutes to eat dinner
Mmmmm
<@!127535721857679362> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wJ7hHDVBnA
they had a short mini feature on how they made the music and it was really cool
this wonder boy remake has amazing remastered music https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYXzXBbFKOY

<@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362> ok i can play now
no
nvm i forgot i have something due at midnight
yeah
If it were a couple hours ago I would have played
I think I'm too tired and I have to wake up early
Because I think I'm going to go to bed
Now?
<@!127535721857679362> <@!125452744440938497> dota?
hnnng
i dont think nvidia's grant funds the xp yet
but we dont want to build a whole new computer for it so i'll probably just stick it in mine at home
because we need a card that is good at doing deep learning
im actually going to apply for a grant soon to get a titan x for research purposes
i doubt your cpu is more that 50 degrees celsius under load ronald
also keeping the computer not on the floor helps immensly with dust
yeah you should
you're thinking in celsius right?
mine never gets above 35-40 degrees and i think some people have like 50 average so there's definitely a lot of leway there
im also pretty sure any air cooler that isnt a stock cooler can adequately cool your cpu even if it's overclocked a bit
yeah i bumped it up a little i think
im not even overclocking that much because i didnt want to stress anything out
i kind of regret it though because i think it's unecessary
no i use aio liquid
i5 6600k overclocked to 4.2/4.3
half my build was corsair products
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0134EW7G8/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1
i wonder if prices went up
but im looking at the exact model i got and now it's 119
i feel like mine was more like 95
oh i guess you're right on ram
but i get you on the buying stuff part
im pretty sure your ram is extremely overpriced
that new star wars trailer was almost as epic as the botw one
classic jrpg
lol
get to play what
it's by one of my favorite developers
this game is going to be great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_cfPNbwIUI
I think you'd actually have to talk with him to find out
I really dont know
sure but he may also just have some fundamentally different beliefs in what he thinks you can and cant learn
I dont think he really cares about his image on facebook because otherwise he wouldnt be doing it there
I think he really cares, its just a not something he's explored a lot yet and hasnt done every opportunity out there.
In time he may participate in more facilitated discussions outside of facebook and I guarantee you that this past week he's been thinking adn reading about it a lot
I can see that but at the very least they should be  more respectful about it
because they are against discourse
maybe the reason why he hasnt shut up is because no one is willing to tell him whats wrong about his academic perspective
because i think you're just making assumptions here
well maybe you should actually talk with him
just because he's not one of the opressed doesnt mean he doesnt care about the issues
he's almost certainly very invested in it
you cant call him not invested in it when you have never talked to him
but the people who do get to decide whats racist or sexist dont allow any leway for changing their mind on those things.
like I think he's just frustrated by the fact that some people seem to arbitrarily call things racist or sexist without any solid ground behind it just because it's what they heard through the media or other people.
from his point of view there should be a logical reason behind all that and in charles murray's case there really isnt
I understand that he doesnt get to decide what exactly is racist or sexist
he has literary experience
presenting a counter-argument in a polite way is opressive?
I dont think so,  I think he's just trying to let people see the usefulness of good discussion.
and its hard for him to do that because everytime he talks hes "opressing" them
that probably didnt make sense
that he wants to correct
yes I know and roger also knows that but I think for him, he sees a fundamental flaw in the nature how the people he's talking with reply to his discussions
its just giving him more attention and a larger platform while at the same time not allowing discourse on the topic
fine but if you dont have that accessibility then you shouldn't be spending time doing things like protesting something you dont understand because that accomplishes nothing
what do you mean accessibility
if anything, having him speak a good way to encourage thoughtful discussion on the topic that ends up being better for everyone
I get that but in this case the people in the culture are barely educated on what they are protesting against.
Like if you don't like his views, instead of preventing him from speaking, you should listen and challenge him directly on it.
thats how people's ideas develop and evolve.
if murray has bad ideas and they are never challenged they will just stay that way
many of the people protesting charles murray havent even read his stuff, they just see one article calling him a racist and a sexist and cling on to that, and then someone like roger actually spends time researching all sides of it because he wants the full story.
if anything that makes him more qualified to discuss it
I do not see how that's true
on one side you have people who are stuck in their understanding of the politics and dont like to be challenged and on the other side you have people who wont be able to understand because they arent allowed to
If that's true then it's ends up being bad for both sides
like it's the only thing you can do
and i think that discussion when you arent affected by it at all with someone who is is one of the best ways to get see the others viewpoint more clearly as if you were in that position
the problem is that every time he even attempts to look at opposing views and have a rational discussion, he gets shut down and called a sexist
I think he would far prefer it if he wasnt getting emotional responses and if he could actually have a real discussion
How is it elitist bullshit
He's frustrated by the state of discourse on campus
Why is that yikes
He says he enjoys being frustrated by people who are so close minded like that
good sign
all the successful people are playing the games i like
this time it's botw
last time it was minecraft
lol the keynote speaker we have for mucsc is a zelda nerd
Lol boobie news direct to my switch
k
it's extremely rare that i can play on a weekday
<@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362> dota?
i didnt even know the 3ds had a brain training game
weird
oh nemd i guess it's been out in the us for like 4 years uner a different name
woah europe is getting a new brain training game
well it's still a different type of experience i think
oh your right
you dont really have a lan party with your xboxes
well no, you can only hae split screen for two people
i mean the point is you can have a multiplayer world without any sort of online server
it also has split screen but the other consoles have that too
like how you would play smash or something
like with up to four switch systems
also they announced local co-op for minecraft which i think is actulaly a neat feature unique to the switch version
so this would seem less weird
milk was just to get us prepared
lol this was on reddit

Engineer 1: You know what's really holding gaming back?

48 courses, 23 items, 5 battle modes, 8 battle mode courses, and 42 characters
holy shit theres so much content in mk8 deluxe
im pretty sure i would too
i think you both would really enjoy it
yeah
or over skype
like this saturday
or do it next time you come to bloomington
and send me the convo
you should do it via private message
no i dont think you are
or read it
i'd watch that debate
yeah it would be interesting to see what you agree on and what you dont
lol
and you have very different views
because you've both had involvement in it via clubs
like a formal one
ronald i think you and roger should have a debate
ya
he definitely didnt anticipate it though
i think he enjoys it though because it's a mental exercise and he likes debating
its under one of shailey's posts
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpO4z0ycJb8
I think i found the best zelda song
guys i dont know why my code dont work
not an auto dealership
ah
brb googling lincoln-douglass
im glad he finally ended it
i literally told him that if it were me, I would have stopped the discussion a long time ago and that you werent getting anywhere like that
it just maybe wasnt very constructive on facebook and with those people
there's definitely merit to learning through discussion though
so maybe he'll follow up
to be fair he did ask those girls for reading material
well yeah i never talk about him
which is the only thing
except for the desire to learn of course
also i realized i have like nothing in common with roger
we are always to busy and never really see each other
tonight was actually the first night we've talked in like 2 weeks
hes not
a lot of people lack that these days
and to be intellectual
i admire his desire to learn
to be fair
thats probably what they are
but thats definitely just his style and his formal debate training
yeah it might not be the best for a facebook setting
i think it's better to be polite and formal than abrasive
prove yourself
keenan now is your chance to correct that
because he's such an upstanding community member
i bet asher would go even if his gf and me werent involved in organizing it
you can come at 9:30 and then leave early
come to the conference
anyway keenan
I cant wait until the switch game about cars 3 comes out
and it seemed like people didnt understand that
hes just a boy seeking information
because he wasnt going to convince anyone
and i actually agreed with him but i told him it was useless to keep debating it
later on in the debate it just became very meta
thats not a forum troll though
he only seeks understanding it's not like he is maliciously doing it
i strongly disagree with that
and talking to roger about it actually
i know i was just reading that
ronald is always there
yeah he will ask him
ronald will be there
i will be there
asher will be there
you should also go regardless
you should email anastia about it
http://mucsc.info
so you might
so we emailed your ai instead
but he's bad at responding
we are actually trying to see if your professor would offer it
mucsc.info
cog sci conference
there now i'll get a person
<@!155893986605793281> come to mucsc
hold on
i should be in the fine print though
you are correct
wow asher i cant believe you put "my gf" as your contact for mucsc and not me
Args are dumb
The trailer was cool
But guys
we should play overwatch
what a cool trailer

i think fluidity was the best tilt game
i thought that was called fluidity
dafukisdat
sorry i'll give you credit
oh ok
question marks may ruin my dota game but not my life
you just have to learn to not care
but you dont really commit longterm
you try all these
i just dont think you're a multiplayer game kind of guy
or just play them at the store
do you own those games
*modern keenan
sorry forgot about that
paper io
thats it
you play darksouls
not true
keenan playing a multiplayer game?!?!?!
woah
i cant tell if serious
and i think it actually innovates on the genre
that game looks really cool too
have you heard of a hat in time?
i dont think i can resist a colorful ninteno-like game
i actually want yooka laylee now
sounds like he needs to start his own comic series
lol wut
no wonder it was recalled
why does kitty pryde look like she has a beard
'
it was probably problematic because it didnt contain enough wolverine
like the whole experience between the colors, sounds, rumble, is just really satisfying
its really cool
and the rumble is subtle but it clearly adds a different texture to each weapon
when you pull off a huge combo
it's extremely satisfying
its going to make me really good at nier
it's also beautiful
it's like the perfect mobile switch game
graceful explosion machine
you know whats also a really good indie game that i just got
i also really like the art style
yeah
its fun
ive played it, it's literally nightcrawler
its like hotline miami but if you were nightcrawler
also i kind of want mr.
shifty
but im hoping it comes to switch so it can be portable
i want to get that game
because you arent master enough
i bet you havent even done that
im gonig to beat all 3 campaigns
now im a master
once you realize that, there's no real pnealty for dying besides frustration
its also a lot easier than i thought it was
like it forces me to use money wisely and spend it in smart ways such that I never have too much surplus to lose
and changes the core way i play the game
i never realized until now how much its death mechanic affects gameplay
shovel knight
you know whats ar eally good game
🦉
in 6 months
but im excited to play it
no
me too
i got question marked at 5 minutes in the game the other night which is why i tilted and lost the rest of the game
?
keenan why you never reply to me
sorry give me a sec
<@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362> Dota?
https://twitter.com/TristanACooper/status/850032458208870400
Good cuz Sunday is my dota winning night
can you play dota <@!125452744440938497> ?
that way whatever color you decide to light up the mobo with will reflect off the ram
or get white ram
get ram without any leds
https://twitter.com/_mrsteak/status/850572755015573505
I'll try to find it online at some point Asher
Oh.
Movie.
Idk what that is
he might have sold it idk
he, his girlfriend, and one other guy were owners
no one knows why
i dont know if he got kicked he might have just left
and they'll get a new core
i think ee will support
https://twitter.com/MSSDota/status/850130343541735424
😦
<@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362> if anyone wants to play dota i can play a game in like 30 minutes.
i cant play tomorrow
what if
make a note
rip adventure mode
yes but that was just brawl
lol it would be funny to see smash's system in a normal platformer or something
yeah because the game is really easy if you dont care about points but if you dont have points you just look bad
kirby's epic yarn has the same system as sonic
thats what would happen if i tried to make a game so i can relate
yeah
now it has like 3 people working on it
minecraft only had like 2 people working on it for 4 years before it officially released
why dont you email him about it
now it's in prebeta
in 50 years i'll be telling my grandkids that i remember when df was in pre-aplha
mhmm
but with 3d graphics and multiplayer
like imagine of you combine the two
yeah but they lack what minecraft has of fine tuning and crafting every detail of each building
probably because the suite of tools for that would be so huge
if i had a ps4 it would have two games, dq builders and persona 5
i want to play dq builders
yeah true
which is why the switch would run it better
also your laptop and my laptop dont have dedicated graphics cards
idk
we'll see
would be fun
idk i could maybe play it on switch
yeah weird
but still
my laptop battery is more important for stuff other than for games.
also i cant play it on a bus on a train on a plane on a couch upside down
also its weird how a lot of kids have only played portable minecraft on phones
laptop minecraft will have lower performance and render distance than swithc
ive never experienced that before
portable minecraft
i just realized
oh fuck
yes
but lego games are always better multiplayer
as in not primarily multiplayer
oh shit thats a singleplayer game
yeah
whats the difference
yeah yes my favorite nintendo game
actually i guess fire emblem is a thing
so technically not until mario
which i wont even buy
i just realized nintendo isnt going to release another single player game until xenoblade 2
if you want to borrw my wii u for bayonetta 2 let me know
i will
3 person indies teams are able to create way better experiences
and not by reviewers standards
not by my standards
that do it way better
if you want non-nintendo co-op games there are plenty of other great indie games
ok but you cant praise yl for being a good couch co-op game when the couch co-op it has sucks
yes keenan
and it interrupts normal gameplay
because there are parts in the main game where you are forced to play the arcade stuff
better to just not include it
but they included it and did a lousy job
its like just not fun to play
no its definitely not purposeful sucking
control wise and performance wise
yeah and ive heard those suck
isnt it just in the arcade games
and when it goes on sale
if i get it it would be for pc
it aint out yet
it's pretty cool
i played the beta of mr.
shifty
because like why cant you get those endings on the first run
is it obvious how to do the subsequent endings or do you have to look them up
OKAY
besides the pc of course
also for cross platform games the scorpio will be the clear winner
you dont even have a 4k tv
no i doubt it
because of software optimizations that pc doesnt have
scorpio will offer better performace than a pc at equivalent price
well you dont get those on pc either
its basically everything you get on pc except less and without steam sales
and for people who dont want any good games
because for sure it will run better than a pc at equivalent price
no but it seems like a legitimate option for people who want high performance and dont want to build a pc
even without a finals ticket you can still come for a weekend you just wouldnt be able to watch dotes with us
<@!127535721857679362> the sooner the better i guess but all i really need to know is if you want a finals ticket or i try to find someone else who will buy it
We have to determine what to do with the extra set but hopefully it will be for whoever rooms with us
@<@127535721857679362> not hard to sell especially because most people selling tickets mark up the price a lot.
I have 2 midweek and 2 finals and Asher has 1 midweek and 1 finals.
Lol you can even waste your money on the expensive dota beer bar
shouldnt be hard to sell later
fuck it, i'll just get two of both just in case
<@!127535721857679362> because if you can only come friday-sun youwouldnt be able to come in with us
<@!127535721857679362> wait ronald do you want a finals ticket
thats weird
on my phone, it lets me choose quantity for midweek but for finals it doesnt let me choose anything
thats a better idea
or wait maybe i should prioritize finals tickets
unless you dont get in
im planng to get 2 midweek and 1 finals
if you dont get in i can also buy your tickets
i dont think so but im going to prioritize week tickets and have my computer also open for finals tickets
lol
i already set up ticket master and have it open on both my phone and computer so im ready to go
becuase if it falls through we can always sell the third ticket and go ourselves or  sell all the tickets and not go if rooming is too expensive
that way it keeps the most options open
well if you do want to stay the whole week i think the best way to go is to buy an extra midweek just in case and try to find someone if not keenan to room with us
i wonder if we could find random people on reddit to live with us lol
huh
oh your right about the plane ticket investment
i cant tell he doesnt have interest for dota or doesnt have interest for going to seattle
maybe we should just go to the finals and assume ronald will be able to make it
<@!125452744440938497> yo asher  what should we do.
keenan isnt replying so i dont know if he would even come if we got him a ticket.
i dont think the cost of the ticket would even be the problem for him since he would still be paying for travel and living
ive been doing an assignment that i thought was due tomorrow but actually isnt due until next week
i actually could have played dota
goddamnit
no i need to do work right now
its a 22 minute drive from the airport to key arena
yeah theres almost certainly a shuttle
and buses
they have trains
im sure we wouldnt
but we still need keenan to room with us for the other days to cut costs
yeah maybe
yeah that doesnt work 😦
if they only give you a pre-determined stipend for the flight, if the flight from seattle to NC is more than sf to nc then you could probably just pay the difference yourself
also ronald you can still get tickets just for the finals at least, it seems like you have a decent chance of being able to make it for friday and saturday
like if keenan went for the first 4 days at least
if we got an air bnb for 3 people, would they care if we had a fourth staying with us for the second half of the time?
i dont know about keenan but asher seems willing to fly
<@!155893986605793281> pls reply
well not if keenan is there
but it might be kind of weird if asher and I are inside
yeah you can watch outside
the only problem is that i would think it would be kind of a waste for you to get a midweek ticket if you can only come like that thursday or wednesday at the earliest
i dont think things have to be completely final by tonight, we just need to have tickets tonight.
actual living arrangements and travel plans can be made much later in the coming months when you would know your schedule more for sure
but if we do, we could go ahead and buy a ticket for you and plan on you going, and if you dont go we could always sell the ticket to someone else or make keenan go
first of all, i think it's unlikely to even get tickets unless we are fast and have no technical issues
midweek tickets cover the 7-10th and cost 100, and finals tickets cover 11th-12th and cost 200
TI is from mon 7th until saturday the 12th
well we would have to buy tickets tonight
or if that doesnt work out then just refund/sell all the tickets back
or we could always just go ahead and get a third ticket and try to find someone else to go with us later
if not then its useless
i wonder if hed even go if we bought his ticket
yeah <@!155893986605793281>
these tips
we can follow this https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/63dk0n/the_international_2017_ticketing_tips_and/
yea
I guess it doesnt hurt to at least try and buy tickets?
chances are we wont even be able to
because its where i might want to go to grad school
also part of me just really wants to explore seattle
i wouldnt even be greedy like the ebay scalpers so it would be failrly easy
because couldnt we technically buy tickets now and then refund them or sell them to someone else later
i wonder how much buying tickets is a commital
idk how much shed be interested in it though
yeah clara could come to TI instead of keenan or in addition to keenan which would make things even cheaper
oh so not the kiev major
isnt kiev during school though
it's definitely possible budget wise to keep everything under 1000
round trip plane tickets would cost around 400 dollars i think
which would only cost 100 dollars if he just got a ticket for the mid week games.
considering he probably wouldnt be interested in dota that much there's no reason for him to get a finals ticket
and the only way i think we could get keenan to go is to pay for his TI ticket
because otherwise lviving would cost 400 each
i think its only feasible financially with 3+ people
well i can fly for free and i know that doesnt really help you guys directly, but i could use what i would spend on a ticket to help pay for you
i did a quick search and it would cost approximately 270 per person (if we had 3) to live in an air bnb for 6 days in seattle
<@!125452744440938497> asher what are your thoughts
if ronald was our friend you could ask him
i just know its the california offices
i forgot
maybe san fransisco
I think at General Electric?
also keenan i think you would enjoy it more than you think
its too bad ronald's work doesnt end like a week sooner because then he could come straight from california
i just think it would be fun if possible
but im really not committed enough for that
perhaps
the reason i want three people to go is mainly to split the costs of living in air bnb or hotel
plus you dont even have to buy tickets to TI, you can watch outside on the grass
dota would be engaging if you learn it
its not the same
and to experience esports
to hang out in seattle with us
if we couldnt go for the whole thing, I think it would be best to go sometime during the week since those tickets are only 100  whereas the final two days are 200
keenan you should go
yeah ronald at best you would make it for one day of the finals
it would be way more affordable if we could split the cost of living between 3 or 4 people
what dates
like between what dates
ronald when are you working
and do so before 1 am
if we can get one more person to go we should actually try to plan it
asher would you ever want to go to TI
i thought you would be in california this summer
if ronald also went to TI i would go
tahts the same for me
but thats 6 days you have to pay for living as well
i guess considering its 300 for all 6 days its not bad
i still want to go to TI at some point but thats so much harder to plan because its a week long  and tickets cost like 300
i like adventures
oh yeah also im going for the adventure
weird
one would have been cheaper
doesnt matter just curious
did you get one bed or two
that too
im mostly going for a) the merch and b) to touch stan lee before you do
yay lets see valve
it will be cool to see famous people just because they are famous but for most of them i dont have any personal attachment to
i guarantee false
i dont care about any of the people unless they are dota players, melee players, or game developers
k
is that a wrestle boy
seems like a pretty surefire way to beat them
yeah there was that reddit post about how eg was 1-8 versus alch
yeah how do you even counter ewaver aghs
its crazy how burning is 3rd place in a major tournmanet
am now
he ded
i feel like those are the only developers putting heavy effort into game soundtracks
like my playlist is mostly jrpg's, nintendo games, or indie games
the amount of work the developers put into the soundtrack gives me an unbelievable amount of respect for the game
although im not sure if thats the final boss song or not i just know its one of the ending ones
they had all the devs sing that song
both the instrumental and vocal versions are good
this is still one of my favorite songs from the nier ost https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1lpWdU3GX0
those bells are awesome though
i think it is asher just a different video of it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbQVcYgzEVo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Wmv7e4PvrI
maybe we'll see
i figured it would be good for portability since i move between apartment and house
its not a cube but its just really short
yea i have a mini itx case
if i built a computer again or if i had the money i would have gotten one of those fully glass paneled cases
oh are you getting the window version
which case
but that orange looks really good
i usually just leave it on purple
i dont have built in LEDS like that but i put led light strips inside the case that i can change the color of
hopefully the soundcard will be worth it
that is really expensive though
i love the orange
mmmm sexy
i got one of the mini-ITX motherboards because they almost always have built in wifi and blutooth since they dont have the slots for those adapters otherwise
or it does work but i actually get better ping on wifi for some reason
i thought i would never use wifi on my motherboard but turns out thats my only option because i cant get the iu ethernet to work
thats cool
is that why they are better than the gpu
did you get your mobo and cpu on sale?
i5 is good
also asnwer my question
asher do you want to play dota soon
Are you getting ryzen?
At least you can upgrade the GPU later
Why
k
<@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362> anyone want to play dota?
why would i do that
no
Which was what
M when was the last
It can make up for however bad or good forces is
No you won't because sonic mania will be out and is good
It's funny how pvz is a team based shooter now
In dk they are getting blown up by fruit, in yl they are just talking about the main objective of the game
Yeah they should
It's not even good filler
The last part of the song
And the paigies part was clearly just filler
And the chorus is bad
Yes
And its the chorus youre allowed to repeat that
Which makes sense
All they can think about is the butter on their head
That's what a real zombie would say
That's why they are good lyrics
Zombies aren't smart people
There's butter on my head
Nthe lyrics that the zombies sing are amazing
I just like how the main chorus is there's a zombie on your long and then they show 50 partying there
It has better lyrics
How is that worse
I just hink they could've done better but the rap literally doesn't do anything positive or negative to my impression of the game
Also it's not like I care
Ik it's a bad parody
They do t even say begin to say walnuts a third time
No that's twice
Trash
Paigies in cagies was 5 times, walnuts peanuts pineapple shells was 2
Yl rap is just trash there's no good lyrics
That's just the chorus
Yl rap had to repeat so many things because it's only two characters vs 5
That's the only line they repeat
The pagies in cages, who'll set them free?
x10
They can be more creative
Yeah i can
I realize they both aren't designed to be masterpieces but the lyrics of dk rap are better and aren't repeated 10 tomes each like in yl rap
But the dk rap was actually good
I saw but it's not good
It has so many battle modes
That game will be the best Mario kart
Yeah
Yeah
Lol
i think this game is pretty close
yeah im going to watch DAC

what is (Men)
thanks
have you ever considered spelling out the p
keenan i have a question for you
I agree
thats basically just all of hollow knight
april 5th is a wednesday
im up at 6 every day anyway so its not really an issue for me
gotta be fast
why is that bullshit
april 5 10:45
uh no thanks
sounds like we need to take the history of video games course
it does when its a direct continuation of the story
but episode 2 was 2007
it looks like it
20 years from now im sitll going to assume every kid plays minecraft and i'll still be right
oh is that what they all play now
children wont ever have to until they make a minecraft 2
or maybe 2.8 is just a bigger remaster of 2 hence why we got +0.8 instead of +0.5
that would make sense based on the 1.5 thing
i thought 2.8 was a remaster of 2.5 but i could be wrong
👌
how long were they dating
and i love when devs do that
so much thought was put into the tiniest details
persona 5 nails the one thing i care most about video games, which is polish
that will take me way more
for an 80 hour jrpg?
persona5 looks amazing
i think i need a ps4
probably because its the fucking world select
this is a significantly shorter loop
this is a shitty bot
fuck
can you go to the world select screen
🎺 🎵 🎺 🎵 🎺 🎵
you need one of those male to male audio cables
ok im going to keep working just stay there please

GIVE ME THE SOUNDTRACK
ya
people these days
snake pass has been out for 3 hours and theres still no soundtrack up...
now wouldnt that be an adventure
guys what if we went to TI http://blog.dota2.com/2017/03/tickets-for-the-international-2017/
for some reason i always underestimate those teams probably because i havent been following the chinese scene very closely anymore
the chinese teams are doing surprisingly well at DAC
<@!125452744440938497> dota?
and then miyamoto just grew up on gardening and furniture rearrangement
they could do that but doesnt kojima own some of the rights
theres not even any story to self destruct
kind of sucks that the ending of such a critically acclaimed franchise has to go out like that
like he didnt want konami to make another mgs game
i just heard he purposely messed it up because he was leaving or something
i want that game just because of the art style
i also want octopath traveler information
because that game looks awesome
or just confirmation that it will be in english
i want dq11 soon
since it wont come out for another 2 years
its probably best if you forget about it
lol
who loved snakes
this is irrelevant but i like how snake pass was developed by a biology teacher
but nier also does this cool thing where they change the gameplay all the time throughout the game
i dont dont think nier is musou either from the game play ive seen
i can only think of bloodborne and darksouls right now but i know those games only have the gameplay in common not the universe
nier is like a spin off of the main drakengard series according to wikipedia and ashers lore here
ah i see its like the same series overall though
what relation do those games have to each other besides that though
asher the composer for drakengard and neir is the same
it will be a be a while before this is out anyway
although its good to see a reviewer rate the game for what it is.
ive noticed a lot of reviewers give even the best indie games 8/10s just because they need to reserve the higher scores for AAA titles for some reason
bold claim for an indie title
this guy calls it the best game so far this year
just on pc
not for console
https://www.destructoid.com/review-hollow-knight-427608.phtml
its not a menu its an exploratory hub
you know what i mean
galaxy just gives you a level select screen
but it still has the aspect where you have to find the levels
and there are like 3 places you can go to do very specific things
but in galaxy its small
also you can run around free in both the hub worlds of sm64 and sunshine
thats true but that dynamic causes it to be a lot different in feel than sunshine
but it fits closer with them than sm64 and sunshine
so they arent sequels but they are two distinct categories of 3d marios
i agree with that
like compare how the camera works in 64 and sunshine to how it works in galaxy and 3d world
and also bring up good points about how the camera is a lot different between the games
they describe a lot this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIIlrDQTDxw
i think whoever made that was miyamoto
not integrated into one big one
yeah but thats like a separate level
no in 64 you can race and shit
in galaxy the only things like that are on the hub planet
i think the main thing about 64 and sunshine is that there are npcs in the areas that you can interact with and things to do besides the main goal of getting the star
maybe im not describing it correctly but you must see the difference
ive played all of them
yes
whereas in sunshine theres a central hub that you access everythign from
but getting enough stars on one unlocks the next and so on
yeah
<@!125452744440938497> i can maybe in a couple hours when i finish grading
where in galaxy you just progress through the galaxy and get a star on each planet
like theres multiple main objectives in each area
but 64 and sunshine share the same core gameplay in that they are open world and there arent traditional levels
but one is linear and one is not
same as in 3d platformer
not the same gameplay
no mario has completely different movesets
no its not continuity based its gameplay based
but people have been waiting 15 for sunshine sequel
the last hf came out in 2007 people have only been waiting 10 years
yeah
checkmate
one is red
one is yellow
that two very different series right there

they released an official mario sequel chart
but it's a sequel ok
they dont even take place on the same planet
im pretty sure galaxy and sm64 are comp[letely different games
thats like calling age of empires 2 hd a sequel to age of empires 2
thats not a sequel
thats not the same
wats ds
still earlier than hf
half life was like 2007 or some shit
mario 64 hasnt gotten a sequal since 1996
nintendo could announce half life 3 switch exclusive for holiday 2017 and still no one would give a shit about anything but mario
true but i also think at that time no one will give a shit abotu anything except mario
yeah im sure thats going to be their system seller in the holidays...
they really should be marketing a lot more for their first actually switch exclusive AAA game
because based on that it lacks content
people arent going to buy that game based on the 5 minute demo
which is my point
more than 5 is all we know
in the 1 minute 1v1 demo
"indepth gameplay" of the same 3 stages and 5 characters
and it's spring
that shit is releasing in spring and we know nothing about it
even if they dont do a direct
they really do need a new Arms trailer though
lol
the switch announcment was literally the night before
like the pokemon ones were sometimes the day before
but yeah its weird that a big one like this wouldnt be announced
i think sometimes they were kind of random
they announced lucas for smash 4 on april first 2015
according to reddit
yeah twice actually
they already announced what would be in the dlc

its dlc though
whats the second thing though
eh
they also showed a substantial amount of gameplay the last time they showed it
oh sorry Grezzo
its by Grezzmo
thats first party though
yeah keenan but nintendo rarely drop games
but that was also the day of wasnt it
lol
and no one believed it
i think that disproves it
"Trials" is spelled wrong
what
yea
the person making up it probably put a lot of effort into it
still this leak is surprisingly detailed
more believable
that was the day of though
probably never
i dont ever know when to trust 4chan
https://boards.4chan.org/v/thread/371959439#371959439
probably just aleph-not like some pleb
there are multiple levels of infinity so i could easily make a god more powerful than even that
i like the concept of peaceful dragons way more than mean ones
i will at some point
which i literally never use
i dopped 1k on the lynel hat
ah
i might already have enough because i never use my materials
how much mon does that cost?
its a mutually beneficial scenario between little hylians and the dragons
its how they shed and get clean
im pretty sure they want you to shoot them
fine not broken but fastest
i think the most broken is snow bowling though
i never really pay attention to schedules or the clock
i was just hoping i would run into him at the right time
well that makes it a lot easier
because i know each of the three dragons have like 5 different spots they can be in, i just figured which one thery spawned in was random
set times of day?
also dont the dragons just appear in a certain area randomly
how much do they seel for
yeah but dragon is huge and always far away and his neck is never in the right place at the right time for me
because you have specifically shoot the neck
idk if you have any advice
and i need three to upgrade my champions shirt
its also hard to get a scale from faron's neck beard
top right in akkala
idk if you've been there but its pretty cool
then they wake up and zap
they are all dead until you steal the treasure
theres this one labrynth in botw btw thats has a basement of guardians
especialy with luminous stones
i could have totally seen some kind of luminescent mushroom caves in botw
looking at screenshots it looks pretty cool
like why arent the gorons living inside of the mountain like in oot
like inside a mountain or something
i thought that would have been so cool
my one dissapointment with the whole environment thing is that theres no massive cave region
ah yeah of course
bones is apparently a biome too
these dudes came up with 12 which is impressive
thats about all i got
and your water
your forest
your desert
you got your snow
personally i can only think of like 4 biomes
where it would feel new each time
im surprised they were able to come up with that many unique environements
i do like thought how each of the 12 towers is in a completely different biome
just a little bit
just like minecraft
but then still invent new ones whenever they feel like it
i like how they strive to be so realistic with the animals in each environment
ive seen one but havent piloted one yet
he could always be my hm slave
i would surf on his back every day
lol im nostalgic for prince sidon
ok i wont get the chance to play until then anyway
because even with speed potions it was hard to catch up to them
i spent literally 20 mintues trying to catch a reindeer for a shrine quest
because i dont want to sneak
i just run at them
catching horses and deer and fairies is my bane
i usually get too impatient for stealth
we'll see
lol
they have nice weapons ive heard
lol ill probably just kill all them though
i took so many screenshots of his text
bolson is definitely my favorite character
which you havent done
and also bolson and that whole sidequest
i think kilton is pretty bonkers
they say some crazy shit
i think most of the npcs are pretty humorous
what was in the very beginning
also its going to be hard for any divine beast to top the elephant and prince sidon
because they are fucking obsessed
my brother told me you have to distract the yiga with bananas
and one perfectly rectangle settlement in the very middle
i just like the desert and the sandstorms and how you can see a giant camel in the distance
i just activated the towers
no
i havent explored the desert yet but it looks so cool from above
that place is awesome btw
i just got to the gerudo but havent done it yet
3
what do you mean repossessed
at least 70
no
🚗 🏠
heh
idk theres always next new years
splatwon
they actually did miss a big opprotunity with spla2on
they are going to fuck it up even further
its going to be called smash5 i just know it
WTF NINTENDO
super smash bros, super smash bros melee, super smash bros brawl, super mash bros for WII U!!
also WTF IS UP WITH SMASH
no if you're going to introduce numbers halfway through you have to go back and rename the old ones
WTF NINTENDO
Theres mario karty 7 and 8 but no 1 2 3 4 5 6
it really bothers me that the mario kart series suddenly started using numbers for 3ds
you probably just shouldnt ever use numbers so it's easier to make spinoffs
but you have to keep it consistent
either you dont use numbers or you do
"battlefield one" smh
none of these fuckers seem to be able to do it
if i became a video game dev the first thing i would do is get numbering right
you just have to go for it
sure but the laws of video game series ignore what you can and cant do story wise
thats what im saying man, they should have ignored the fact that it was a trilogy and stuck with the numbering scheme and call it mass effect 4.
then it would have been good
usually when games are numbered and then suddenly stop being numbered, thats a bad sign
thats just the final product
but nope
i like how at first, when the early demo came out, people were like "these animations have to be in beta, and they'll definitely bea  day one patch for the final release"
especialyl when compared to past mass effect games
people are focused on the bad animation but apparently the script is trash as well
its like no mans sky but at least you can claim nms wasnt AAA even if it was still 60 dollars
for a AAA game in 2017, adromeda is kind of unacceptable
but he kind of has a point
it's a lot more brutal than most reviewers
i watched the dunkey video.
i thought it was pretty exaggerated but still funny
like in how much they are working with indie developers now
yeah their nindies presentation last month was evident of that
and those arent indie games but its true nintendo did publish those
it makes sense i just havent seen it happen
for some games they only publish though
well they do both
nicalis is the publisher
like snipperclips isnt even physical and thats as close to nintendo as you can get
nintendo does marketing and shit but i dont know if theyve ever helped something get a physical release
i dont know any indie physical releases that have outsourced to nintendo
but still it's their first physical release game
maybe nicalis is well enough off
i dont know what binding of isaac did
because nintendo isnt helping them there
and in the case of Rime which does have a physical release, they had to make it more expensive
unless nintendo is subsidizing some of it
nah most indie games dont have physical releases at all
but definitely other third parties could
im pretty sure nintendo wont
hopefully more ccompanies wont start doing this
i know and i dont like them for it
sure but i think thats one of the major draws of a cartridge system in the first place, is that they are fast enough to run the game directly off of instead of having to install it first like with discs
they are completely defeating the point of a physical game
switch cartridge sizes are more than enough space for it
but the game should be all on the cartridge
this is unacceptable http://nintendoeverything.com/lego-city-undercovers-packaging-mentions-needing-up-to-13gb-of-space-for-game-download-on-switch/
keenan did you ever beat nioh
its like me with pokemon in high school
this kid in my class literally is playing botw on his switch every day
the dudes a legend
lol
so Edmund McMillen made two games that were directly inspired by nes classics
isnt that game getting a sequel
da fuck
and theres even a captured princess too
I literally just realized
this completely changes how I view the game
the abbreviation for Super Meat Boy SMB is the same as for Super Mario Brothers
i just had a realization
woah
ok
Thanks is better than speed running

Apparently Platinum isn't the best at PC ports
If they ever will
I'm waiting until they fix the PC version before I get it because of these problems
Lol I read some user reviews where people were complaining that the first 30 minutes were too hard because you can't save and if you die you start over
probably took all the farm away from his team
sure
but DAAACC
hyrule has never looked so beautiful
85 hours in

the trailer seemed better than the batman v superman trailer
i didnt know aquaman was a part of this
will justice league be good https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cxixDgHUYw
I'm so excited for this
This is really cool https://nintendotreehouse.tumblr.com/
i'll forget about them by the time i play the game
I need everything translated to Minecraft screenshots before I can understand it
Brilliant
i can see it being a thesis
i watched the first 5 and then figured my time would be spent better in other ways
it is
actually i think i understnad
ive watched 5 videos and still dont understand this channel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJUmwWHtSHE
i want to but im too tired right now and have a lot of work to do in morning
lol
did you get me some hentai
all i care about is your Last of Us 2 impressions
DID YOU SEE THE PS5?!?!?
well you are gonig to have to show us the sign
is all of this to tell me that you left his boy on the plane
also where is ronald's boy
whats his present
the original kind of sucked
And also tp scrolls have a  longer cd so it's harder for people to rotate and def towers
So it's easier to push alone
No it's +2 armor per enemy hero around a tower
No but I think he was indirectly buffed by the split pushing buffs
I don't think there have been any truly broken heroes for a while
Look at shadow shaman though
They buffed bfury and his physical damage talent
But the bfury build is back i think
No more permaroot
Also they nerfed ember a lot
Bots are much more worth it to get early game
Bots are only like 50 though
70
Also tower armor scales the more people you have around it
80 sec tp cool down, mk in captains mode, moonshard can be used on allies now
There are so many memes in here
Yooo big dota update http://blog.dota2.com/2017/03/the-bladeform-legacy-update/
Lol np
No
https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/5y28fr/the_legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild_breaks/

I hope so
but guys when are we going to start a lego worlds server
the nier release is really overshadowing this lego worlds release
😦
i was a little confused at first why you were at the bts house
theres this guy in the background of the bts smash summit stream that looks like you asher
isnt party queue disabled anyway?
yes
good times
lol i remember when other games existed
It won't be English
There's a reason Tetris doesn't come out until april
No
They probably won't be in English though
Yeah
If you really wanted
You can still download it from the Japanese eshop
Not anything you'd want
Europe got some neo Geo games, a couple random shovelware games, and a touch screen only rhythm game also on phones
Three
Europe also got the same there
They like 3 more and they are all crap
Blaster master
I did i haven't had much time to play it yet though
Well they are like normal kids but I like then
Especially the kids
Lol all the NPCs are great
What do you think
I'm playing with the kid
I need to strengthen my body with a diet made entirely of swift carrots apparently
Well in the shrines that doesn't happen on purpose
What's collision grab
Lol
I haven't heard much voice acting yet
Higher
It's like previous Zelda games but high quality
I also love the voices of the npcs
Literally mgs
Keenan you can attach balloons to stuff
I was struck because I went near a metal spear on the ground
They have dad jokes
Omg i love the little kids at the dueling peak stables
Is it above/below you?
You might have to solve some puzzle to reveal them
Idk
He was a cute little rock
I found stone talus in the plateau
Stone talus or someone else
I want their drops
Have you killed any of them?
No
Stamina seems more useful for any boss fights where you just need to run in circles
It's also cool how they make you trade off between stamina and health
That and the upgrades
They are also a good way to pass the time when it's thunderstorming
What kind
They always run away
Do you know if you can get foxes
I keep wanting there to be a mid air double jump but am disappointed
Although links jump is a little too realistic.
As soon they add jumping in a Zelda game i keep expecting it to be more like mario
I like the puzzles involving physics balls
Is it in Hyrule field
No but my brother mentioned it i think
Idk
Each of them are really cool
I only recently got the shrine detector though
Like 8
O need to complete all them
I also want all the shrines
Oh good maybe I should go to one of them cities eventually
Do you know how to use korok seeds to expand your inventory?
I heard they can be used for that but idk how
So I just got to beat the camp twice
While I was standing in the middle of a camp
Oh I had one of those already
I'm too conservative with my items to craft a stealth food
Or a deer
I still can't find figure out how to ride a goat
I'm taking on one area at a  time very slowly
I have over ten hours in but most of it has been fucking around and not progress
Almost to kakiriko
It would be pretty dumb if they got rid of it
Also asher I really don't like how much Reddit hates ranked parties
I think that time includes both Zelda and snipperclips
It good?

im gonig to have to use the parental controls app to keep track of my playtime until nintendo adds a real tracker
my mom just made a real insightful comment "this kind of looks more like a playstation"
The dope sound effects almost make up for the no music
#phoneapp
Oh I was going to at least play it first before the taste ruined all fun I could have with the game
Not asher
I'm going to bed but it does feel like some premium shit
I'm going to bed but it does feel like some premium shit
We are leaving now.
Are there a lot of people
9:30
ronald get an electric skateboard
i thought it was just hit gently in the wheel
i'll let you decide
depends on the terms of the contest
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lvm0of3iDUU
idc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWqhXWRaMmU
or maybe taht slide was just some sort of passive aggressive comment
my professor for that class just assumed we werent idiots adn that "believing in something" is never a requirement for any test or subject
i cant beleive they even have to make that statement
what class is this
lol
damn dont you just hate it when a class just ends on you like that
yeah its like that game i showed you
cool i will follow her
do they make it themselves?
they have some nice art
thats from polygon right?
dont forget
snipperclips will be 10/10 too
yea
not baby or joycon rotate
although some of the more theatrical games seem fun to watch as a spectator
yeah
bold claim
"Even alcohol couldnt save 12 switch"
a lot of sites did
theres only like 2 online games atm anyway
theres no doubt it will be refined later
they just added those things quickly j ust to have something at least functional for launch
but i also think the whole  online thing wont be finalized  until summer
even he wasnt prepared
lol
there needs to be a new award category for "taste"
i was really hoping people would take of points on their botw reviews because the cartridges taste bad
which is hilarious
no but you can play neo geo games
he learned about the high demand by the fact he couldnt find a new wii *anywhere*
i bet ronald is going in NC too but he'll be looking to buy ones of those new "wiis"
its going to be below freezing and possibly snowing lol
yea
it's really going to drive those wii u sales

i thought they were just normal figures
oh right
why woulfd some one come to a game store to buy a dory figure
to resell?
do you even accept that?
what?
apparently it actually tastes like insecticide or something
http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14778316/nintendo-switch-cartridge-taste-test-dont-lick-it
wtf nintendo flavored the switch cartridges to taste terrible so kids dont eat them
It's pretty cool how all the indies that were announced today are ready and playable at GDC
an ovewrwatch comic collection woudl also be cool
i just thought it was neat
no

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=samulGnaDVg
if it was only indie titles it still be great
basically like humble monthly bundle but not limited to 6-8 games each month
i want steam mainly
thats what i hope
and it's at a really good price point too
well aside from your isolated experience, ps now only does streaming.
so it's really cool to finally see a subscription game service that lets you download  full games
it could have been just a ps+ thing
and i can guarantee you that my pc is not running a full ps3 emulator via ps now
alright but not my pc
and pretty superior to anything else out right now
whatever keenan the point is that it's cool
for my windows 10 pc
which is requesting that i enroll in a free trial
not according to their website
the fact that ps now supports devices other than the ps4 is evidence of streaming only
at least not with ps now
i dont think you have
i cant find any source on being able to play the games offline
everywhere mentions it as a streaming service
keenan im pretty sure its onlyt streamin
they will still be adding more games im sure
also it's new
not halo 5
streaming makes a huge difference
this xbox thing is full downloads
its also streamed
but its also twice as expensive and only ps3 games
oh yeah ive seen that
link?
yooo this is awesome http://news.xbox.com/2017/02/28/introducing-xbox-game-pass/

it has raving reviews
“Looks pretty sweet!” BioWare Creative Director
i'd recommend it too
must be good if it has an original soundtrack
hmmmmmmmmmm
An original orchestral soundtrack by composer Trent Moriarty
i didnt realize nintendo sent him a switch but thats cool
https://twitter.com/SethBling/status/836302637716819969
i dont think you can employ the children though
ya
or tend to your animals
they also are good for making babies
they occassionally give you food, other items, water your crops, or fix your fences
thats what your spouse is for
well the brakes on the hype train never stop
but still why do they need them
pokemon day?
why
first i got to beat mario
lol k
otherwise i would get too frustrated
i could only speedrun a really convenient game to speedrun
its key for me
plus it's the first zelda game where you can more than 3 save files which is key for speedrunning
theres also no tutorial shit and very little cutscenes you would have to sit through at the beginning of each attempt
yeah thats why it woudl be nice
as in practiced doing it myself
it would be pretty funny if i got really into botw speed running
i will watch after midterms
the youtube channel is pretty cool
wtf
this cracks me up
lol
is that really what it is
keenan that one instrument is back
im proud
this guy is ripping it from the leaked game files which dont exactly have track names
i think the titles are guesses or mostly unknown but sure
goron city
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCfFOLSKwnI
is it too soon to enter hype mode?
otherwise this would be completely normal
too bad vine is dead
pokemon eclipse incoming

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Dbt_M3rKkQ
just wanted to get that out there so you can watch me be right tomorrow when it's officially announced
just a hunch
i bet yooka laylee is a switch a launch title
If they release a version of smash with all the dlc included for the switch, they might be waiting until then to debut the amiibos as well
That's what I heard last
I think so
?
https://twitter.com/Dystify/status/836291752155807744
apparently usain bolt is now a team skull member
meaning youve survived the fight long enough to be worthy of hearing it
i love how the real "melody" only kicks in after 1 minute
i love the strings
this also reminds me of legendary battle music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLOid6eCwFM
but poster man
because i cant seriously play anything until after my morning classes friday anyway
but then i heard about the posters
i originally was going to be too lazy to go to the midnight release even
thats worth it imo
so even if you cant get a console you can buy some joycons or zelda and get the poster
you get a zelda poster for going to the midnight launch
i was planning to drive there from home
i mean i have a preorder and i was going to get there around 11
they were confirmed to have extra non-preorder units
yeah you can come if you want
keenan im going to the midnight release at bestbuy
nd animal crossing
i think the lady who did spirit tracks and smash 4
he just advises
kondo hasnt done the music since oot
no
there and in gen 7
and some of the battle themes
it reminds me a lot of pokemon black white ost
unknown title #2 is my jam
me too buddy
lol
i posted it yesterday but no one cared
and my good earbuds broke right before this came out so now i have to listen to it with shitty ones or wait until i get home

LEAKING AS I SPEAK
WE GOT THE SOUNDTRACK BOYS
no
yes

ok
only a little
anyone want to hear a cool tune
if you can fly inside the tube, then yes
im mlg at those
you have to take the sky tube
and i literally mean remove all the ground so you cant walk
thanks
can we build a minecraft world where the only form of transport between our bases is via sky tubes
ok
<@!127535721857679362> <@!125452744440938497> anyone want to play some doata
i just forgot
you already told me
<@127535721857679362> <@125452744440938497> I can play dota soon
Not for us.
But if you were explaining our emotes to someone, they would see all of our faces and then random old dude
I love the fact the face of a random guy is an emote on this server
<:preciousboy:234377704261156865>
There was a two hour period where I could play
I can't now
Poor tomorrow corp trying to make the switch launch:
“We hope we can make it!
We're still just 3 people, trying to launch 3 games on March 3rd — and it's going to be close.
For reference, the Zelda team has approximately 2.9 billion people and a really fast horse, but we're close behind.
Save some champagne for us, Nintendo, we're going to be bloody and tired and maybe not all 3 of us will make it alive, but we're going to get there, and the games will be stunning!”
<@!127535721857679362> <@!125452744440938497> if anyone wants to play dota let me know

is a jrpg not made by a japanese studio still a jrpg


Yea



and interviews
like sketches
there's definitely stuff thats exclusive though
but its not the same




ugh i love every single one of these characters

books plus the best magazine cover you'll ever see
maybe it was just because i returned that particular book pretty late
classic amazon
lol
for shipping
no the last time i returned something i had them deduct 5 dollars off the full price i got for the return
they are you just have to pay for shipping like i said
you just have to pay for shipping or deduct the shipping cost from the return
amazon will return it for full price
"ehh art books are usually pretty large and heavy"
i even thought the package it came in was unusually heavy
yeah i know its just work
and then another pre order in januarary and i had forgotten about my previous pre order
i placed a pre order in november
i accidentally ordered two zelda art books
fuck me
LOL
A.robot that uses smiley faces is all you need to pass the Turing test
Because everyone knows a robot can't use smiley faces
Smiley faces are how you make yourself seem more human

amazon support is the best despite my petty and impatient issue
brings it up like every other time i meet with him
i also fell out of my chair in class a year ago and he still makes fun of me for it
just to fuck with them
even though they submit identical work
for lab assignments he might give one partner a 99.99 and the other a 99.98
lol the professor i have likes messing with people by making their grades 99.99/100
ugh i hate when there's a good soundtrack but the loops are only 45 seconds to a minute long
reminds me of this https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1576389298/nintendo-switch-dog-tongue-stickers-for-joy-con
you cant see the eyes in this one
idk i like the first one because of his eyes
i like the kk one because its something that someone who plays the game would recognize, but someone who doesnt would just think it's a normal dog sticker
the second one still looks like him but it coudl also easily look like a some miner dude with a hammer
maybe the first one since it's more recognizeable as dedede
i cant decide
fuck
i thought that was just the bad guys
does snake actually ever do !
that one is pretty cool
or maybe its just that face on the sticker
i think seeing him in the game like that would also bother me
mentally
like it bothers me
for some reason i find that really unappealing
or get those stickers that you can move
i need to figure out where to put stickers
did the mega man stickers inspire you
and cheat in your drawings
then you can trace them
but yeah thats basically furniture
or on the back
like behind where you put the paper
furniture

ok
anyway i was just considering post game as optional content beyond the main story, similar to side quests.
not a continuation of the main story with a narrative shift
alright it doesnt matter what exactly happens in metal gear it was just another example
that happened in luke cage and daredevil
im just giving another example of a common narrative shift
im not talking about broken steel
yeah it's like when you spend half the game fighting one bad guy and then half way through you switch to a new badder bad guy
but ultimately you just group it all together as one campaign
most games dont do a lot of weird things metal gear does
just say its a long campaign
then whyd you say it was so amazing to have so much post game
thats like not even optional content
thats barely post game then
you mean 45 hours campaign plus 35 post game
nah i think what i said is very reasonable
you are way too defensive about metal gear
post game is very similr to side quests
when you count side quests and post game
average open world content length is much longer
which is mgsv
no i think average open world campaign lenght is around 40 hours
xenoblade
well maybe where mgsv has 40hrs of campaign, and 40 hours of post game, other games just have 80 hrs of campaign
maybe not when that content happens in regards to the overall story
the amount of content is normal
*normal open world game
wow it's almost like it's a normal game
Look at the future guys https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/switch-cart-2.jpg

ANYONE WANT TO PLAY DOTA
No it doesn't but you have to be from Bloomington
you wouldnt understand
they could be the cover demons
probably like m
although i doubt those games are actually e10
im pretty sure ESRB cant actually play through the whole game, so the devs just tell them key points and they tactfully leave out the part about the penis


i didnt realize that green penis appeared in previous games
<@!125452744440938497> heres an analysis of demons for you https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwgk_GC8Q3U&feature=youtu.be&a
im going to sleep soon
i will tomorrow though
i cant today because i dont have my computer

 @Cyborgmatt: That new Stormcharge Dragoon set for Disruptor though!
https://t.co/Um2wceoedV
i love me some leaks
https://vid.me/oQkO
so does any desktop manufacturer
but i think they are slowly being replaced by chromebooks
lenovo already is really high in terms of licensing their products to big companies and schools
i dont think they are marked up a ton
similar to the nexus line
the motorola phones have always been really good for the price
well im sure apple and samsung have huge premiums
thats almost 3 years old
my brother is still using my original moto x
yeah its a good phone although i had a different moto x than asher

SOMEONE HAS A SWTICH ALREADY
you're lucky you arent reading the captions of these images like i am
do you think ronald understands yet

lol it was just on the wiki




so id guess netlfix would put the second season up right before the third
they put up the frist season right before the second season premiered
and that was last year
the first season is
mr robot was free ofr the first season
amazon does weird things
shouldnt season 2 be on netflix now
it was a year ago
i dont remember
i think i watched season 2 on amazon
i did ronald but idk when season 3 is out
no the witcher did
it probably goes on sale for the same price fallout 4 does
this is a game mor eon a the scale of fallout
*except stardew
the rest are like 3 hours each
this is a different kind of game than the ones i sent you
why the fuck is it 20 for a demo
i think the 20 dollar one is fake
idk theres this thing called mgsv: phantom pain with is 40 and theres this other thing called mgsv: ground zeroes which is 20
mgsv is on steam
"Valley of Geldo"
the japanese to english names of the songs are funny

but it comes with some cool thingies
yeah...
should i buy this https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-30th-Anniversary-Concert/dp/B01N2SZOX4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1487183128&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=Zelda:+30th+Anniversary+Concert+Limited+Edition+C&linkCode=sl1&tag=dystify-20&linkId=e2effce66b06d15917bf24b4d6fecdb6
it's not complex
i mean thats the recipe was in paper mario
i dont think so
poor mario
tldw: it's disgusting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j20Mw-jgbxk
lol
its weird
why
wtf ultra street fighter 2 has a first person mode
<:preciousboy:234377704261156865>
<:preciousboy:234377704261156865>
what is your soundtrack
This complexity vs onyx game is megas vs megas right now
i can see why you might think that
no but i know what it's like
huh
i think that can only be on purpose
so solutions are public?
fallout does have really good setting
yeah i noticed that
i thought fallout was one of your favorite series though
i was playing the witness and that game has very little polish
and polish
i realized yesterday i care a lot about minor details
better than bethesda?
whats the level of polish like
its also really hard for me to say why fallout or skyrim didnt keep my attention
do you think mgsv would hold my attention more than fallout new vegas or skyrim
so ronald would like it
it just seems like an easy comparison
fallout 4 isnt even the best fallout game from what ive heard
is that relative to each other or absolute
it only has about a 1-couch radius
which is why the wii u gamepad didnt suffice
sometimes i have to switch couches
and i keep doing that
just like my dog
i just pick a spot for 30 minutes then i switch to a new spot
you should see how i do homework
but in like 100 different positions
most of the time i play my 3ds it's just at my house
i just like portable consoles because im not capable of sitting in the same spot on a couch for more than 2 hours
also the switch is barely bigger than the 3ds xl
i dont think portable is your thing aside from playing games at work
k
why
well also by december there will be a pretty big jrpg library on swithc
the ps vita is a real good emulation machine though
you barely paly any of the jrpgs available for 3ds
you have a 3ds
its just indies that you can get on pc or jrpgs that you can get on ps4
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetFront
Most things do work on the 3ds/Wii u browser though since they are built on netfront which is a variation of webkit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8mfLsrcD6k
thats my first line of defense
i thought everyone did that
i accidentally just spent 14 minutes listening to the nioh loading screen theme
but people didnt expect monkey king support
a couple days ago they voted to ban all supports
he was picked in another game as a support and he owned that one too
for valentines day, people voted to ban all the female heroes
so by game 3 in a best of three, there are like 40 heroes remaining and they are usually shitty ones
the community hero votes on 10 heros to ban each day, and after each game in a series, the heroes that were picked or banned are also banned for the next game
elimination mode
on the same team
complexity picked a techies and a monkey king
https://www.twitch.tv/moonducktv
literally zelda
the only things i have on my wall are serious things
i think i'll probably frame at least one fo them, i have to decide which looks cooler
what do you mean never post them
two different ones
im gonig to have two botw map posters that i hvae to decide what to do with
im excited for you
i wish more companies released official map comparisons
tahts pretty cool
😦
well that onlien person is dumb
take a screenshot like a cultured person
doesnt the ps4 have a share button
i cant see shit
?>
i wonder if they'll let you try games taht arent released yet
do people not like frank
who is frank
the only game im good at is minecraft
for what game
lol
who is that
this is a cool poster
you can too
if you have a working one of those
although im pretty sure this game could run on a potato
cool
direct download: https://dl.humble.com/numbernone/The_Witness_Installer_v964.zip?gamekey=6v3zBnNwrs8Xn2hE&ttl=1487122882&t=3c8e3afdee171acaa1a5483b82fd843b
i can give you link
no its drm free
yeah
there is no precedent for major updates though
yeah those were bug fix updates
also when pc gets multiplayer i dont know if it will be cross platform
the dev only develops for pc, and other people port to the consoles for him
but the updates come out a lot slower since it's just one dev
and pc will probaly get those updates first
but it gets continuous updates just like minecraft
yeah
he likes those city sims where you just build stuff
thats actually really useful
damn this bundle comes with an R textbook
he likes similar games
And an emphasis over that economy rather than an emphasis on building
Ronald would probably like Stanley parable though
Stardew is 2d and the opposite of hyper violent
It's not mine either but I still own it lol
I'm just excited to try the ones i haven't heard of before
Super meat boy and world of goo for example are games everyone should own
Also these aren't "random" games
But the DRM free version will just be like a zip file
It is
Past humble bundles
So I can give the copy to someone
I already have it
I have no clue why the witness is DRM free.
That's a 40 dollar game
Yeah
I'd give it to you for free but Keenan already asked for it
Lol I was just saying the only games I really want from this are the witness, sproggiwood, rockets, and Subnautica
I have more than 5
If you played similar mobile games
Day of the tentacle is a really high rated point and click game from the 90s that you might like
A lot of these games are really good or well knwon
Same with VvVVvv and super hexagon
World of goo, super meat boy, and Stanley parable are like 5 bucks each but also classics
And stardew is 15
Considering the witness itself is 40 bucks
English confirmed.
No it's a min of 30 this time because it's 4 times the size of a normal bundle and for a special occasion
The games are either steam keys, DRM free downloads, or both
So essentially all the developers/authors of the games and books in this bundle are donating them
But this one is an especially big bundle that all goes to charity
Usually you can choose what you want to pay from 1 dollar and beyond and then how the money is distributed amongst charity and the drvelopers
You just buy it and get the games
I'll peer review your essay
I feel like I'm just a lot looser than you in terms of genres.
I'm about in the middle on a scale from "Keenan" to "everything is literally Skyrim"
When are you going to write your dissertation on video game genres
Also you might be able to upgrade your hair in shantae i just haven't gotten there yet
ori also has one directional attacks and its a metroidvania
shantae is more similar to a metroidvania than to a platformer like shovel knight
i dont think it's hurting anything to classify other similar games in it
thats an awfully small category then
they cant just be clones
not every metrooidvania is going to be exactly like metroid or castlevania
i think it's pedantic and ultimately doesnt matter because the games have similar gameplay
but that small distinction is the only thing that prevents you from saying it's a metroidvania
they could have easily combined all the levels into one continuous thing
you have to backtrack all the time after you get new abilities
it does
that is what shantae is
i dont see how you think shantae isnt
but shantae is not like shovel knight at all
yes
it has all hte same qualities
it literally is
but they are still metroidvanias
in the other games i mentioned you can only attack forward though
yeah
or ori
like shantae
one direction
you can attack in all four directions
its very smooth
i really like the combat
i agree i dont think it's trying to be darksouls i just thought it reminded me of that
it's kind of a depressing game
it's pretty cool
hallow knight is no different either
they seem that way
no
i just think the themes in the game remind me a lot of darksouls
not because it's difficult
yeah
i think that game is the dark souls of metroidvanias
that you can run on windows
it's just a zip file
also keenan do you want me to send you the hallow knight demo?
but of some of it i just dont understand
some of it is good own its own
or banjo kazooie
i want to play doom only so i can appreciate its ost
i do find that in other osts though
but it's not like it's bad on its own
it ofc means more after you've played it
gerudo valley is legendary
so i think you're wrong
also my dad occasionally watches me play zelda and he really likes the gerudo valley music even though he has no idea what it mean
that way you can actually see if it's good on its own
before and after
theres nothing wrong with doing both
instead they just kill the dudes and then the music would go away
even during boss themes
but no one ever does
like when you open the menu you can hear the music without the battle sounds
in all the gameplay footage of botw ive seen, i always get pissed that while fighting enemies they never pause to listen to the battle music without sound effects
i can actually see myself spending considerable time studying the textures on some rocks
fair point
they have hero mode for that
zelda is not one of the series i try to make harder on myself
you arent better you are just not as deliberate
you also dont play video games properly
its going to take you way longer than some store playtime to beat it
this is different because its new
but for the witcher i didnt have any rush to get through the story
i mean you have a point, i did stop playing the witcher after 15 hours
botw will be no different
also part of the reason i beat it so fast was because i wanted to finish the story so i could look at the internet again
i spent some time catching rare dudes that i thought were cool
60 actually
idk keenan i beat pokemon in 5 or 6 days
the only reason im taking so long to beat the other games because is because i play them like 3 hours every week
spring break is like two weeks after it comes out
thats not true
hows that not fair
i'll get it and play it through at the same time you get botw
i will at some point im sure
im pretty sure odyssey is going to be a tf2-esque hat simulator
yeah sure, but i havent bought it yet
im probably going to get it, 100% goes to charity this time.
but there are a lot of games i already have so if anyone doesnt get it and wants the codes, let me know
https://www.humblebundle.com/freedom
lol i got a point of extra credit for drawing a diglett on my latin quiz
where shit that happened in lego batman would appear in the comics and othe rbatman movies later on
yeah so i though you meant the other way around
oh i see now
i thought that meant all of batman
oh you said just everything is canon
im not i dont understand
that seems a little shady
are they in a position to say its canon in all of the batman universe
who are the writers
who determined that it was canon
what do you mean its canon
in the same movie
how can there be more than one batman
to have every batman ever?
how is that a thing that makes it good
whats the benefit
how does it have every batman ever
thats all it sad
"every batman ever"
these dont make sense
"vehicles"
oh even better
just what i was hoping
ah yes "gadgets"
does that have spoilers
or sometimes i see something as im scrolling down but hten it dissappears
sometimes it randomly shows a tweet from 20 hours ago without any indication why
im not just talking about what stuff was recently liked or popular
no curation
i just want a direct feed of the latest
i dont want that shit
and showing me different tweets each time i refresh
it's turning into facebook
fucking twitter
i think they add a new level everyday
it's pretty good
did you beat it
dude have you played it
10/10
fun gaemplay
music
cutscenes
great story
amazing graphics
the google doodle game is better than sonic

<@!127535721857679362> when can you play dota
you can try restoring to an earlier restore point and if that doesnt work it's probably hard drive
if you can get to repair mode you can always try reverting to a previous version of windows.
the other day my computer was freezing and getting blue screens and it turned out it was just some driver problem with a recent windows update
ad finem just picked monkey king in elimination mode
whats wrong
im bored and dont want to do work
<@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362> yo someone should play dota with me
One of my favorite pieces from X/Y
This is amazing
https://youtu.be/spvyA14V4x4
:(
you should play for honor with me, it's free for one more day
i dont want to play overwatch

well i beat the hallow knight demo

crazy
thats liek 1.75
how many america bucks is that
i dont think much else is aside froom game titles
i mean titles of games are
thats interesting
i honestly wonder why it's english
idk it still looks like it has english on the pipe
isnt that available in the u.s.
though
oh ok i thought it would be where the hq
wheres the museum then
but thats where nintendo is
or all
or both
or somewhere else
are you going to tokyo or kyoto
i cant right now
how much do people speak englihs in japan
and also that lifesize ditto
of different pokemon
i really want those ditto plushies
dude you havent even been to japan yet
sorry
no but i know what you're talking abotu
we should buy those real life z-ring bracelets
i dont really like the gen 1 pokemon
do they have newer vesions of those
idk why iwould need that
no
but half of it is just a pokedex
i mean just a guidebook
i hope the sun/mmoon has 800
the emerald one i have has all 400 pokemon at the time in it
i might have that around somewhere
although i doubt the sun/moon one has all 800 pokemon in it
because they are just physical pokedexes
those are awesome
i need to buy one of the newer pokemon guidebooks
but i just dont know why so many people want it so soon
i mean i'll probably buy it eventually since it will probably have a useful item dex with stats and stuff
is it that much of a collectors item though that it becomes best selling
then you just have a guidebook on how to beat a sucky game
what if the game sucks
yeah but its not like the limited editions that you need to buy immediately
i love how people buy guidebooks without even playing the game yet
did you see how the botw official guide book is already the best selling book on amazon right now
thats the point right
its multiplayer right
cool
<@!127535721857679362> are you going to play dota tonight
i thought that green thing skips to the end
why wouldnt it just become any% at that point
because with that orb thing, arent you technically bypassing some of the levels
i dont understand how people still can use glitches in the 11-gates category
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USBboeK7oDA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdFANohrP28
we can tonight if you want
looks like it has really cool level design but the gameplay seems bland
no
its probably not worth it
well actually it would be a two day thing since it starts at 7 am next sunday
does anyone want to go to chicago and play the switch
Yeah I want to play dota and tp today but I'll at least download it to see what its like
lol
I don't know why it wouldn't be
Looks like it has really cool combat
Can't you get it on ps4 and we can play "together"
But it's free so why not
It's free right now though so i might as well try it
No.
It's also peer to peer servers which is pretty shit
It's literally just overwatch but with swords
Guys let's play for honor tonight
but they arent avengers!
wtf the guardians of the galaxy of going to be in infinity war
genre I suck at ☑
amazing artstyle ☑
amazing soundtrack ☑
hallow knight meets all my criteria for a good game
CHRISTOPHER LARKIN THE LEGEND
i think you must be time traveling
there's like no press on it
this game is super underated
its better
WATCH THIS ONE
but i think they tweeted this trailer only an hour ago
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THINGS
HOW
how did you watch it
but it jsut came out today
it's new
watch that trailer
okay this is the game im most hyped for this year that im alst most likely to suck horribly at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAO2urG23S4
it might be hard to play for a new person but its not that hard
i also think ori and the blind forest is really cool to show someone who is new to games
the only mechanic is riding but its not even necessary
there are no actual mechanics in abzu you just swim and look at the pretty fish
abzu
to show her first
anyway i think there are better stylistic games
i think it's about havinga journey
yeah i watched you
a tutorial that doesnt have any text
i also think it would bhard to play that game/know what to do unless you are already familar with games
i dont mean not good as in bad i just mean not good for an introduction
journey is not a good game unless you understand games already
i dont get the point
you should show her either wii sports or some super stylized game
whats wrong with how they look
which is 10x better
yeah or wii sports resort if you have that
wii sports
or to introduce her to gaming
just to have fun
whats the goal
rekt
theres that mansnion in gen 4 that you can only get past at night when the guards are asleep
pokemon also did day/night stealth differences first
#pokemondiditfirst
yeah because a 2d sprite cant be fully rendered
masuda is in like every pokemon game
omg
idk why you're laughing
ly
serious
stealth is a major component
im talking about botw
zelda
You know what else has that mechanic
idk it seems like mgs is already your favorite game ever
cant you just go invisible
i still dont understand how stealth works in bethesda games
and theres a ton of completionist stuff i didnt do
i thought it was a really nice length
thats only a 15 hour campaign
you should play link between worlds
i really want to get into more jrpgs but they are just so damn long
i think it's good i just cant justify the price unless it's a retro game that i can get for cheaper anyway
oh ok
i thought you already thought that
you realized shorter is good?
what happened to you
i wanted to play xenoblade but then i heard the campaign was 70 hours
although more and more im starting to appreciate games with shorter campaigns because i dont have a lot of time if it's not during a break
i could probably spend 40 dollars on that game
oh thats pretty good
how long is the campaign?
i like the ost the best
lol
i thought he was just like a dumb version of samus
i never played snake in brawl
i knew it was a trademark but i onl thought it was for the recent game
is that also the one where you hide in boxes
is that an mmorpg oor something
dont you like attach balloons to fallen enemies to add them to your collection
why are there base building mechanics
because there seems to be many more and more variety than in wind waker
but im excited for the role koroks will play
well of course who doesnt love gorons
they are like pokemon
i love the idea of koroks
it's like a korok elder or something
https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p180x540/16601659_1309754115752382_4412959903455905136_o.png?oh=7936ef729f0fec833cf600140b58b5ae&oe=5949F331
maybe you just designed a random npc
lol
it's probably to appeal to the more western style of character customization
ive never done that before
when it comes out on youtube im literally adding every song to my list
it was just released today
you need to listen to this btw https://christopherlarkin.bandcamp.com/album/hollow-knight-original-soundtrack
idk probably nioh
oh i couldnt tell from the gameplay
im also not sure if you get longer in snake pass but maybe
it looks like rattle and roll also has a jump button
the screenshots look like frogger
it's just like frogger
im looking up rattle and roll too
nintendo owns both what?
but they clearly took a lot of inspiration from rare
i dont think anyone working on snake pass is from rare besides david wise
rattle and roll is the spiritual predecessor
the reason i think snake pass will be really cool aside from the composer is that it's a 3d platformer without a jump button
wise does any jungle-themed game
they are both platformers
yeah what about it
anyway im hyped because its the same composer as FTL
or ive only just now heard about it on ipads
they are just now bringing it to ipads i think
maybe eventually but that studio is only two guys
I WANT https://vimeo.com/203014674
http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-02-10-mass-effect-fans-really-want-to-sleep-with-alien-jaal
yeah but its like 15 degrees outside and i need to bike
do those even exist
every week my stock gets lower
goddamnit i keep running out of socks
a couple years ago beffore i had an ssd, dota would take like a minute to boot up, but they've really improved loading times since then
but i can tell you that i can boot up dota and load into a game i disconnected from in 15 seconds
i dont know how long fallout loading would take on my ssd
yeah loading times do seem like they would be really long
but i think it has much higher textures/graphics by default
65 gb without any texture pack
still not as big as the witcher 3
lol
yesss ok i have to get this game now http://www.snake-pass.com/news/2017/2/9/announcing-david-wise
not the solid kind of snake
David Wise might be the composer and if so I'm super hyped
Oh do you know about that snake game?
It's not really about zelda
Well do it
Keenan did you see that interview
ok
but it's over
playing what?
?
yeah i dont have any class in the same building as another
i bike
i dont walk
i havent played much this week
same as before
fucking junior things
my favorite
thats 5 pounds of water
fuck latin
except for latin
my trick is to exclusively take classes i like
yeah i was thinking about it
junioritis
thats bad for your homework
you shoudlnt
thats good
every time i play a video game i need to be fully immersed
you need to practice being fully immersed in everything, no multitasking, including video games
F stands for Fterrible
then F
if i dont do it
i wake up 5 hours before something is due
but who knows mario kart is like the biggest system seller so it might even be more out of stock
in a month mario kart will be out anyway
yeah or that
youd have to go right when stores open if you want any chance
that would be even better than using it and then sending it back
i dont know if you've noticed but keenan still has a SNES that works
especially between refurbished and new
there's no difference when it comes to game consoles
here you go ronald https://store.nintendo.com/ng3/us/po/browse/productDetailColorSizePicker.jsp;jsessionid=e70kjJyM-wXf6hCOQNn__ROIVYvASwHg0LsACJCOhUIDziFAdaVt!785549575?categoryNav=true&navAction=jump&navCount=0&atg.multisite.remap=false&productId=prod150200&categoryId=cat550278
we are talking about the wii
this is the same man who couldnt find a new wii on sale anywhere
size doesnt matter
but probably not you
i think i might be able to pass
then i have to get back
i only have time for one 2 hour movie
nah i dont have time
i'll fly over there right now
ronald do you want to go see lego batman with me
ronald thats not relevant to this conversation
is that even a thing
lol
no
team ninja
fine
also is this the first koei tecmo game thats not hack and slash
its definitely more white than the blond hair i have
it's blondish
fine
like gestalt levels of cool
thats cool
also the guy on the cover has white hair
it just seems a lot darker
darksouls is definitely a cool world
it looked like it had cool oceans and ships
i like the world more
it just does
it just does
it seems like a game i would like a lot more than dark souls
yeah i heard that game has really cool stamina mechanics, and you can tell they focus on it because you can see the enemy's stamina meter
making something more japanese automatically makes it a ps4 exclusive
and ps4 exclusive
i was going to listen to that but i guess i'll just have to settle for diddy kong racing
it baffles me why people have extended versions of the nioh soundtrack up on youtube before the normal versions
lego batman
guess what comes out tomorrow
guys
lol grant kirkhope is so nice https://twitter.com/grantkirkhope/status/829499184856182784 look at that picture someone sent him
it's pretty cheap early on and gives you a big xp boost
level up your castle
oh also
yeah either use her, or level your other dudes up to 20 so you can get them more stars
but once you get someone to level 20 you can spend feathers to upgrade their star rating anyway so if you are already close to 20 you might want to just do that instead
it's definitely worth it to use someone with 4 or 5 stsars even if they are  a lower level
its like a more extreme version of IVs
even if they are a lower level, they have naturally higher stats
also do you have any people with stars
good because i forget
just go to Allies > level up or Allies > Learn Skills
and spend skill points if you have them built up on some characters
crystals are a currency exclusively used for leveling up your people so you might as well use those too
you can also use crystals to level them up
you can grind your dudes at the training tower
lol
oh im not even there yet
which one
in a main story level?
how are you stuck
therefore it must be the real serious ronald
the real ronald wouldn't respond
thats how you know it's not an imposter ronald
go check out some serious comics and study them along with your serious games
yeah serious ronald
i know it's better than ours because i was aware of this one but not aware of ours
i bet it's only closing because their owner got a job with bernie sanders
yeah
this depresses me and i dont even buy comics
puyo puyo tetris looks cool
classic <:ronald:230126993008623616>
of?
lol
crypt of the necrodancer
so like temple run

<@!155893986605793281> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNwdDkfRiUU
i think it's a funny name regardless of the meaning
really
yae
whats the negative conotations in english?
lol
i just noticed they did it
because it was really blurry and shitty resolution
lol they filterized that photo
the difference here is that i specifically asked you to look at this though
you generously showed to us all
oh was it that publisher file
what flyer
like at least the people that lost the race for president still get to be senators
im also definitely more qualified than the other person running i just dont trust myself to get that fact across in a 2 minute speech
I could technically run for both positions but I dont want to split people's votes on me since I can ultimately only do one
but if i lose the race for managing editor, then i just become nothing 😦
im trying to become managing editor instead of IT board chair
google it i did their website
iujur
goddamnit im not running unopposed for an exec position so now i actually have to prepare
itsnot on android
Aside from your own work, are there any books concerning philosophy of mind that you can recommend?
John Searle: I don’t think any of them are any good really.
then it's basically the brain
where you just have a bunch of men working together manipulating symbols inside a big gym
there's another thought experiment called the chinese gym
yeah you could just say that the individual neurons in the brain don't understand the chemicals they are manipulating, yet the whole brain does have understading
admist all the high level AI and neuroscience we have now
also he still is adamant about his chinese room 37 years later
where he basically said he stopped reading books by other philosophers because he doesnt agree with any of them
i once read an interview with him
yeah thats why it can be confusing because any avid reader will notice a lot of problems that he doesnt really address
even if you dont accept that particular counterpoint, there are a bunch of others i could use too
but ultimately that set of rules is what defines your understanding of the symbol
i mean the ruleset can be huge and the definition can just get more and more complex
then that unknown symbol for "cat" is now partially defined by the rule that it should be placed in the same category as this other symbol for "dog"
i.e.
everytime you see the chinese word for "cat" you pair it with some unknown symbol for "dog"
and apply some set of rules to it every time you see it
like if you see some unkown symbol
like a chinese speaker would understand that he may be manipulating the word for "cat" but the understanding of that word for "cat" only comes from how it was used in relation to everything else in the first place
and you cant really argue that the human brain is doing anything more than that either
i would argue that the meaning of those syymbols is defined by the ruleset the man is using to manipulate them
yeah thats just one way his argument sucks
because all they do is manipulate symbols
hes trying to say that digital machines cant understand
anyway then why do i need to explain it
like 15
i thought it was a lot longer
and if you read his paper on the chinese room you'll see why
he is
thats the chinese room
searle is an asshole
because i coudlnt resist
AND I LOOKED AT IT
gameinformer already revealed what one of th emajor bosses was
no one will just casually mention spoilers online for a new game
plus they spoiler tagged stuff
well for pokemon i just never went to /r/pokemon and was fine
now real spoilers will be everywhere
giving the press access to the game so soon is bad
no
do they not understand the concept of "spoilers"
4 weeks before release
and practically review the whole thing
does nintendo let game informer play botw
why the hell
the tutorial of mario and luigi dream team is like 10
thats nothing
but none for the most anticipated game of 2017
and will cost millions
because the special edition is limited
except you wont
for that one game
the rest of the money is amiibos
i only bought 1 game for the switch and it was 100 dollars
its ok i have almost 500 dollars of switch stuff bought
graphics wise
it looks kind of liek that
you should get dq builders
the 3ds version looks cool too
yeah boy
huh]
this is really hype: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE2Dc1sx71U
liek a textbook or some shit
this dude fucking made a pdf and used all the correct symbols and fonts when displaying code within it
some people put way too much effort into their assignments
shame
i dont know people even write answers to programming assignments in word
some people submitted .java files with comments as answers
no they could have done any thing
because they didnt turn in the majority of hte problems
they still got a 34%
i almost gave them a zero until i realized the extension was probably wrong
it's like they had a .docx and then purposely made it a .txt to fuck with me
i have no idea why someone would turn in their assignment like that
wut
.
dont waste your money on that shit
there are better soundtracks
nvm apparently thats what happens when you manually change a .docx extension to .txt
<@!127535721857679362> do you have any idea what this txt file is encoded as
especialyl the one with the fire
her artwork is super cool
oh i have her
https://imgur.com/OqQMOLc
first ever loss
god damnit i just lost to a guy named swamp ass
thats part of what revived the series though
also it wastes stamina
you just dont get to keep the xp and you have to try again
nothing
it's going to get a lot harder though later on because two of my people dont have any stars so they have shitty stats
but you lose those when any one hero dies
ive lost on one of the special maps
shes just so nice to me
i think she's original for this game
my favorite is sharena
he's a big boy roy now
oh nvm my boy roy is 17 now
what about you
between 14 and 15
im going to need to get a better team when i beat the main story and start doing hard and lunatic modes
but ive also done a lot of arcade battles
im on chapter 5of the main story
my team really sucks but im making since i have one 5 star dude
yeah
lol
lol this trailer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkPvATin4AQ
make it like harry potter but the lightning bolt is actually the nose instead
i just want the nose
no the only similarity os baldness and stoic expression
diglett face
?
because we need to advertise a conference to your class
im not
yeah thats all i need
?
not mondays/
why tuesdays and wednesdays
where in woodburn
what time and place is your q101
or if youre a computer scientist and want to tap into their APIs
you just dont hear about them because they are very enterprise focused
but thye making big bucks
nothing really for everyday consumers i think besides watson apps
and other  enterprise-level stuff
and servers
watson
yeah dude
its all about deepmind
no one cares about watson anymore
mhm
like how do random relatives/parents decide to get these games for me
idk how i got these games
but i played it a lot
because it was shitty
mostly of frustration
i have so many memories of that game
this was my game
omg
yea
it was with somes kids that had different powers or something
no
it was third party and i cant remember the name
that i played a ton of
there was another skateboarding platformer type adventure game too
which i doont think i played that much but have many memories of
there was also dogz
frogger adventures
probably like a billion
i dont even know how many times i beat frogger
there were some gameboy advance games that that i played so much
but those were one time things
so i see what you mean
but there are still a lot of games i remember really enjoying as a kid that just suck now
yeah
and see the genius
when i can look at the technical aspects and design decisions
i agree with all that but i think for me it is easier to appreciate things now
yeah we know you have to get it on xbox
what people will remember
i mean in history
i dont mean me personally
on what the classics will be 15 years from now
but i want to make a 15 year bet still
also sure
like what
i think you can only do that as a kid
do you want to make a 15 year bet
its the same except you understand the games better
its not one and done
i should buy a used wii u
no in 15 years from now people will look back at the wii u and be like damn it had a good catalog of games
but i dont think you would fully understand the greatness
being 8 is different than being 20
so i could experience its awesome catalog of games first hand
damn i wish i was the age i am now when the n64 came out
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoldenEye:_Source
apparently some people made a mod for the multiplayer aspect on the source engine
maybe not as much as ocarina holds up
it has to at laest a little bit
there's probably genius soemwhere
something about them had to make them so good
apparently there's a remastered version on xbox live arcade
why
everyone always talks about them
and golden eye
perfect dark seems like a good game
because thats something i can do inbetween/during classes
ive been spending more time reading about video games online than actually playing them
sad
besides like 3 games of dota
i didnt even get to play video games this weekend
not on the weekends
oone day i'll have time to play video games
me too
i woke up this morning and went to classes
i need to play chronotrigger
that i guess you are already doing so good job
its just something to do
not at the same time
we
yes
we need to play metroid prime
oh he's also played melee
considering you can probably make any other game inside of it
i always forget that minecraft is a genuinely good game
lol
*aka not the best source
*aka dunkey
*mixed things from one guy
but when you said infinite i had to check because ive heard mixed things about it
yeah
i didnt think it was that highly rated
bioshock infinite isnt on the list
still he needs to expand his genre
oh yeah you're right
i told him he should play batman
no
ah i though he only had 2
hotline 1?
i think thats only because he hasnt played anything other than fps rpgs
he can play it on that
yeah
i dont even think hes played portal 1 though
no
i mean on that list, I only see falout 3, skyrim, tetris, and portal 1 and 2 that he's played
i only brought it up because ronald cant figure out what games to play and i told him he has barely played any of the classics
a lot more than that
<@!127535721857679362> I think you've only played 4 or 5 games on this list
this is pretty cool: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_considered_the_best
yeah i saw apparently whole regions of the city where they are bootcamping dont have internet
weird
the ds4 dousnt have it
probably not enough games used it so it wasnt worth including
i see
do you mean analogue triggers
<@!155893986605793281> I found it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSEQCVtk2dA
DAC qualifiers
finally some big tournaments are starting again
https://www.twitch.tv/beyondthesummit2
ew
!= seems like you're negating a variable assignment or something
which makes more sense to me since == is the comparison and !
is negating it
also I guess only javascript and python lets you do !==
yeah
For some reason I had to do != Instead of ! .equals
fuck this language
WHY IS NOT EQUALS !=
FUCKING JAVA
i beat it yesterday, it's a pretty good game
oh ok
keenan how far did you get in abzu'
yea
lol thats like xenoblade chronicles X.
everyone complains about that soundtrack because it has really shitty lyrical parts but the rest is amazing
i havent gotten all the way through 4 yet
in terms of ost 3 is the best
mhmm although apparently the ending is bad because kojima didnt want konami to keep making him make mgs
before you played mgs
remember when yous aid mgsv was a bad game
so he didnt return it?
gg
good game
yo <@!127535721857679362> <@!125452744440938497> dark moon?
yeah give me a sec to wrap up this assignment
it reminds me of ori and the blind forest except handdrawn
looks beautiful
im excited to try hollow knight
ive subscribed durring random months in the past but none of them have been this good before
havent heard of the last two though
its got abzu, a hollow knight sneak peek, steamworld heist, ryse: son of rome, xcom 2, project highrise and okhlos
damn i picked the right month to subscribe to the humble monthly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CxpQEl3nKQ
thats pretty cool
lol https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5rupll/looking_for_a_cute_boy_to_live_a_bromance_with_me/
oh right i think ive seen that movie
whats the lizard thing from then
not a lizard thing
i googled Freddy Lounds and she is a human
i dont understnad that picture
ronald why are you playing fallout 4 at 5 am
https://i.giphy.com/NnMVyfuRn39BK.gif
i need to make a gif of that
later in the ad that girl sits on the bed next to him and rubs his back but he's still playing away
"Then you have this guy here, who’s so enamored with the Nintendo Switch that he can’t even be bothered to look away from his screen while an attractive woman is dancing right in front of him.
According to the commercial he’s playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, so he’s not even overlooking sex in favor of a new game.
That shit’s three years old.
The implication is clear — he’s had so much sex following his purchasing of the Switch that he no longer feels compelled to even avert his eyes from a 3-year-old game to take a passing glance at a pair of pirouetting buttocks.
Make no mistake, this guy fucks."
http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1206831-nintendo-switch-will-make-attractive-women-popular
he even came with a cool animated intro scene
woah i just summoned a 5 star Roy
sharena is my favorite
they should all be like this
i think i like the graphics in this game better than the normal fire emblem games
just makes them into a single stronger version which makes sense
its only for duplicates though
oh hey you can merge heroes
its way better on the usage than pokemon go at least
hes a spy
i have this guy named matthew and he has a cool art style
and the left most slot is the team leader
you can have different set combinations of 4 heroes
oh i see
im kind of confused on how team building works in the ally section
they are probably from other games
yeah i dont have any people i recognize
we must start with a different random selection
yeah i dont
i dont ave her
there are helpful tooltips on the character detail screens
yeah i have to learn what everyhting does
yea but you probably have to play thorugh some of the campaign first
its like pokemon amee but with humans
and they say something of you
dude you can tap on the people to get hearts
you deserved it
well kiran
lol
?
you have to get the story ronald
lol
she rides on a little dragon
im just going to stare at this purple lady when this downloads
A+
soundtrack is on point
i dont even own any of the ds ones
this is a new entry in the series thats just on mobile
this isnt a ds game
yeah
shit the graphics in this game are amazing
like all mobile games ronald
yeah you can spend money to unlock stuff faster
like 3 min
the matches are short
its more like civ or something
except not real time
its probably like those mobile games you used to play
yeah
as a good introduction to all the fire emblem boys
thats honestly why i want to play it
it has really good artwork
im just listening to the theme song on the home menu
not anymore they just released a mobile app
its a strategy rpg
fire emblem
maybe later i need to try this fe game first
asher play fire emblem with me
ronald play fire emblem with me
keenan play fire emblem with me
ew
oh horror
i dont know what that is either
what is rings
"In cases where a mere click doesn’t produce a conclusive response, a pop-up window will require users to decipher the same old distorted text. "

those newer captchas are a google thing keenan

in terms of everything else
but they are some of the best
dude the twilight princess boss fights are the easiest boss fights in any zelda ive played
i dont care if it's easy
whats that have to do with kirby
but the games cost 30-40
when their campaigns are usually less than 10 hours
keenan how do i convince myself to buy and play kirby games
but they almost always do something for chinese new year
dota doesnt usually do events for holidays other than the battle pass themes
lunar new year
junkenstein
cool
<@!127535721857679362> <@!125452744440938497> dark moon?
and i could escape once i pass some trial you create on the outside
i'd be trapped
that would be pretty cool
but not get bored
so so i can participate
so i just play survival normally
and im the only one not in creative
no see i was thinking we should start a minecraft server thats creative
sounds like europa universalis
however stardew valley is superior because it has marriage
i see, i see
missing out
still
idk why you guys dont play stardew valley
especialyl the automation industrial ones
just ask asher he knows all about those minecraft mods probably
no ds doesnt have that i just checked
ronald im sure that exists
i think you can use keyboard mouse but no one does because it's terrible for rocket league
becauase it's literally the only game to do it
yeah i always forget rl has that
and xbox and pc
but between ps4 and pc
just not between ps4 and xbox
actually nvm it has crossplatform play
lol
you should but on pc so i can play it with you
sort of but garry's mod had much smaller server sizes
and maybe taking on a new persona
just go in with the mindset you are starting fresh each time
and not worrying about preserving your stuff
i think rust would be more fun to just log on and mess around every once in a while
there was also some resemblence of a government with laws
civcraft was cool once you established yourself
nah then it just turns into an mmorpg
but i mean if you ahd a group of friends it wouldnt be so bad because you could hunt as a pack
and so you have to fear everyone
its basicaly survival minecraft multiplayer but if the server had absolutely no rules
lol
which is why i havent bought it even when it goes on sale
i also dont think i would get a lot of hours out of rust unless all my friends had it
yeah ofc
plus i have no way of buying it used
i just dont think i can get that many hours out of it
maybe
rust is multiplayer
i disagree
ya and charged triple a pricing
but if you buy it used its not supporting the devs
i also dont really want to support the devs because they seem kind of shitty
so even at 15 it's still too much
yeah just for me though i think i could only get about 5 hours out of that game
well of course if they were free id get them too
because there's a good chance they will and now since the technology is there to make those games portable, i want everything portable
im kind of waiting on buying a lot of those indie games though to see if they come on switch
heard good things about both
that and the witness
yeah i wanted to get that game next time it goes on sale
i saw
for everything
or actually you hold the wiimote and i control the nunchuck
we actually just trade off at every boss
so uh midway through the campaign
i know in reality we each own half of each game
i know dude
actually i'll wait to determine which is the bes until i play
but the best
no i want to own metroid prime 1 and half of 2 instead
I'll pay you next time i see you or on Venmo if you have that
Let's do it
Nice
Like the collection or individually?
For Wii?
no he evolved from a cute little citizen of an animal town into a psychopathic killer who now runs the whole town
well last year was the biggest year for pokemon ever so maybe that ad helped
and the anniversary
just pokemon
that one was awesome since it wasnt marketed about a specific game
the 20th anniversary one
do you remember the pokemon ad they did last year
there are kids in it for like 2 seconds
anyway did you see the superbowl ad
i am triggered
i think your logic is wrong here
going by price, wii u must be 0/10 of a psn
psn is 10/10
so then
sounds a little bit subjective to me
you cant really quanitify these things
uh huh
the pairing with the website is really well madde
also mario maker has one the best online platforms
no
mario maker
one game
like with what
bro
bro you dont even use a wii u
we good
so unless they do worse than that
well i think the wii u's online is already a third
and a third of the quality
according to Kimishima it will be 2000-3000 yen
seems like nintendos online service will be about 20 bucks a year
Unfortunately it's not the shaving or the toilet one
They serious
Nintendo is running super bowl ads again
And spent years studying the mechanics of its udder
They ordered the best cow in all of Asia
That's the reason the game costs so much
I wonder how many akward Japanese programmers they had to.bring to a farm in order to make this game
Milk vs real farm boy
Also there's this http://www.gamesradar.com/1-2-switch-nintendo-switch-game-preview/
Look me in the eye simulator 2017
Because that's literally all Nintendo talks about when talking about this game
Emphasis on look me in the eye
It's really popular in Japan.
Like the fourth best selling game atm out of all games
It's a genius game but I still can't decide it it's worth $40
Your fetish just wasn't invented yet
Damn those women are shaving thheir non existent beards with a joycon
Lol
What time
what an epic boss theme
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj-YZ1J37oM
<@!125452744440938497> alright asher i know i said i would play but im actually pretty tired and i need to wake up early tomorrow so i cant tonight.
probably tomorrow though
https://twitter.com/SmashAtIUB
there's a tier 1 caster though thats one of the most famous casters
there arent any like "tier 1" playesr but there are several tier 2 players that are still very well known
i just want to watch
i dont want to play
no
there will be famous players and casters there
we should go to the big IUB smash tournament on mar 25th
btw
clash of clans
its very serious stuff
when i practice smash and play tp
only on saturdays when i go home
i already dont use my wii u during the week
we'll see
that sits at home
is a netflix machine
if theres one thing the switch isnt going to be
and zelda machine
no dude it's netflix
actually maybe i could just bring the ps3 to my apartment
esp after botw comes out
because i dont have time otherwise
or during summer
no wait you're gone
yeah i think the trade would have to be during sprint break or something
lol
but thats playing like 3 hours every week
it's taken me like 2 months to beat twilight princess which is 40 hours
yeah thats like the same as w101
wonderufl 101
you know what other platinum game has amazing ratings
you ignored me
i told you about that like a week ago
you should play those other games
bayonetta 2 is probably shorter though
but color splash, and wonderful 101 are not that short of games
true
one week isnt long enough for me to beat a game unless its during summer
is wonderful 101
you know what you should play
but maybe it was executed poorly
ive never really looked at reviews i just like the gameplay concept
idk why
the 2016 has really low ratings
k
i dont trust you
did you eveer listen to that paper mario stuff
i can play a game of that in  a bit
oh i see i just havent used it enough
it has just a checkbox for me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsF7enQY8uI
woah thats useful
no i cant i have to do hw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx5t0baXhc
it's like some skit straight out of Silicon Valley
I can't believe this is real
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64TbMz-hA3w
or use them right
these fuckers either need to not use numbers
??!?!?!
how did microsoft windows go from windows 7 to 8 to 10?
how did xbox 360 come out in 2005 but the xbox one come out in 2013?
?!?!?!?
I DONT KNOW KEENAN DEVELOPERS REALLY NEED TO LEARN HOW TO COUNT
doom 2 and 3 still came out before doom that's fair
everything on n64 had to be called 64
i dont think you understand
da fuck is this
but himan came out in 2016
ok how did hitman 2 come out in 2002
even closer to a typical fire emblem than mario run is to normal mario
plus it looks a lot more like fire emblem than pokemon go looks like pokemon for example
i have to play that before i play the real games befoore the real games ruin it for me
on thursday we need to get into fire emblem heroes
what a great family

also remember that this is tingle's dad
i think the guy responsible for him is koizumi since he was the character designer for majora's mask
solid thought process there
lol
he's already pretty scary
because he's definitely the definition of a fairy
i cant wait to see tingle concept art

yeah since all their original fantasy monsters and races have now just become staples of the franchise
nvm i hacked the code
i want to see this http://www.polygon.com/2017/1/31/14454158/zelda-art-artifacts-book
how do i fix the pictures on polygon
noooooo
I just love how thats a headline
wtf http://gonintendo.com/stories/273023-after-17-years-a-new-hidden-coin-is-discovered-in-donkey-kong-64
moral of the show
it was just all just a prank
like they take off in a plane but guess what the plane wasnt actually real and it was just a prop
im reading the plot of the sequel now and i forgot how crazy/random it is
yeah i think it was a good concept
they aren't very memorable movies i guess
and i completely forgot what the sequel was and that i had even watched it until i looked up the plot summary just now
i think i watched both it and the sequel at the beginning of the semester last year
well thats really what magic is
and that it was strange
i just remember it had good music and some cool magic tricks
it was kind of strange
yea
can you get skins or something
sony is really lacking on the color front
although the newer xbox one controllers have way better color options than ds4
and im more hyped for the switch pro controller than the actuall system
half the reason i want a ps4 is just because the controllers are cool
i like the hardware
but i kind of want one of each
yeah
apparently they work pretty well on windows pcs now
i think i need to buy a ds4 controller
It seemed really hard
Oh you weren't there the night he discovered it
cool
on ninja kiwi ?
is it still an online game
thats another one of those nostalgia games for me
lol
who instead of writing a book, made a game
the developers
i feel like unless the game is designed specifically to be played that way, then you're missing out
😦
then it becomes uncharted 4
ifi you only care about the story and do that then it's no different from a book or a movie
like if i grind too much in rpgs it just becomes an Attack-mashing progression through the story and nothing else
but for me it's just enough so to add some variety
its not even like survival is that difficult especially when we disable losing items on death
i think the best way to keep my attention is having a variety of things to do
i can imagine the same being true for hhd although ive never palyed it
ultimately the 1-dimensional play style of creative minecraft is what makes it boring after a while
even with godlike progression there's still a greater challenge in survival and that makes it feel less monotonous by breaking up the segments where you're just building blocks and makes it feel more like  a game
it's probably the same reason why i get bored of minecraft creative mode since i dont have to work for any of the stuff and there's no progression
like the mechanics in that game should just be directly implemented into a larger AC game
i feel like the whole home designing experience is useless by itself, id rather have the rest of the world to design too
do you hvae it
but i dont like the home designing experience just by itself
thats actually not a bad game
thats animal crossing and not splatoon 2
i hope animal crossing mobile being delayed means the animal crossing team is working on a real game
yeah those were probably my first pc game
that was even before 4th grade
i need to get one of those again sometime
i also played like all the magic school bus games
oh shit
rip club penguin
anyways
i fucking love elmo
dont remember them though
i played some weird typing games
and then for pc it was probably age of mythology and then lego star wars which came out in 2005
i know that for sure
my literal first game ever was pokemon emerald
2005
but nope
for some reason i was thinking that i was 9 years old in 2008 or some shit
then it would make sense
yeah i just need to match up my age, with the year, and with my current grade
so it must have ibeen in 2009 since galaxy 2 came out in 2010
i remember that mario galaxy 2 came out the year after i got the wii
and then the wii in 2009
and then i got the ds a couple years later in like 2007
ok so maybe i got the gameboy sp in 2005
wtf
i was 10 in 2006
shit fuck
the same year i got the ds lite
or 2009
i got the wii in like 2010
i never got consoles right when they came out until the 3ds
and i got pokemon diamond
probably around 2009
i remember saving up for a whole summer to get a nintendo ds
i probably beat the age of mythology campaign 3 or 4 times
like 100% completion since those were the only games i had
hardcore on pc
and i also started playing poptropica and age of mythology and lego star wars and lego indiana jones
so yeah i got a gameboy when i was 9 along with pokemon emerald and sapphire, and a bunch of other 3rd party games that really sucked looking at them now but were the best thing ever back then
i think 9 years old is the age of fourth grade or so
i also got a gameboy sp when i was 9
i dont really think i started gaming at all until 4th grade when my we got a family desktop i could use
i was mainly a pc gamer from an aearly age
i never told you my console story but it's a lot less robust than yours
lol
that's my onling gaming saga
mixed in
and it's still dota with some overwatch
and then dota
and that lasted until sophomore year in highschool
and then i got into minecraft around 2009 or 2010
runescape was early middle school
poptropica and club penguin were sometime in 4-6th grade
i cant remember the order in which i play/grew out of them but runescape was the final stage
i have an insane amount of nostalgia for those games
club penguin, poptropica, and runescape were my big three childhood online gaming experiences
rip club penguin

and are smart enough to recognize spam
discords demographic is also way better with technology than most people who use skype
first one on discord though
i get them all the time on skype
thats when you know your chat app is legit
discord has officially reached skype levels of spam friend requests
Alright guys I guess there's no reason to buy the switch now http://store.steampowered.com/app/583570/?snr=1_7_7_230_150_1

<@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362>
anyone want to play a game of dark moon
hi
hmm
i dont know if the 4 dollars cheaper sams club prices are worth traveling across town when shipping is free on amazon
the 5 pound twizzlers are only $17
but i dnt have a costco
you can get like 4 or 5 pounds for less than 15 dollars
i really want to get some twizzlers or jelly beans
speaking of amazon, ronald have you ever ordered large  quantities of candy from amazon?
I love his use of quotation marks here

hey people we should play dotas
yeah you did i wore them at hacknc
i got glasses for that too but still dont use them for class lectures, i just sit in the front instead.
i only use them for shows or to play video games on my tv
i would just see someone
if it doesnt go away after a couple days then yeah its worth it
i dont think we're qualified to diagnose that
i mean it's a headache in the sense that things up close are more blurry so it takes more effort to focus on them
it happens when i go to bigger cities with more pollution usually
sometimes when my allergies act up, my vision changes and becomes worse temporarily
It's raining dipping dots guys
So I save like every 20 min
Popping out a cart is my worst nightmare
No one talks about how not only is the switch's card slot on the back, it also has a cover so that accidental pop out won't happen
yeto and yeta are the best
But maybe Nintendo has done this before with some of their smaller IPS
Yeah it's kind of unprecedented as far as i know
Wasn't Rare the last non Japanese studio to develop for nintendo
Which doesn't happen often
Is this is a Nintendo IP not made by a Japanese studio
The other thing though
It's good for them
Thia is the biggest thing their studio has done
They wouldn't have enough agreed to work with Nintendo if they thought they would make more money by doing it themselves
It's still going to make them legit
https://twitter.com/SFBTom/status/822185010195271680
Not exactly
It's called snippet clips.
Coming this march.
Play it then
Why would i want a PC version
I can later tonight
Im aware
<@!127535721857679362> join the call
yo <@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362>
alright i have to eat something but then i'll be ready
I'm on my way home and then I can play
these adjectives though "including the chance to receive an implausibly indescribably-rare Immortal Dark Moon Baby Roshan courier of peerless origin."
oh yeah it we have to do a bunch of security
why is it terrible
but german has them make websites
it's h212 which is the java class
yeah
<@!127535721857679362> this kid knows his  shit http://silo.cs.indiana.edu:52869/
and then i felt bad when people actually couldnt zip stuff
i did for this class
im just saying you can never overestimate someones ability
lol
because people didnt know how
i just had to teach an honors computer science class how to make zip archives so they could submit their homework properly
no keenan
keenan you know how i always specify trivial things like how to make a zip file
maybe he'll teach you a new language
you should just ask him
my expert analysis senses tell me that it's his own made up language
...
they might not even be notes, i mean you're the one writing an mgs ananlysis
it's true for all three but yeah
chrono cross or one of the ones i mentioned
the two best soundtracks ive heard were I am Setsuna and the Shantae series
oh recently though
i might have
this soundtrack is like a mix of the original stuff plus galaxy
lol
man this is so good https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P602M5pe7tU
sure after i finish twilight princess
this must be one bonkers game
wtf there are mario kart tracks in this ost
paper mario color splash has so many awesome remixes of classic stuff
https://youtu.be/65TaCvZN8Lo
https://youtu.be/u-vFhTdTbsg
idk how you can tell res from a gif
the real one is just mario kart 😦
ok so that gif is edited
yeah he's really moving that joy stick
everything about this ad seems like a joke
lol look at the screen http://i.imgur.com/VqzlXPx.gif
no one would even know
yup just put it flat on desk, and a joycoon in each hand, and then hands in pockets
two ideal uses right there
and also eight people playing local multiplayer during a college lecture
lol the new german nintendo switch commercial shows someone using it while pooping
since bw2 was a sequal they probably decided to keep the same engine as stuff as the original bw
and then bw2 came out in the 3ds's first year
the original black and white came out a year before the 3ds
not a 3ds game
but it was a ds game
theyve always used pixel art until gen 6
i dont know what you are talking about
but the overworld in gen 5 is my favorite
maybe the pokemon sprites
i really like gen 5
eh
gen 3 was really good at the time but nowadays i dont think it stacks up against some of the other gens
emerald or something?
what pokemon game was released in 2004
except what they are
well we dont know what any of those games are
i know how badly we are all waiting for last of us 2 in 2018
best year
2
probably last of us
probably that kojima game
new fire emblem
new marvel rpg
best year
2018
but dude
clearly
without further research
its hard to actually define the best
ok maybe i meant the best recently
it's still good
but even if you ignore their shit
aside from pokemon
nintendo hasnt been doing their nintendo shit for a while now
and they will forget about 2004
in 13 years everyone will be like wow 2017 had so many classic comes out
you're just old school
a new kingdom hearts maybe
and they are all lining up this year
but still all these big series usually take a while for new games
new ff came last year
a new dragon quest
a new zelda
a new mario
a new mass effect
but we have a new red dead
but the only thing missing this year is some new elder scrolls or fallout game
rip
stuff that usually has long 3-5 year cycles
a lot of big series are getting new games
im just saying in general
even if we dont
2017 is going to be the best year for games
i just heard people were excited for it
i dont really know anything about it
isnt that new spiderman game supposed to be good.
im not sure if it's an rpg though
it does sound pretty hype
you never know
literally no info
so in other words
you never know
maybe today is the day they decided to do something new
just ebcause square only makes rpgs
its an rpg
you cant just assume
whats the point of hyping up some announcement if they dont tell us anything
literally no info
i nkow
humble bundle is also announcing something today so for all we know it could just be a square/marvel themed humble bundle
i personally hope they are not related so i can get more info about dragon quest or octopath
i wonder if square and marvel are actually doing something or if they just happen to be making announcements on the same day
https://twitter.com/Babylonian/status/824481721936596992
why is the hud blue
how the fuck did i get 13 hours in a demo with only 1 stage and 5 playable characters
and 47 hours in the full 3ds game
dude i checked the other day and somehow i have 13 hours in the smash for 3ds demo
all before release
and smash
so did pokemon moon
via a demo
you can play yoshi and poochy right now
demo downloads are better
BUT NO
i just was looking forward to listening to the soundtrack before even starting the game
i think i have some cd playing device at home
why dont they give you a flash drive
who even has cd players
this ruins everything
ugh
i just realized im going to need a cd player to play my botw ost cd when it comes out
fuck
yeah i heard mgs5 is good game
zle
puz
yeah it's an obstacle for unlocking the optional quest
ok buddy but im not letting you get away with this not a puzzle nonsense
it can be both an optional quest and a puzzle
therefore a puzzle
youi have to figure it out
but it doesnt seem like that quest is strictly given to you
yeah so an optional puzzle
puzzling
its like those room escape games
its an option puzzle
i think of it as a puzzle
ww has very different types of puzzles
just interesting to see the comparison
not liek either way is worse than another
and wont be the same type of creativity you see in something more sandbox like botw
but also that type of creativity is scripted
i mean that type of stuff is what separates a good game from a great game
mgs ;ets you jack them off
let me guess
sure
got to write it first
i think it would be fun to formalize all that in a review
i also have a list of anticipated problems with botw that will prevent it from being goty
i have a google doc of all my problems with pokemon moon
also i just like coming up with negative things for games that i really like
other people who might want to try it for the first time would be interested
also framing it from the perspective that you are examing mgs for the first time 10-20 years later is interesting
it'd be an interesting practice
i already established that im going to do that just for fun for zelda
you need to write a full length review for the mgs series
not exactly the same as mgs but similar as in repeated tries wont become not engaging
it just seems liek procedurally generated levels is something you would like
why dont you play more rouge-likes
yea
i mean it saves your keys and switchs and stuff
in a way
and also snipperclips
and btw that kind of creativity with puzzle is exactly what botw is advertising
because it seemed to me like something every game has
and why it might be cool in mgs
well then i guess i am only now understanding what you are referring to
and they dont give any hints on where to find it
is filled with stuff to find in every game
the whole map and environment
rather than setting it up as having multiple options for a puzzle, and rewarding you for finding other options, it allows you to use stuff in creative ways to find secrets elsewhere
zelda isn'y about combat you cant really use boss fights as an example.
depends what you define as extra
also on a scale of 1 - 10 im at about a 2 in terms of investment in this argument
because you are required to understand every mechanic to progress but you can always do extra for more reward
well then you can say the same for zelda
every game rewards mastery of certain mechanics
now you're saying it rewards ability rather than being a requirement to beat the game
like what if it's the norm to deviate from the perceived norm
is it really the norm then
ok when i ever play the game i will see about htat
it never was
aiming is not a core mechanic of zelda games
with the sword
windwaker twilight princess and skyward sword all have enemies that you need to defeat in certain ways
but you do need to have fluency
you dont necessarily need all the upgrades
you still need some level of mastery with every item or ability in zelda before you can beat the game
twilight princess has a lot of horse chase segments
that you need to pass
in severqal games there are horse parts
zelda is known for it's minigames
because it's just a minigame
but you still have to learn all the functions
well then dont use ambigous pronouns boy
oh
isnt that zelda
hows it different from zelda then
what else do you do in metal gear besides shooting and stealth
but it also isnt an rpg
their mechanics are so complex they cant possibly make you learn eerything
yeah but thats true of any rpg
beating the e4 with a full competitive team sounds pretty challenging
earthbound is actually a challenging game if you let it be
cant win a ti though
dota
what are features
it still probably dimishes the attention you can put towards work
because it still takes a little bit of focus to grind
it seems counter intruitive to me especially if you're imptient
you can and you shouldnt need to grind to do so
if it's too easy then there's no strategy involved which is what i care about
lol
grinding early on is pretty bad compared to later
the curve is a lot different from pokemon
sure but when you progress the next area is like 200-300 or more
except early on the areas give like no xp
why
pocket
i think either a third or half of it
you lose money
or go to hotels and stay the night
or food
you use psi
"Not capable of actual shapeshifting disguises!"
"Large enough to be seated at the dinner table!"
https://www.pokemoncenter.com/ditto-large-cushion---25-701-02417
but apparently that was enough to cause me to completely not udnerstand what is happening in my lecture right now
keenan you distracted me for like 30 seconds
i tend to ignore all pokemon spin off games even official pokemon company ones
it's all i know
im going off the titles here buddy
if i were a monster hunter fan i would suggest monster rancher 4
its name sounds the most like legend of zelda
probably the legend one
why are you asking me
ok screw the dipping dots ones, this is my new favorite headline http://www.cbsnews.com/news/badlands-national-park-twitter-goes-rogue-starts-tweeting-facts-about-the-environment/
thats kind of mean
i dont understand how they are already advertising tekken 7 dlc when the game isnt out until june
arms has the most donors but it's still losing
or has the most people all willing to donate a little bit
it's all about which community is the richest
https://www.generosity.com/explore?filter_title=EVO#/search
because they put arms up which isn't out yet either
it's weird
no just mvc3
ah here we go https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/3kauk1/fighting_games_on_steam_total_sales_current/
i wonder what the size comparison of fighting game communities is like
it's going to be real hard for arms to win considering it isn't released yet and these other games have actual competitive scenes
aw man pokken and killer instinct are beating it now
and it's leading the vote already
you can vote it in
So ARMS might be at Evo 2017
and like no wii u games did other than pikmin 3
you didnt even need to use it if games didnt use pointer controls
it's also the first nintendo console in 11 years since obviously the wii u was just a wii peripheral
im definitely going for half a game option
sometime a girl so difficult get a boyfriend or sometimes a women can get new sensation with her relationship for the other couple.

it doesnt look as cool when the horse isn't moving

no one actually wants a 40 dollar real pokemon game on the app store
"I think we all just really, really want The Pokémon Company to give us a regular Pokémon game with the exploring, collecting, and battling that made the franchise so beloved." yeah you fuck they do every year
this article...
http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/01/24/pokemon-duel-comes-android-still-isnt-pokemon-game-want/
crypt of the necrodancer is only 3.74 on steam right now if anyone wants to get a really cool and unique game
it probably sucks
well it was out in japan last year but now it's here
the pokemon company just released another app secretly
but do they battle you in smash
https://youtu.be/1EP4KUgy_Nc
apparently he also tweeted about going to an anime convention
this is my favorite article this week http://www.avclub.com/article/trumps-new-press-secretary-five-year-running-feud--248859
alright
i need to go to bed soon
asher in how long?
do you want to play dota
why would he
i dont think he actually has league installed on his office computer
didnt you make a dota hero thing
also apparently he has kid(s) and they go to jackson creek
he has a shortcut for league of legends on his desktop
German is very mysterious
i dont think so
no i had a meeting with him in his office and the first thing he did was pull up the HT and the science olympiad article about us
<@!127535721857679362> ronald german still remembers you.
today he talked about your bleached hair and how you wouldn't take off your hat
there are some actual good players going to this

shit at one of the biggest smash majors they just ran an ad for IU bloomington smash tourney
<@!155893986605793281> you should watch this smash4 tournament right now.
bayonetta is being played and she looks like such a cool character
wtf you can pull the ancients with rubick lift
<@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362> dota?
I really hope Lanky Kong is an Arms character
I thought you said it was garbage
I do think the switch is Nintendo's most traditional console since the GameCube though
True but 1-2switch clearly had a higher development cost than something like Wii sports.
It's more similar to nintendo land, and the Nintendo land bundle for Wii U was 50 dollars extra.
I don't think they could have made a profit off of 1-2 switch if it was free.
But I do think they can get away with a free sample of the game that has enough minigames to showcase the system but not enough to where they would lose money on it
But i could see them discounting  12switch a lot or include a free demo with like a third of the minigames or something
Yeah but you could argue that a) Nintendo doesn't want 12 switch representing the switch like Wii sports represented the Wii.
They probably want to keep it marketed as a more "typical/hardcore" console which is why all their marketing has been with Zelda.
And b) if it were bundled the cost of the system would be higher and not a lot of people want to pay extra for a system if they don't want that game
12 switch is really weird because it's too simple for the hardcore audience and too expensive for the casual audience who doesn't know anything about games.
So it's unclear who it is marketed to besides the obvious party-goers
The 1 2 switch is Nintendo's undercover drinking game
Both the classic and the switch had/will have very high demand
I don't understand why they didn't get nes classic either
Also is gameworld not getting any?
I think as long as you go to stores early enough.
Dont they have to reserve some stock for non-preorders?
Unless you can rent it from gameworld
Why.
In the only one who will have one and I won't even have 1 2 switch
It's actually the same day Logan comes out
Yeah
They should make a Malo spin off game where you play as Malo and try to grow your shop empire
https://youtu.be/KyBC5OqapPo
Holy fuck i thought it couldn't get better but it did
Baby is very motivated to expand his franchise

zeldaception
I need to get some Zelda in today.
I'm running out of time.
I just defended some cows from an alien invasion last night
Me but probably not until around 8
I feel like most people become dicks when they get rich and famous
it requires 256 megs
maybe you dont have enough ram
96% positive
no it isnt
im pretty sure it gets cheaper than that on steam even
because all the good deals are on ps3
that sucks
can you buy those ps3 games on ps4?
ah yes goat simulator for only 4 dollars.
what a steal
and you dont want to look *that* dumb in front of your professor
well otherwise you would have to pretend you dont know anything about minecraft or its mods
but it was physical labor or something, not minecraft mods
and miss gouker
so did mr hayes
mr portle paid students to do stuff all the time
i would just do that for free.
seems weird to get paid by your professor to install minecraft mods
he deserves some credit for that
well he clearly made the correct assumption
wehat do you even say ronald
lol wtf
gives you a small gui for editing shadows in real time because otherwise you need to remember what each of their 4 pparameters do
yeah in dev tools
this is revolutionary
woah shit google chrome has a shadow editor
the fantasy plays a large role
but the show isnt just about politics
alright cool but remember ronald just doesnt think it belongs in a show about politics
also asher just because you personally dont like the fantasy in got doesnt mean that it's not one of the main focuses of the show
no one cares about your opinion
now it's just opinion
you guys are deviating from ronalds point
it doesnt matter, thats what got uses to add to the drama
ronald you're just describing house of cards
yeah and the growing threat of white walkers and dragons
i dont know what more you want  from them
and for 5 of those seasons the dragons were fucking babies
theyve destroyed like 3 cities
confirmed
lol
the only purpose they serve is to destroy shit and add to the lore
and not many people know about the 3 living ones
ronald the whole point of dragons in that show is that people think they are all extinct
also the whole thing is fantasy anyway, dragons are a main theme
im sorry but thats the best use of magic
he also doesnt like game of thrones because there's magic
it's an indication of how good it is
ronald did you see that scene
yeah and this video just keeps on replaying it
its the best because it's bonkers
what
https://youtu.be/eOR2KbFbAHU
good job everybody
thats intense
damn ronald has both amazon music and google music up at the same time
dont tell anyone
yeah boi
in the store
just copy the old nintendo ads
it's really too bad
so close
13.5 > 11
not to mention you get "bonuses" on one of your most purchased types of items
pretty dope
for every h he gets 11
i thought this was clear
11
it's a female clothing and furniture store
i love this guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7aotMarYQU
just wear the bee to the interview
plus you could go as a girl if you really needed to
yeah
h
fucking
11
still boring
oh
h?
sounds boring
should have stuck with the firefighter motif
i dont know if it really fits her lore.
i thought she was a firefighter
https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/821900007649329153
how do i have sex with this image
i think he used to play a lot of puzzle mobile games liek that
they are on mobile so ronald could have plakyed them
it's always cool when indie games get physical releases
wow thats pretty cool the binding of isaac afterbirth+ is getting a physical retail game release on switch
"ahh here's the problem.
too many toasters!"
sounds like a really hard gamet to make
it's awesome
their prime discount has really helped me out these past couple of days
did you do it at amazon
<:ronnieboy:232336989989371904>
........
....
but maybe he would like arms
i know but its going to be a while before it gets all the games that he brother wants such as smash
keenan i feel like we should make a console buying guide for ronald.
im worried hes not the most educated consumer here
and use for two-player
the little ones on the sides that you can take off
the switch controllers
whats more likely is the vive and oculus will just adopt the hd rumble into their controllers
not only will you be milking cows but you'll be immersed
ronald i dont know if you realize but the switch controllers have really advanced haptic feedback so it actually feels like you're milking an udder
that kind of shit is literally what nintendo does
but the customization features in that are far more robust than what weve seen with existing miis so it could be a sign of stuff to come for the new miis
also the miitomo smart phone app is literally all about miis
yeah there's footage
no they arent, there are some in mario kart
instead of bowling you are milking cows
1 2 switch is basically the same thing but weirder
no
it's not getting mario kart for example until april
yeah but does your brother want to play any of the launch games
or a bunch of indie games that you can get on steam
or just dance or skylanders
also ronald there's no reason to get a switch day one unless you want to play bomberman, snipperclips, 1 2 switch, or zelda
and i think most stores only have a certain pre-order allotment
well they are shipping 2 million consoles in the first month
occasionaly shit still opens up
you have to be on the lookout
yeah
motion controls are really good for aiming fps games so they ahve to be high quality
yeah its vastly improved
thats the key
its more of a hybrid portable-console
i wouldnt really compare it with the wii.
they dont emphasize the motion controls like they did with the wii but still include them for the option
yes
you're so immature
no wonder you play nintendo consoles
i dont know what you would do about the password to bypass it though
yeah i guess you could put it on yourself
oh
what
i love all these bowser parental controls memes
noo the ps4 owner just isnt trying hard enough
https://i.redditmedia.com/rpzK1NMiPwPL4N4ox2-dJdXUpEWCMR8RXJQg-ks9DbI.jpg?w=850&s=0f526a6f85d7210fc128b89b4f54f46e
yeah because you're like 9
Last week: Reggie: "Dont worry we haven't forgotten about out other IPs".
This week: Announces 4 new fire emblem games
now, i dont see i a use personally unless im importing from europe when they get something first
when they announced the switch was region free i would have been excited 7 years ago
and was pissed that the ds was region locked
i remember when black and white came out i was super pissed that japan got it so much sooner
but they do global releases so that doesnt matter anymore
the only games i could possibly play imported from japan are pokemon games
yeah but wouldnt they be in japanese
just novelty
whats the point
oh super famicom
sf?
asher might like it though
it feels like one of those games i cant appreciate without having played either smt or fe
ive heard of it and heard it was good but i never realied it was a fe/smt crossover
yea
wtf i just realized there;s a fire emblem x shin megami tensei game for wii u and it actually has very high ratings
different artists drew different dudes
anyway at least fire emblem mobile is coming to android first.
it has cool artwork
it's practically a nintendo select
nah dude nintendo puts it officially on sale for 20 pretty often
dude
also it has a killer soundtrack
it's probably relatively cheap now for a 3-4 year old game and one of the best ones
well if i ever got into fire emblem i would start with awakening
like main protagonists
lol why do you think there is such a huge cast of "famous" fire emblem heroes
but i meant that in a broad sense, the gameplay of both series stays teh same and what changes is what people care about so they keep playing them
they play it for the pokemon
i didnt mean people play pokemon for the lore
they might not offer very unique gameplay but it's the same reason people keep playing pokemon games
i mean i think if you're realy into the lore they would be worth playing
yeah they are good
which one
like sega might be doing with sonic
they arent just mass producing shit fire emblems
well the first two 3ds fire emblems had pretty high ratings
i mean like original titles
oras is a remake
like the second most popular game franchise ever
and also keenan it's fucking pokemon
no pokemon has 2
fucking crazy
not remakes or ports
can you believe the 3ds is going to have three (3!!!) mainline fire emblem games
well i guess i play mother
i think it would depress me to play a series that isnt being continued
i dont have it on gameboy so id have to get it
no but ive been wanting to for a while
yeah the tactics and the battle system are what intrigues me most
i didnt realize how anime it all is.
not that it's a bad thing, just when i played fire emblem on gameboy it wasnt advanced enough at the technical level to have all the voice acting and animated cutscenes that it does now
lol
i just want to figure out why it's such a popular jrpg
i wish i was more into fire emblem so i could be excited for this
i get that it's popular in japan but can it really be more popular than some of their other IPs in the west
why is nintendo making like 83 new fire emblem games but it takes like 5 years for an animal crossing game and like 7 for a metroid
like he might know about some warping glitch but not be good enough at the game to replicate it
usually the creators know everything about what they create
well you do have a point
he just plays it enough to make sure it's fun and stuff
there are other people to do that hardcore bug fixing
yeah but my point is he probably spends more time designing the game than extensively playing it
not some programmer or speedrunner
he's an artist by training
probably not very good
you never know
maybe it's just to be really good at mario 64
whats the meaning of life anyway
i mean it's a good psa for someone out there
woo
so i guess it serves a purpose on a micro level
it just doesnt benefit anyone except the people who also want to learn from him or those who find joy in casually watching his stuff
like this type of analytical skills and precision skills this mario 64 has are very valuable and he's really exercising them here
i think they are a good brain strengthening activity but of course there are probably better things you could do.
but no matter what you are doing there will always be some better option so it's pointless to think about it
because video games are more engaging which i think is better for the mind
but no one ever is the most efficient with their time
i dont really think video games are a waste of time, just maybe not the best use of it
i know im just saying what i think makes it interesting
so it's fun to watch for the cleverness
people who do these kinds of things are obviously very intelligent, they just arent putting those skills towards a practical use
ive never seen it before
da fuck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A
lol everyone is freaking out at the fact that gabe said the number 3
yo keenan you should play the metal gear hack and slash by platinum
otherwise you would be a criminal
you'd better
thats so mean
nickname?
ready
for some reason dota keeps crashing as soon as i launch it, so im going to restart steam
sure
it's an ultrabeast
this isnt a normal pokemon
no keenan that makes perfect sense
especially the lusamine music
yeah that part is super cool
did you already catch nebby
perhaps
the two options they could do wouldnt take much dev time compared to sun and moon
eh
which is before mario
pokemon usually comes in fall
or pokemon
skyward sword is pretty amazing
lol
dafuck nintendo
it says 1080p but it's clearly not
although i dont know why this youtube video is so low quality
this is going to be cool
im going to make it a wallpaper
i love the zelda light blasting the guardian gif so much
i can just play it next time i come over or something
because i dont want to borrow one thing without returning the other
i should probably do that first
i havent even touched chibi robo yet
maybe
make stuff more realistic ragdoll-like physics
i know team ico likes to do that in their games
and it's hard to aim my climbing
like horse steering is really hard
i think the emulator makes the game way harder.
the controls seem really imprecise but idk if thats what the game is supposed to be like or not
but you have to get to the fourth boy for me
yeah i will
i love breakdowns
yeah i saw
he's just like me
nick robinson cant stop talking about the switch on twitter
wtf there's a ratchet and clank show
emulator is not the ideal experience for this game
idk that aether foundation twist was pretty crazy and unexpected
ah
what ending
there's no point especially if all xbox one exclusives can also be played on pc
i feel like they should really stop making consoles
but i guess they never really did that well compared to everyone else
i always thought that was the one gen where microsoft did well
yeah i just looked at it for some reason i though the xbox sold a lot more than the ps3
i meant comparative to the other consoles in their gens
ya
i feel like it's like the gamecube, not a lot of people bought it but it has a really good game library
wow this metal gear really is a system seller
no
asher i want to play defense boys too
like stealth boys or over boys
we should play some games later
such as pocket monsters lunar
now you should play some actual good games
does anyone want to play dota <@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362>
So it looks like the team behind octopath traveler is the same as the bravely series
this needs to be in a real game
omg they're playing a jazzy version of the pokemon center theme
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufp4Dr7rNPU

i can call but my quality might not be great, i dont have my normal headset
yeah because you want to be productive
twitch.tv/gamesdonequick
is undertale about to start
they all hold up so well
but snes games are practically modern
its hard for me to play nes games
to play all the snes games
im just going to wait for the snes classic
in a race at a marathon while going for the longer route
both first and second place beat the 3rd and 4th placers' personal best
records https://www.speedrun.com/supermetroid#100
ya
good man
the man's favorite game from the last 25 years is pokemong gold and silver
i believe it
so really it must be just the technical different then
i mean with the same zelda style
oh well link to the past and oot are actually pretty similar
because the first two zelda games are pretty different from the rest
aside the fact that the solid games are 3d
how different are they from the solid games
but gameplay wise
oh ok
its probably like loz and loz the aventure of link, which had some core elements of the other loz games but where created really before any of the main lore or characteristics were established
i dont know how important the non solid ones are to the series
snakes revenge: "A sequel to the NES version of Metal Gear developed for the western market without the involvement of Hideo Kojima.
It is non-canon to the mainline Metal Gear series."
metal gear: the NES version features several changes from the MSX2 original,[61] and it is not considered part of the Metal Gear canon by series creator Hideo Kojima[4]
and then theres metal gear -nes and and snake's revenge after that also for nes
so theres metal gear - msx2, and metal gear 2 - msx2
they were developed without kojima
not according to this page
and mg1 and mg2 are only on msx2 and smart phones and wii ware
so the NES spinoffs of the non-solid first two metal gear games are not considered canon
so the order is like 3, pw, 5, 1, 2, 4
and then mgs 5 was a sequal to peace walker
mgs peace walker was a sequel to mgs3
mgs3 was a prequel
the story goes mgs1, mgs2, mgs4
ok so basically
jesus christ even the zelda series is more straightforward than this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Metal_Gear_media
the wikipedia seems to say it's only a remake of mgs1
so does mgs: the twin snakes have just mgs 1 or mgs 1 and 2
im so confused by all the mgs versions
why arent you playing the ps3 version
just gamecube and hd?
how many remasters of mgs are there
idk
or upgrades
or are they weapons
i didnt realize there were that many items
sometimes they are like digging throuhg blocks like terraria or somthing and other times they are jetpacking in the air
i dont understand metroid at all
wow Toby Fox just donated 10,000 dollars towards the undertale run
all about these three legendary heroes who were called out of retirement on a quest to bring the king's daughters to school
its a strategy based rogue-like that looks really fast paced
it's by frozenbyte and looks really neat
have you seen has been heroes btw
or maybe they just dont make the distinction when theres only really one popular way to do it
then wouldnt it say glitchless
idk if that means glitches or not
no 100%
its hard to watch this because there are 4 different people to watch and i dont understand metroid that much
thanks
what are the animals
whats so special about either of those two options
but what is save or kill the animals
like the race between saving and killing the animals is so damn close and people are throwing money at it to get their way
like right now only 37 dollars separates each goal
why are they such a big deal
and theyve gotten 700,000 towards either of those two options
gdq has the save the animals/kill the animals donation incentive/bet
so can you explain to me the super metroid speedrun craze
lol
what if there is saliva on it
ew a used zelda
i didnt realize gameworld did amiibos though
which is amazing
if you pre-order video game stuff and you have amazon prime you get a 20% discount
i got the sexy breath of the wild zelda
from the smash series?
why is super metroid like the most popular games done quick rrace
the anime girl simulation games for this thing are going to be crazy
to get the most milk
there's a very specific technique
people have described it as feeling like you're jerking someone off, not just in the gameplay but in the hd rumble
i hope youve seen videos of the milk game
you can actually count the number of marbles inside the controller for a minigame
the press has been saying that hd rumble is no joke
except for kimishima
every japanese dude they brought up was bonkers and dressed funny
except for the pres
oh yeah it was definitely nintendo
but not what it provides or what it costs
we dont know its internet capacity
thats a game that could have come right out of their show
well everyone is
they were both obsessed with snipperclips
listen to the first 20 min or so
i think i did
two systems you mean
ugh im trying to look for renditions of the arms music and the title is not easy to search for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUD0-1w0vCk&feature=youtu.be
i feel like a speedrun cant be more than an hour for it to be a good viewing experience and a good length for practicing
like windwaker
to speedrun i mean
its crazy that people speedrun games that take as loong as 4 hours
i wish i had the time to play that many games
lol
yeah but you probably didnt just preorder a switch and a 100 dollar botw set and like 3 amiibos
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_NHtszXzX0
https://i.redd.it/jkdki7i6uo9y.jpg
translucent plastic
this is such a beautiful controller https://twitter.com/LaurakBuzz/status/820252432957636610
and bomberman
also the new game arms has really good music too
it does
i like the music in that trailer
is shin megami tensei supposed to be a scary game because that penis would be pretty scary
wow you're right
i got like 3 of them because im dumb
botw amiibo are up on amazon if anyone cares about those
this is a little weird https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/820093637258190849
no i can tomorrow though

It also has tradition button controls if you want
It's literally an over the shoulder third person super hero fighting game
Looks really good
You guys should watch the Arms gameplay on the treehouse stream
all the japanese studios seem to be putting out hype games
lol
when they come out with other colors
also my secondary joycons will be colored
no im not cool enough
hopefully they have midnight release in bloomington
yeah i did on bestbuy
playstaion youtube might not do live streams
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuC4YLLkqME
its on youtube and twitch
beautfiul
that click though
ugh the stream is playing the trailer sounds
lol maybe i should unmute this chat
they are all beautiful in their own ways
i dont like critiquing games
lol
and they are all plagued by dated mechanics and some design flaws
and they are all plagued by dated mechanics and some design flaws
and they are all plagued by dated mechanics and some design flaws
yeah but all the old collectable games have those things
You have to be some kind of ♥♥♥♥ing stupid to design that Psycrow boss fight.
Bland, uninspired 3D platformer similar to Banjo-Kazooie, and by that I mean it's more or less a complete and utter ripoff.
The platforming stages are decent enough but the boss fights are ATROCIOUS: you and your opponent duke it out in an exciting contest of...
collecting orbs scattered about in the arena.
With really awkward controls, the boss constantly shooting you causing you to drop your orbs, and the fact that you still have your health to worry about (whilst the boss can take as many shots they want without even caring) all combine to create a really unpleasant experience.
Could very well be one of the worst games ever made.
Gameplay, controls, camera angles, plot....everything.
This game is to the Earthworm Jim saga is what the first Hulk movie was to the marvel movies.....best be forgotten.
apparently just the music files are missing but that can be fixed
lol the reviews are funny
and also not the best game on top of that
looks like it might be a bad port
i wonder why it only has 55% positive
yeah
earthworm jim 3d
i think it's on pc too
also super mario 3d world is basically a collection game except with a time limit, and a linear level structure
ive started sunshine just havent gotten around to really playing it through yet
shit i never made that connection before
makes sense because it was made by the same people
it was literally a collectable game except a racer instead of a platformer
actually i think thats why i liked diddy kong racing so much
which is basically yookalaylee
if they made remakes or refreshed them with modern mechanics  would definitely play
but im really looking forward to yooka laylee though
they just seem kind of dated for me
why is also why im pretty sure i would really like those old n64 collecting games
i like looking at the levels in detail and trying to find secrets
no i understand that but i treat mario like an exploration game
but then how can you sightsee
which is why i dont understand how you can play the new mario games without getting the coins
i can get 60 hours out of mario be a) being bad and b) trying to get at least 60-70% of the collectables
i do that sort of with majoras mask, use a walkthrough to make sure im being hte most effecient with my time.
but i still do my own puzzle solving and boss fighting and whatever because thats the fun part.
and unlike long plays on youtube, walkthroughs dont spoil story or cutscenes
also they have a lot of replayability
i mean the mario games are short but only if you're good.
since i suck they take a lot longer
it could be a 10 hour campaign as long as it somehow has 50 more hours of additional content
i cant justify that price
yeah exactly
only if im paying 10 dollars for them
as you've made abundantly clear
same reason im excited to start a bunch of new games without finishing stuff first
people are usually more motivated to play new stuff rather than finish the old stuff
basic math
yeah because one is a 10 hour game and the other is a 40 hour game that you spend 100 hours on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnX42OHnuLA
not everything fits perfectly
sure but theres no better category to put those games in
technically clash of clans and those games are the most popular rts games right now
i dont think pvp is what defines an rts
there is in pikmin 3
neat
and halo wars 2
which is why games like pikmin change the rts genre
those are the only ompetitive rtses but not the only ones
but you can probably speed run it
which isnt competitive
and pikmin
yeah i'll keep up with too i guess, seems intriguing
i dont know how any rtses work with a controller besides pikmin
but if it's slower paced and has that combat system it could work with a controller i guess but idk how
which means it has to be mouse keyboard like a traditional rts
well it will also be on pc
and the building
i like the civs
what do we like about aoe
no one liked aoe3
sounds like p2w
so is it turn based or what
im sure i would
i dont really know how aoe and starcraft compare but whatever
so aoe but with halo skin
what was halo wars 1 like
oh nvm thats the rts one
what about it
no the next fire emblem is just going to be a moba but when you die you are permanently out of the remaining 45 minute long game
except for fire emblem (yet)
intelligent systems has this weird habit recently of suddenly chaning the formula for all their games that have a formula proven to work
yeah you're right the last warioware was like 2009.
i was thinking of game and wario but i guess thats not warioware
there needs to be a wario ware for mobile devices because it's the best platform for it
but they are still making warioware games
that would be fun
we all know how much the market is just craving an ice climbers sequal
we could make ice climbers
or
give a story mode
a new game hasnt come out in years
there's so much potential for a spiritual bomberman successor
please
can we just make bomberman
shit
i feel like tons of minesqeeper remakes have been tried
also studying game design is a lot different from normal computer science because you focus on learning the popular engines like unity and unreal which take a lot of experience and isn't like normal code
no
no but with a game design degree they might not make indie games but just get hired from some other company
well to be fair you never hear about 99% of games that are created
ya
or is it only serious game design major
ronald does unc have a game design major
Serious games: from Pokemon Go to Black Ops 3 in 1 semester
thats what that class turns you into ronald
yeah he seemed pretty serious
what are you taking this semester?
oh im just taking honors serious games
is there a course called "non-serious games" otherwise known as "games"
to the outside audience
for some reason i dont think you'll actually be making "serious" games.
it seems like just a facade to make a normal game dev course seem more legit

what aspect triggers you
lol
"Finally, if people are going to play games, perhaps we can give them some games with
additional value beyond entertainment (think classics vs.
romance novels)."
"Serious Games" lol
i would try it
keenan maybe next semeseter i'll have a free slot idk
why is it hard to get into
which isn't coding
you would probably be learning the unity or something
it would be fun but it's probably not a lot of coding
ez
like how early
grapefruit is my least favorite flavor
that is true
wtf i just realized we have a 3 day weekend already
👍
its not that i dont care about the plot it's just that i need to go through it more than once to completely understand it.
but most games only play the cutscene once
yeah and sometimes i find it hard to focus completely on the plot
yeah i do
yeah which is cool
it's why i tend to like newer games because they always have the latest and greatest production value
if it's animated well thats fine but it's more about how it's integrated into the overall game and its feel
it's cool but i mean in games the overall quality of the production value is what interests me.
so like how the cutscene is integrated with the rest of the gameplay and music and level design
i appreciate cool technical stuff
any game can have a good story but not all games have cool cutscenes
because design and programming is basically that
if they played them a second time, i would watch again for the story
im serious ctuscenes fascinate me in every way except for the story part
you get to see camera angles that you normally dont get to see
whenever i watch a cutscene i am too engrossed by the technical aspects of it like the camera and music and voices to pay attention to what it says
i wish games replayed cutscenes
like my Q101 professor studied history and the philosophy of science, animal behavior, and machine morality
you dont see professors who say they study "cognitive science", you say you study what psecifically you do in cog sci such as computational neuroscience, or cognitive neuroscience, or human evolution, or language development, artificial intelligence, or whatever
whereas cog sci is interdisciplinary and covers psych, neuroscience, comp sci, linguistics, antropology, etc...
basically all aspects of the brain.
so how it evolved, it's structure, how people learn, and how people think and behave (and the last part is basically psych)
psych is pretty focused
psych is more the study of the mind and its functions, and it's most about how the mind and mental attitudes affects behavior
cog sci is more the study of thought and learning, basically the study of intelligence (And anything connected to intelligence
because i have too much to fit in
because i almost never take optional stuff
which says something
i took it even though it's optional for majors
it's a really interesting class
very little exception
in comp sci most the ais are indian males
most of my ais have been dudes
cog sci doesn thavve uis
i mean ai
im sure shes the most attractive cog sci ui
probably
i also skipped like half of the lab sections which werent mandatory
so thats good
and gave me good grades
she graded all my stuff though
she is although i never really interacted with her much
see was my ai last sem for a class
yeah
for me q101 was a fascinating class so you might want to pay attention anyway
but you have a different professor
when i took it a large part of the class was participation and reading responses
in the past the grade dist for that class is between 20-35% A
my class had 60
it wasnt hard because i paid attention
its not a hard class
its also esy to just pay  atenntion
i cant tutor people who dont pay attention
keenan you should get into katamari speedrunning
damn right it does
isnt 5?
i wasnt sure
is that mgs a fps
they even kept them for the 3ds version
i thought the great fairies were
lol
it'e weird to speed run a game with so many other ocmpetitive aspects
if you are going to put this much time into pokemon i dont think it should be speedrunning
maybe you just had poor item management
cant you buy some
also i like emerald because it's one of the few games they speed run that i actually know all the mechanics of
why cant you get more hp
what boss
no
it's a lot of rng
i just want to get a gist for the general strats
yeah its not the best genre for a speed run
i want to see what it's like when there are actual battle mechanics
ive never watch a pokemon speed run before outside of gen 1
speed run
?
pokemon emerald run boys
the only reason i dont want to play minecraft right now is that i wont have time for other games
monkey ball speedruns are so cool
yeah it's just demotivating
maybe they can reuse the assets and stuff for something else though
it seems like a huge waste of time and resources if that game never launches
guys guess what emerald speed run coming soon
they could sell them
but if you cancel the game what are you going to do with the rights
i wonder if some other publisher will pick it up if they can
i feel like scalebound had to be close to being done though
which is why ps4 has so many more exclusives
yeah i doubt anyone really wants to work with microsoft
it will probably have a good soundtrack
not many open world rpgs are
it seemed cool that it was 4 player co-op
i dont even care about the game i just feel bad for the devs
yea
their super ambitious game that was 4 years in development just got canceled by microsoft
its pretty sad what's happening to platinum games right now
from his website " Fundamentals of formal language theory, computation models and computability, the limits of computability and feasibility"
and proofs
im not exactly sure as he hasn't posted the syllabus yet but it's all math
lol we just spent the first lecture of my computing thoery class on why the imitation game moive is bullshit
Lol the most I've ever seen is 5%
attendance cant be that much
sounds like a joke
is it a coll-c class
why do you have to take those classes
i'll probably just do target since they open the soonest
so the switch cant be any worse than that
the wii seems like the hardest
i didnt get the wii u at launch but i bet it was easy as well due to low demand
but there was a lot less hype for that
although at the bloomington gamestop the 3ds was easy to get at launch day
ugh i think it will be pretty hard to get a switch preorder this week
american ads just suck though
japan and europe still have good ads
pokemon used to have much better marketing than it does now in the u.s.
he was both, but only president of pokemon USA
back when pokemon was good
yeah wasnt he pokemon company president
i wonder if he established this precendent with ppizza hut
there's probably some rule about it hidden in the fine text of the ceo contract
and then i have class at 4
im just in my lab from now until 3
iwata was a bboy who liked to have fun
he doesnt seem like the type
im ready to see super stern and business looking  new ceo Kimishima bust out on the stage like this  https://media.giphy.com/media/onJLFHU3GVSG4/giphy.gif
is that what it's being called these days
😦
lol
why not
this ad mockup is so cool though https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C1vi766XEAAL65r.jpg

they speedrun some really obscure games
holy shit this thing lasts a week
cant speedrun undertale without knowing the strats
do you know when it is
i'll watch it
lol
undertale
everyone shoul d be watching AGDQ that just started
k

<@!127535721857679362> <@!125452744440938497> dota ?

<@!155893986605793281> is ronald playing
<@!125452744440938497> dota?
Keenan is holding me hostage
I am online
So you were close enough
No that happens at 6am
where's ronald
i dont see how monaco takes emotional energy but not dota
yeah but i think when keenan and ronald got home they wanted to play monaco
<@127535721857679362>  https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5l1wo3/alexa_doesnt_quite_understand_this_kid/

are you at home again
<@!127535721857679362>
or that new game but keenan isnt here
preferrably dota
i can play wjatever
Yeah thanks it seems good
Seems cool
I got it since it's only 5
It looks hard
Adaptive soundtracks are really hard to listen to
Is that the boss fighting game
are superhero movies really planned out this far in advance http://comicsalliance.com/files/2014/10/CA_Supermovies_10-28-2014-21.jpg
lol
"just because they are technically separate companies, Atlus in Japan will bring Personal 5 Portable to Nintendo Switch in Q2, which has all the DLC plus some exclusive content including what I've heard as guest appearances from the #FE characters as Personas.
Atlus are looking into releasing P5P on the same day in the US as the other versions. "
the only third party partnership deals i trust with nintendo systems are square enix and ubisoft
seems like crazy talk here
"Nintendo has given EA and Criterion Games a dream offer: Having Nintendo and Disney help fund, distribute and quality control a spiritual successor to the Star Wars Rouge Squadron series exclusive for the Nintendo Switch after 2017."
yeah no
"which might have special costumes and a guest Nintendo character everyone would freak out for"
i highly doubt that
also this guy says activision blizzard will be have an overwatch port at launch
but maybe since nba 2k was in the trailer
it doesnt really feel like something they would do
"Nintendo plans on partnering with 2K Sports to created a new kid-friendly wrestling game based on the WWE Slam!
series using Amiibo of popular wrestlers.
Plans to release late 2017, early 2017.
System will launch with NBA2k 17 March Madness Edition, a enhanced port of NBA2k with a new "STREET" multiplayer mode and updated rosters.
2k Games also might bring Boarderlands 3 to the system depending on how well they see the Nintendo Switch ecosystem do."
like wtf is this:
and literally its proabbly 90% bs
some random "marketing insider" on reddit posted
im reading some of the most insane rumors for the switch i've ever seen
yeah i can
i know there's a big quest you start there or something and i was waiting until i start that
ok i havent really explored the hotel much
idk what you mean
he saves them once and then forgets
my link just doesnt give a shit
my representation of link doesn't have that character trait
yeah the poor gorons deserve to be unfrozen immediately after playing the song of time in every instance of the three day cycle
it's just annoying
he wasn't even hard i didnt take any damage when fighting him
since it's the third day and i dont have enough time
im already kind of annoyed at the fact that i have to rebattle Goht in order to get the sword upgrades
i like feeling powerful in that i have a new sword spin attack that i'll probably never use
yeah but i hate doing things twice so if im going to do them at all it's going to be the first time
wtf
how
but i do mind having to walk back trhgouh an entire dungeon because i fell off a platform
i dont mind dying to a hard boss
and the fact that the mask transition animation is too long i wish it was instant especially considering how frequently you have to transform in some parts
the only issues i have so far is that some parts are frustratingly difficult.
like navigating snowhead trying to collect all the fairies since i kept falling off of platforms, and all the timed sections like the hot spring water that doesnt give you a timer and you have climb that dumb ladder every time it runs out
who tried to make excuses for him forgetting the lullaby for his son 😦
i thought the deku king was cool and then i found the goron elder
every character
literally every chracter in te game is perfect
everything about the goron questline was amazing though
oh i havent gotten powder kegs yet so i can only go to the ranch on the third day
no i dont know where that is
he got to see all his baby cucoos grow up
i made that dudes final day
yeah my favorite one so far was marching the chicks to get the bunny mask
i just need a long cooldown period
it's going to take me a week to beat each of the remaining two dungeons in majora even though i really only do it in one sitting for one day
especially majora's mask
but those games are so draining
i really need to finish the zelda series though as my first priority
i will
it looks like a really good game
you guys both have ps4s so you should get dragon quest builders
im not sure if others do that too but that seems like a more modern thing
like difficulty and encounter rate
also the bravely games have settings you can adjust on the fly
i feel like i can manage
paper mario and the mario rpg's combat system is really cool in its own way
yeah which makes me think i should be playing them a lot more than i am
i also really like the strategic element of pokemon battles, since it's somethingi can be good at without relying on mechanical skill or timing ability and whatnot
i just like how when your people die they die forever
but proabbyl because it's more of a strategy game than an rpg
ive played fire emblem and i like that
i know everything is in terms of story
i mean in terms of battle system
alright no nothing is better than pokemon
the two things i like the most in pokemon are the battles and the story arc (which i know isn't that complex i just like becoming the very best)
well im also looking for the turn based battle systems
as long as the story is at least as good as pokemon
i just want something epic
havent played ff either
yeah that's what i gather
it also has a really good ost
i think i would like them
that ive never played
im not saying it's the best im just saying out of all the genres on the 3ds it seems like there are a ton of good jrpg games
which is like it's strongest suite
im sort of just realizing now that i really missed out on a lot of the jrpg and rpg library of 3ds
well idk if i would want to play them im just wondering
are they good
btw has anyone played bravely default or  bravely second
wait i dont understand
On Twitter rtz said he was it was just a joke but idk if the tweet was specifically in reference to that
Good 3 part video https://youtu.be/l_rvM6hubs8
I'm actually really tired so i don't think I'll play tonight
Does anyone want to play anything

how
this is the best video ive seen in a while https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkHtziJgFJI

oh wow
what about her

almost as good as the architecture in the last guardian
spoilers jesus
https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5jseyq/when_you_are_the_halo_soundtrack/
+
Dishonored is probably just like batman
Hold on Keenan let me save
It's not a fps rpg though
I read reviews for a bunch of random stuff
Yeah I would
Yeah
ronald are you ready
do we have time for a game?
ok im updating
<@!127535721857679362> <@!125452744440938497> dota?
ready?
<@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362> dota?
which is why i said fourth gen
i agree with that
it's just that the earlier games lack some quality of life features thats you may miss if you play one of the newer ones first
you aren't going to find a bad pokemon game
they are all good
ok really an argument could be made for any gen
nah why
i recommend platinum
good because you shouldn't play moon first
Literally super meat boy https://youtu.be/1mFA_Gc5BWs
I don't even know.
what email
can you check in any way
which i hope still exist online for your card
im also going to have to install drivers
if you dont we should make one
keenan do you have a microsoft account?
i haven't put in a code yet
you might be able to tie it to a windows account now though
i always forget what you can and cant do
yeah i dont mind as long as we can figure out how windows installation works
or wii
fucking xenoblade on the 3ds
like look at all the shit nintendo crams into their tiny disk/cartridge sizes
consoles are different though, more compression is required for them
i feel like devs could compress their games a lot more if they try, they just dont because they know everyone has tons of space
which is the ost ive ever seen for a game
the witcher 3 is 65 gigs
depends on the game.
i also uninstall every game im not using
if i installed my entire steam library i dont think it would be 1tb
which is all this computer is used for i think
i haven't ever heard of anyone filling up 1TB with games yet
which is part of the reason he doesnt need space
yeah but keenan doesnt need space
but im pretty sure you can tie a windows activation to your account now
i'd imagine with this hard drive though it will ask to activate windows 10 when i log in
do you just want to borrow my hard drive keenan until you get a better one?
i dont really care about it.
it's like the same brand and model as your old one so it's not going to be any better and i'd recommend getting a new 50 dollar 1 TB one at some point, and whenever you do i can help you install windows and drivers on it
alright i have windows installing
everything else is literal trash
no the best mobile game ever is threes or tilt to live
im just saying it's surprisingly fleshed out and you can tell that was nintendo's main idea for content in an otherwise level-limited game
you dont have to even get farther in a level than someone to beat them
there's a whole plethora of ways to earn points
it's not just time trial though
but apparently it's multiplayer features are pretty good so maybe if i had a bunch of friends with the game, there would be good competitive incentive to replay stuff
i dont every replay stuff in games
to be honest, im not even the type of person to like a game like that either
lol
but they've justified the price in many other ways
no of course not but the game isn't just the levels, if it were, then nintendo would be smart enough to put way more levels in to justify the price
it's clearly a bait
i dont know why you even started this conversation in the first place then, you knew what i was going to say
just look at the reviews keenan
i've also watched a bunch of gameplay footage of the full version
but at least i know what you can do in it
i havent played the full version
just watch gamexplain's review, they address all the major concerns i personally had with it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w8B2ElzmvI
i feel like you dont really understand the full scope of the game
and completing challenges
you get more tickets by playing
no
and also toad rally is where most of the replay value is after you do all the single player stuff
the whole point is going through and getting every version
im pretty sure thats the bulk of the replay value.
everyone can get the first 5 coins for each level in 10 minutes
you mean all iterations of the 5 pink coins?
call coins?
not many levels but tons of replayability
it has great online features
it is but so is mario run
ok
are any mobile games fun for you though
you just dont want to like it
no but i tried rebooting
Which should be able to be done later
Oh yeah maybe.
OK then I might be able to install windows without activating
Can you send my your Windows activation code
No it's not worth it.
My hard drive is also old and only 80gb
if it works, i can format my linux drive and put windows on it
and see what that does
well im going to install another hard drive i have that has linux
im not even trying to boot from it, just trying to read its contents
i have it running externally and it tries to boot up, makes some clicking noise, then turns off
<@!155893986605793281> yeah hard drive definitely busted
just power and the monitor cable
nah
and relevant cables
and the flash drive
k
that could work but it woudl have to be later since my mom has a bunch of people over right now
when ronald pointed it out
but i didnt think of that until last night
i also could have taken your hard drive home with me
whenever you want
<@!127535721857679362> are you really online ronald?
can you play
and just listen
like the old days
you can join the call
yay
in 500 years it will be like the colosseum of bloomington
it's inevitable
but seriously that building does need to get renovated at some point
they wouldn't shut it down just build a new ballantine right next to it
well first ballantine needs a $15mil donation
how much can they really improve that would take three years to do
why do they need three years
it already looks nice
i go there every thursday too but not for art but for meetings
it only took a year to renovate the media school in franklin hall
why's it take them three years to renovate
woah i didnt realize the art museum will be clkosed for three years after this may
and i can watch
you can also play stardew valley
oh yeah
if you did have your computer what game would you play with us
ANYONE WANT TO PLAY GAME
How does one just come into money
No
Can we all play triforce heroes?
I need two other people to complete that game
Hey guys i can play in like 10 min
does anyone want to play dota? <@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362>
ok
eayh give me like 10 minutes
https://discord.gg/DVzHD
guys
this is pretty hype: https://blog.discordapp.com/year-end-teaser-search-screen-share-video-chat-audit-logs-and-channel-organization/
theyr dont last long
they're meant to be replaceable
regardless of if they are wired or wireless
thats true of all cheap headphones
its not as simple
wireless tech has so many more breakable components though
and you have to charge them
cheap ones are especially finnicky
because the hassle isn't worth it
i thought we already told you that bluetooth earbuds arent worth it
i love amazon support
lol
come play dota
<@!125452744440938497> do you want to play dota
Does this mean you can't play overwatch until the hard drive comes
And if you are ever planning on getting a new computer at some point you can just re use the same ssd
An SSD is the single best upgrade you can apply to make an old computer faster
If you can afford it, you can also consider using this opportunity to get an ssd
I think that's what I did with Windows 10 education edition from iu
Yeah
Yeah
You're going to need windows too

I dont think I understand why this is so funny
I just realized I can get a 66% on my final paper and still get an A in the class.
There goes my motivation...
but it's completely different
yeah that was called box dude or something
i will finish boxboy and boxboxboy over break as well
going to be hype
at least for japan
but there's an amiibo coming soon
well yeah because it's hal
it's like HAL made an indie game
lol
HAL is genius
anyways it's fucking genius
i dont think so
keenan have you heard of boxboy?

like idk how you can use any apps on the appstore and not have at least one game at all
true but mobile gaming is just so widespread
crazy
although idk if candy crush is an mmo
or candy crush
or that one drawing game that used to be popular
not even like words with friends
liike not even those really big fad ones
does she play mobile games
i figured that since so many games are mmo, the appeal of them is obvious so i assumed you were explaining the more specifc reasons for mmorpgs
yea
i didnt read your thing properly
nvm that
ive forgotten the appeal of mmos
what about origins
i think they are just animated versions of the major cutscenes from each gen
i dont thin kthey suck
i dont think they would make sense without the games
they have no story
i always thought of him more as a hippie dragon but i see the grandpa now
= grandpa
drampa = grampa
i just realized
people apparently think dunsparce is related to drampa
HOW
AH
rip
does she at least know pikachu
i think you mean this
😦
i hope this is the type of analysis we do on video games
it looks likea  spoiler
is that a spoiler
?
i want a poster of it
the cover art of majora mask 3d is so beautiful btw
which will also happen friday
I keep Majora's mask next to me at all times when I'm studinyg to remind me of my goals
Dont worry I'll play starting Friday
dont worry at some point the server will make a brief revival for a couple months and then end when the next dota/overwatch update comes out
(thats the true reason im not playing with you, so you finsih pokes)
I think we are supposed to satisfy all of keenan's mutliplayer gaming needs but we dont even play overwatch with him
I just realized that the gamemakers toolkit guy has a real resume and isnt just making youtube vids for fun
im literally immune to fear
why not me
but it wasnt dota
i need to study, i would have played 3 hours ago
i would like to play one game of doto if anyone is interested
also he has an ugly colored santa hat
his skin isnt even legendary though
lucio
but i dont play any of those dudes
like winston and pharah and reaper
i guess i like the ice themed ones
i havent looked at that yet
halloween was much cooler
i guess i dont really like holiday themed stuff
i dont like any of the overwatch skins
probably because you have a pinterest
polygon images dont work
link?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7bPQTpCAt8
Route 216 in platinum was the best
yeah the only thing you have to worry about is it's sometimes harder to see other pokemon trainers
wow Rime is coming to the Switch.
I didn't realize that Sony no longer owned it
ok i might play two then
^
asher you ready?
and evasion
is it the 10% magic boost
i dont understand what makes him viable
i want to do carry tree
whats new with centaur?
i have a list
ugh i cant decide what hero to play
if they put a high noon reference in sniper's ult it would be crazy
lol
https://twitter.com/EternaLEnVy1991/status/808475397675515904
yeah ive been watching it on and off
talent trees replace normal attribute leveling so it's not really a power creep either
they really didnt buff/nerf heroes that much, and it's mostly the same as 6.88
and they change the map like every patch
true but the only things you really have to learn are the backpack (which is simple) and the new map
plus when was the last time we actually try harded in dota, i think it's become more fun to not focus on the meta and just do clowny shit
you dont have to keep track of anything because tooltips exist
even morphling got some interesting buffs, at lv 25 you can either get +400 waveform range or +30% replicate damage
and techies seems really strong
mirana can actually be a really strong right click carry now
ronald i dont think you realize but all your heroes got buffed
lol
thats like an entire modern AAA game
6.6 GB patch wtf
path live! <@!125452744440938497> want to play a quick game?
and i already have a runescape account
you already missed the night we got into hots
yeah because there havent been any patches and it got stale
nah im just going to get really good at all of ronald's heroes and it will be the same as it always was
we can just make good bots
that way we dont actually have to be good at dota
but we could compete in bot tournaments
it's really not that much harder
yeah lets make dota bots, they just opened up the API
k
can we do earlier in the day so i can play dota at night
keenan on friday or saturday do you want to play twilight
i thought grades were due on monday
but why do you need so much storage
understandable
as long as you have a custom passphrase for the umail
you just log into google drive with your umail
iu does
it gives you unlimited google drive storage
?
it gives you unlimited drive
iu gives you unlimited
but why
so you aren't getting the best personal assistant possible with echo
also ronald, google will always have the best AI
why would you ever use the dot's features if you arent part of the amazon ecosystem and dont have any smart lights/thermostats/etc
they also will be better quality than echo dot for probably less money
all he says is lol and then immediately goes offline.
classic <:ronald:230126993008623616>
and pineapple princess
i think it's just fallout radio songs
google home and the bigger echo are designed to be good speakers but the echo dot definitely is not designed for that
like the big echo is
it's also not designed to be a good speaker
i think the echo dot is too small to be a good speaker
the echo is not the useful unless you are either already integrated into the amazon app ecosystem or have a lot of smart home appliances
i'd rather wait until the next gen of home personal assistant devices
i
yeah i dont think his voice should have been that low
https://twitter.com/matthewmercer/status/808218055834615808
i think im going to get really good at morphling to make up for ronald
these dota terrains just keep getting better and better
aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvMcA-FCViE&feature=youtu.be
ahhh so cool https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqtkfCLjJz4
just make them all on top of snorlax's belly
who cares about scale
snorlax
he doesnt need to walk on the ground because he can just jump through trees
ugh monkey king is so cool
if you download it, does it show all at once
idk i think it's neat
i normally dont know the order in which to read comic panels
oh i thought that was kind of neat
idk what that means
how do i use a cbr file
also for some reason the clicking to advance doesnt work for me
which comic?
there are two
there's some cool art and comics on this page http://www.dota2.com/700/monkeyking/
there are new ways to play every hero plus monkey king is so coolest hero ever created
ugh im still so hyped for dota though
i want kukui/royale and cynthia and steven
if red and blue go well you should draw some of the other trainers too
that would be so cool
so we will need to be playing that for the sweet limited time loot boxes
overwatch will be having a holiday event
oh and dont forget
he doesnt like it when dota changes too much but i think thats the whole point
because ronald was overwhelmed and quit
true but really i can only play dota when asher is online
not all the time though
plus i think i can beat links awakening in only 10-15 hours
im really really hyped for majora and twilight
like dota at night, zelda in the day, and other stuff in the mornings
i'll just have to make a schedule
im still going to aim for my goal of one zelda game per week over break
i wont be able to play until after finals but rip zelda dreams
the patch comes out tomorrow but we get to watch people play it on the testing client
woah if you destroy the tree that monkey king is standing on, it stuns him for 4 seconds
yeah a lot of people told me to watch that
yeah me too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMGlylXwY_8
didnkt think about that
bulba just brought up a good point about stacking
yay im so excited for timber
because if you are 50% hp or less you can not only deny yourself, but also silence them
suicide is way better now
i have no idea what techies is anymore
lol
i see talents as just something new and fun to try out
i doubt it but ok
you cant handle the change
thats exactly what i told asher when this came out lol
its only 30 gold at max level
its the best part
i dont know why you're afraid of change in a game that hasn't had a new patch for 9 months
it's so beautiful
that range
lol
puuuuck
could give her some useful aoe in teamfights though
😦
i cant wait to try it
that doesnt even sound that bad
damn i didnt notice the pa lv 25
so thats another cool choice you'll have to make
it's interesting that the talents prevent you from leveling up a normal skill on that level
because it's like they are all new
i want to go back and relearn every hero now
ugh
it looks so fun
asher this patch has so much potential
it's so useful how they show everything
are you watching slack's stream too?
LOL
WTF
mirana gets 3 arrows at level 25
the game is constantly changing and becoming new again
because thats the appeal of dota
and it looks insanely fun
it's a new game
ronald 7.00 shouldve been called dota 3 but valve cant count to 3
like there's a slider that indicates your current morph from str to agi
?
wtf at lv 25 legion gets +58 damage per duel
<@!127535721857679362>
+30% Replicate Damage
+400 Waveform Range
RONALD MORPH:ING HAS A SLIDER
dota will never be the same
i need help
<@!125452744440938497> call?
icefrog just tweeted!
https://twitter.com/IceFrog
http://www.dota2.com/700
patch hype!
im pretty sure the only valve event to go to game 5 in the finals was ti3
it's also cool to see a team win 3 times
ehh
against that ES
i also think it was a huge problem that no one on OG got bkbs
lol
i think the rubick made more plays with disruption, omnislash, and arrow, than the actual mirana, sd, and jugg combined
holy shit yeah
this is the best support play ive ever seen
<@!125452744440938497> i hope you are watching this game
omg thug is so good at puck
s4 helps og 5 man wipe ad finem at 6 minutes in and proceeds to get regen rune
wow
But I secretly want ad finem to win
Hopefully DC does well because they make up the rest of my draft
I picked them as my bracket winners, but I relied heavily on eg for my fantasy draft
Or maybe you hate them just because they knocked out eg
Lol but they all seem like nice people
Why
COME
<@!127535721857679362>
ive never seen a team look so genuinely happy
their victory popoffs are insane
ad finem are so cool
Alright I'm trying to finish minish cap anyway
sure
this spidey trailer
why is iron man in this
this is a hype matchup happenign right now
that boy isn't in moon
how
wait
we need to have a 3ds lan party
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2m3NgZk7eE
i can finally watch this major and the level of play is insane
holy shit <@!125452744440938497> i forgot how interesting watching dota was.
even when it's two teams i dont really have preferences for
I see the whole point of mobile games as something to play when you don't have internet
Data doesn't work on plane or subway
Dumb mobile games
Rip mario run.
Internet connection required at all times to play
http://imgur.com/ZazsACZ
Whats happening I can't watch any dota
this ruins all my predictions
it looks like np might lose to ehome
gameplay
but whats gaemple like
no
like machinarium
would this be like a point and click adventure/puzzle game
what kind of programming is required for a dating sim
I love this man https://youtu.be/V17tXBePgfo
best port
usb-c confirmed fuck yes
omg they also had miyamoto playing the guitar
reggie just brough the switch to jimmy fallon
holy shit
as well as a fleshed out hierarchy for moderator roles
they have legit channels for every game and an "afk lounge" for whatever
also they take it way more seriously
they are way more extreme
eh not really
instead of, you know, punctuation or something
for emphasis or whatever
this
like
every message
type
they
that
is
as i think is the case with every young one
the tmain difference is
they are the same way
i pop into my borther's discord channel occassionally and it is very dry compared to ours
/r/onaldjokes
trying to explain our discord to other people is hard
<:sadboy:230133848740986891>
<:happyboy:230130509630406656>
<:ronald:230126993008623616>
<:preciousboy:234377704261156865>
I agree
<:dicksout:230132771094396938>
<:perfectangel:230127369728425984>
<:perfectangel:230127369728425984>
because it's like if the gba could play current gen console games like gamecube and ps2 as well
but it's way better than that
?
which is definitely me
that even if the switch starts off with mostly ports and a good vc library, people will be way more willing to rebuy games they already own than what is typically the case with ports on new consoles, just because it's portable
also the thing is
the best one
same with mario party 7?
whatever the gamecube mario party is
like at other people's houses
ive played double dash but not seriously played it
it started with the gba
luigi mansion, ttyd, sunshine, double dash
that ive never played
too many good gc games
rip wallet
ugh there's a good chance gamecube will be on switch virtual console
Keenan only operates in terms of cuteness though
I think coolest is decidueye
there's another 30 min documentary on him too that im watching now
i watched that for the first time a week ago and it was so sad
better watch this for the feels https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUHi-vlACJI
it's iwata's birthday today
yeah
it's been out for 4 days
did you get mario maker yet
yeah everyone always forgets about chesnaught
i feel like your top list changes every dfay
did you catch your oranguru
so much expression
just look at that face
beautiful
just level up
mudbray?
who is donkey boy
i used to have him on my team but he didnt suit my power needs
he's a real cool boy
oh well you have to use it in battle
what level is yours?
i think one only evolves at night and the other in the day
morelull
fomantis and morrelul are pretty standard
salandit only evolves if it's female
raichu?
lol
although charjabug is competitively  viable if you put an eviolite on him
yeah
fourth island
actually no wait
thats post game
need to level it up on a mountain on the 3rd island
you cant until the end of the game
https://i.imgur.com/GfSFBE0.gifv
ah yes you got to see the infamous pounding
so far it's my favorite zelda game
but you really need to play link between worlds at some point
yeah that's a little unfortunate that i wont get the original experience but i feel like i can kind of intuit what it was like
i like not being frustrated
i like easy
you need to play link between worlds
i bet that will change though
but for whatever reason im looking forward to twilight a lot more
because it comes first in the timeline
i am planning to
next friday
well that will be friday
unless you make me come over before then
also i hope you realize there's a good chance i will beat either majora or twilight princess or both before the 30th
same amount of lives but more people
i dont know how it functions in dktf or rayman but in mario the camera/bubble system can often get people killed, and you share the same life pool
i think so purely because you cant go at your own pace
especially in mario 3d world because it turns out the co-op players dont always co-operate
also i feel like co-op platforming games are significantly harder in co-op
i feel like both asher and i need to be trained.
and if ronald is getting a wii u for his brother,  ronald needs to be at least as good as his brother
but for specifically things like you watching me play twilight princess should be separate
i mean the lan party can include some nintendo marathon stuff like you educating us on platformers for example
that can be separate from the lan party though i think
i also got tropical freeze for 15 bucks on amazon
mario world is 4 player too and pretty fun
also aside from overwatch i can bring smash and whatever other co-op games you want
theres a rumor btw that from software has ds3 running on the switch and are early in plans to re-release all three games + their dlcs for it
eh it's not that hard to learn
i forgot that this year we all have a game we can play together that's not aoe
actually nvm thats not an issue
the bigger issue
but i know all those people so i might
i hope you understand if i dont want to go
how large is largish
and speed run mario world
im sure he could be a high paid electrical engineer at any major softwaare/hardware company, yet he chooses to make video game videos
sethbling continuously impresses me
ok wtf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nViIUfDMJg
here's my song of the week if anyone cares https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oPRiEZAN2g
what a classic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkailb3xcTI
sorry asher i keep this chat muted when im working.
i think i can play next weekend though
😦
im sure one of them has a removeable battery
there are a bunch of tile alternatives you know
i bet we arent even his fam
what has he become
i think when ronald comes we should all go see it and you can teach us both about its meaning and lore
ah so this new movie is between 3 and 4
but why arent they continuing the force awakens arc
i dont understand why they are making another movie thats not in the same time frame as the force awakens
actually i probably know less than the average person
i wish i knew more than the average person about star wars
why do you have to reserve tickets for a movie
There's a pretty close game right now
Is anyone watching the major
what mp3 player did you get
ugh this show is so boring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHgUOnPb-30
YESSS ZELDA TOWN TRAILER
lol michael phelps will be presenting the best esports player
yeah but my point was the old ff games werent like xenoblade but now they are like xenoblade
i dont see any common people between the xenoblade and ff15 teams
this final fantasy game is notably different from the rest though
same kind of combat and party system and open world rpg fantasy style
but its the same format
it looks like literally xenoblade
i watched ign's review and basically their entire review was negative but they still gave it an 8.2
i still havent watched the first one
it feels like an rpg very much in the style of xenoblade and xenoblade chronicles
it doesnt even look like final fantasy or resemble it in any way
what is this new final fantasy game
and winston
and lucio
i also needed some sexy reinhardt
they could have at least put some pictures of her
and no reinhardt
0/10
theres also no mercy
i should also mark that as nsfw
https://zaggy.nl/Playwatch-2016-11-en.pdf
I have to get the exact number of moles
Alright as long as I handle the chemistry
WhT is % alcohol

Oh boy
oh boy stardew valley is coming to swtich
Yeah skyrim is well known for its ost but I just hadn't realized that fallout had normal music in it too.
I thought it was just all the radio
song of week
holy shit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdOKjUfMPe0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5tPJDZv_VE
what the hell oracle of seasons and oracle of ages are completely different games
you should listen to crypt of the necrodance ost
bro
im hoping they show some towns or characters on thursday
ugh im so hyped now
theres plenty of stuff to do in new york
guys lets go to new york http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/28/13769892/nintendo-switch-new-york-event
gueesss what boyss https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/803376056107417601
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHhX5GtWNr8
he has a lot of stuff thats not just mario and zelda which is cool to analyze too
which is why i think it suffices that this guy goes through that formula and various iterations of it
it might get boring because a lot of them use the same basic formula
that would be a lot of work
i really like his zelda dungeon analysis too
this is so inspiring
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u6HTG8LuXQ
it really highlights why it's so incredibly difficult to make good games
he has a whole video on how nintendo makes their games and why it's different from everyone else
which one did you watch
i know im addicted
holy shit this is a such a cool youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqJ-Xo29CKyLTjn6z2XwYAw
it really bothers me
everyone in the article is either named Tom, Tim, Tod, or Thompson
goddamnit tod from bedford
am
i ma
<:curse:248225815005757442>
wow did you have a u-lock
ok
we should play dota
ok
just let me know when
does anyone want to play stuff today
uts the same
dont you already have a big speaker
i think headphones are always better
there are these traveling musicians in the milk bar who play these songs for 10 rupees
the milk bar soundtrack from link between worlds is so good https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSrVa7QN64g&index=13&list=PLJtLAyYfDCShbw4IGLdk_MpZT5F7WfbZT
because their effects only apply in battle
yeah the only use of hyper training is to max the IVs of legendaries you cant breed
of course
as rare as master balls at the lotto
and it costs bottle caps to do which are really rare
meaning it doesnt work for breeding and the true IVs remain the same
its only fake
so hyper training (maxing IVs at lv 100) isnt as broken as i thought
like all the tapus are on one page
they arent always evo slots
maybe they are buddies
mybe for miltank?
im ready
cool
<@!125452744440938497> <@!127535721857679362> dota?
also theres a whole new side-minigame of pokemon now thats basically one of those mobile RTS's that use real time
i love how bottle caps are now a currency in pokemon
i do now
does nayone want to play game tonight
it ends up having a lot of complexity which is especially impressive considering it was made by just one guy
i hope it wins indie game of the year
most games aside from pokemon i get bored with after a while
it's one of the few games i spent weeks playing right after i got it during the summer
its on steam sale right now
stardew valley
omg ben that game is awesome
you can swap smt for platinum and asher can play pokemon too
that doesnt make sense
why
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNzfdv5wIMg
i realized im going to have to beat mario sunshine before the new mario comes out as well
i really liked it because it was easier in difficulty than other zeldas i played, and it's also open world.
I didnt even get all the items or upgrades and could still beat it
asher did you want to borrow it still?
alright i can check off albw
keenan there's a guy in a link between worlds that dresses up as a bee and constantly asks you to catch bees for him
you cant watch a movie without playing the game first
before this movie comes out
guys we need to marathon the lego batman series
Never die on boss battles
Although the whole game is fairly easy for a Zelda title
The dungeons are nice and short
I forgot how amazing this game is
Almost done
Guys I did three a link between worlds dungeons today
https://imgur.com/Lz2oyPM.jpg
dont you still have to do side quests and stuff
that doesnt seem like much
dont you only have like 60 hours in it
Zelda is literally fallout but more about puzzles and exploration
It's pretty amazing that between the Wii u and the 3ds you can legally play every single Zelda game
I mean they just put a bunch of original wii games on the eShop for Wii u
And it's not that hard to just put old games on the eshop
There's a good chance a lot of games will.get ported because the Wii u had a lot of good titles that not many people got to play
There's some rumor that Xenoblade Chronicles X will get a port
Which ones?
I'm sure they'll get ports
You would probably really like fire emblem ronald
But a Wii doesn't fit in your pocket
And a shit ton of jrpgs
Ronald there's also smash and mario kart on the 3ds
A link between worlds is like the best 3ds game besides pokemon
3ds also gets a lot of indie titles
Phones aren't really designed for long term gaming
And a battery life actually meant for playing games
And the 3ds has buttons
Also there are no good mobile games
Yeah the pokemon models are extremely high in polygon count
No because it's too intensive graphically to handle the double resolution of the 3d
The latest pokemon game doesn't even support 3d
You don't have to use that
There's so much you can play on it
You should
I kind of want to go buy that $99 3ds for my brother
rip
And it had a cute Asian chick in it not a boy
They got it on Amazon
What if you get trampled
That's basically the same
Do you really want to go to walmart on black Friday
Ok wtf
How is there dota right now
It probably will again
Well I've seen it go on sale for 400 a couple times
Well i got it right when it came out
It retailed at 500 when it came out.
480 isn't even really a deal
It has before
It will
You asked if it was good though
I don't trust any electronic under 20 that only has 4 reviews
Do ps4 games still cost 60 dollars or do they go down or on sale if they are older
Of too many jrpgs
Money aside, I feel like it also just adds to your problem
No time
Like a collection of the best mega man games is on sale on the eShop for 8 dollars and I really want to get it
Although I did just beat a 50 hour jrpg in 6 days but maybe that's because I'm a little too obsessed
That's how I feel about this Zelda series I need to complete
Lol
Why
There are way too many games i want to play and I cant stop myself from buying them even though i can't play them
Wouldn't you like fallout 4 though
Lol
But there's no way i have time to play all those
I want to get fire emblem, links awakening, dream team, mega man series, and twilight princess
Ugh there are so many good eShop sales right now http://happyholidays.nintendo.com/cyber-deals
What is that
keenan there's an ultrabeast called Guzzlord and it's amazing
dont have y mouse and id prefer not to
im athome and have my coputer
😎
are you going to come play <@!127535721857679362>
<@!127535721857679362> 😎
you should really paly it sometime
best pokemon
i think this pokemon is officiall the best rpg ive ever played
yes
more hype http://nintendoeverything.com/bethesdas-todd-howard-on-switch-one-of-the-best-demos-ive-ever-seen-promises-support/
<@!127535721857679362>
That new turtoginator dude is exclusive to sun though
I just want an all turtle team
omg i forgot about this guy
Yeah but we can't start until asher is ready
Ok
Anyone want to play stuff
Yeah
This game is really funny
Since ti
full team on the couch
lol this eg cast
i 3d print more than i 2d print
if only i printed things ever
huh
for what
i wish i was a kid again and really into legos so i could experience lego star wars for the first time
they have good co-op too
really any of the lego games are good
which may make it worth it
lego city undercover is a nintendo select though
it was an open world police lego game
forgot exactly what it was called
i heard lego city was really good
you have to get mario kart and smash if he's playing with friends
and so is yoshi
mario kart is awesome for kids
no are you serious
i dont know how old he is
zelda might be too hard for your brother idk
kirby
200 and mario kart 8, yoshi wolly world, 3d world, the zelda remakes, pikmin 3, mario maker
that or i order from the appetizers
honestly though if a resturaunt has the same thing on both menus i would rather just order from the kids because it's smaller portions and i cant eat that much
i forgot what i got at applebees
i thought i only did that at buccettos
it doesnt matter who talked i would be laughing the whole time
i would wear my pikachu there but i dont think i could hold it together when ordering
is applebees even open 24/7
cant
we can be weird at applebees
yeah but that would be weird
and philip
only you
i cant
oh sorry i keep forgeting you are occasionally on discord too
bonsly
it's a lot easier to get him on later islands
how does it feel that you just comitted mass genocide against pichus
umbreon
you know who a coold boy

you dont need it
that patch

yes
under a tree
the first patch on the right
when you enter the route from the southside
yeah
yeah route 3
and/or bagon
keenan have you caught the salamance
never used one before in all my years
pikachu is new and original for me
catastropika is beautiful
the pikachu costume inspired me to use pikachu and i love him so much
are you mainly just missing evos
hmm i thought it would be more
whats your melemele %
i used to think it made it harder to catch pokemon but i actually liek the added challenge now
i really love the summoning mechanic
keenan how was the kahuna battle
dota w/ asher, overwatch w/ the rest of you
the place with the rock fairies
oh i know where you are
is that on the second island?
i'll be around tomororow
where are you in pokemon
okay
we need to play games tonight
Speaking of which, the topography and maps in this game are by far the best
Interstates
It reminds me of interststes
The path by the daycare is so long, you can just look at the map and see the huge dent it makes in the terrain to see where it is
They're so kind
I love how game freak always puts a long straight path by the daycare


we need 15 games in Hots to get genji skin
yes
i'll wait now
still takes 15 minutes to complete
for people that know what mobas are
good news is that you can choose veteran mode
"well done!
choose a free hero as a gift!" oh god
these ones are big men though
therse a tutorial
bad news guys
Oh my god Keenan stoutland is the best
we also need to play dota
im going to download it
Then the 6p is one of the best.
Or the one plus 3
Better than s7
It's still a good phone though
<:ronald:230126993008623616>
We've always been twitch chat
Rip my beautiful sense of style
Aw yeah diglett use that metal claw
good Job professor
THEN HOW COME ITS ALL BATS AND RATS
I NEED DIGLETT
It still probably has good stats
I heard at 40 a shiny is 1/200
Ugh i hate when I have to give in and use great balls
Is diglett in the cemetery

I've been trying to catch an oricorio for like 10 minutes because he keeps calling allies
This makes normal catching so much harder
Oh shit "Not all reinforcements are friendly.
Be prepared to protect your naïve target from predators if they appear."
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/5d55id/a_guide_to_chaining_for_pokemon_in_sunmoon/
Idk
It's so depressing when help doesn't appear
i think dugtrio might have to be my steel type
honestly
so much for tjat
i killed it
oops
but once you get 10 you can scan the whole island for a rare mon
they add the pokemon you scanned as "seen" in the pokedex and it allows you to find that pokemon on the map
scan some codes buddy
so i scanned 10 qr codes and now i have an hour to find a chikorita on rout 2
🙂 the pokemon center just celebrated my birthday
Lets get Figy with it!
Watch while I nanab me some Berries!
that berry scene is amazing
this shittiest think about having terrible speed on rowlet and his evos is that i can never escape from wild pokemon
i already have my main dudes planned out
because the 5 other mons on my team are worthy of my real team
i only use my starter
ugh all the pokemon i want are on the last two islands
i really love astonsih
and astonish
there used to be unique jingles for each kind of trainer
but you know what im talking about right
which is maybe why they got rid of the various ones
and the new theme complements it really well
but i do like the encounter animation so fucking much
im not sure if i like it
and replaced them all with just that one
also have you noticed that they got rid of the different encounter themes for different kinds of trainers
lv10 salamance
but keenan
hm
its actually on route 3
and once you do, there's a really rare chance you can get him to summon a level 10 salamance for help
there's a place on melemele island where there's a really rare chance to find a bagon
holy shit
i could get alolan sandslash
this boy cant even learn bullet punch
pretty useful
good against ice rock and fairy
i need a real steel type
whats the point of this steel type
bull shit
shit wtf this guy only learns one steel type move and that's gyro ball

for some reason i really like the concept of a steel electric pokemon that doesnt look like a machine
yeah i really want him on my team but i think my steel type is going to be the steel/electric pikachu clone
salandit will be my fire type
she's ice and fairy
but nope
i was thinking "ninetails is going to be my fire type this gen"
also i just realized today that ninetails isnt fire type
because i think some trainer told me that
i dont know why but i have a feeling that cutiefly is rare
but i think i have some other rare mons
no
i saw a trainer that had one
like in the wild?
the old man just gives you a drink and talks you about deep aspects of life
I cant figure out the purpose
btw have you figured out the point of the cafes yet?
pokemon games always have on point dialogue
"aww it's so cute...
oh...
OH. *OH It abducts children?!?*?
that woman is a perfect representation of how i feel the average person would perceive pokemon
i cant belive i got 10,000 pokebucks for that shit
i did
and repeat that process
you kill the original, and then make the summoned ally call for help
i think all pokemon can summon allies?
I'm not sure.
there are certain conditions that will increase the chances if the wild pokemon calling for help
is this the show with the french fries
and each subsequent ally they call has an increased chance to be shiny
you chain by making wild pokemon repeadedly call allies for help
thats no fun
ok one of my goals is to make a smeargle perfect for chaining shinies
ah
and then after that how do you get another move if it only has 1 pp
but how do you sketch a move
i need to figure out how to use sketch to get a smeargle with a full custom move set
i thought he was small
why the hell is he so big
like smeargle is fucking huge
yeah i saw that
was it alola
i saw a gastly in the cemetary
and bam you have pokemon stars
it's so easy for them to just take sun and moon, bump up the res, maybe add a bit more extra content, and slap on some windwaker shaders like they did for windwaker hd
and it will be fucking beautiful
they will probably add shaders link windwaker
yeah it will just be all the same high polygoon models but with no jagged lines
i forgive pokemon on the 3ds because a) the models have extremely high polygons and b) the cell shading and overworld looks pretty decent
and did it bad
yeah there were a lot of gba games that tried to do 3d
3ds has low res which looks bad when you try to do 3d models
the sp had low res but it didnt matter because games werent 3d for the most part so they still hold up and look good
mainly the resolution
it has it's flaws
idk i really like my 3ds
lol
and when you consider that the GBA is just a handheld snes it makes the gba amazing too
somewhat
i agree
snes is just moore's law at work
and dont forget real controllers
gc is just n64 with better graphics and more experienced 3d devs
by the time gamecube came
yes because they figured out how to do camera
snes was the perfect improvement on the nes, the gamecube was the perfect improvement on the n64, and the wii u was the perfect improvement on the wii although they just marketed it poorly
but my point of the snes being superior still stands
i accept that
i dont want to write down codes
which had stupid fucking codes
and then there's metroid
eh
but it's a shitty and frustrating way to increase difficulty
it's an increase in difficulty because the carts couldnt hold much data to make the games longer
yeah i understand why you cant save
it cant have too many annoyances
like i said if i get frustrated by a game i just dont play it
yeah most frustrating part
even though the classic fixed some of the problems by allowing you to save anywhere
for me the nes doesnt meet that requirement
i think snes is the perfect retro console in that all of its games still hold up perfectly today
which will be far superior
im just going to wait for the snes classic edition
within 30 seconds
but they also sold out on amazon
yeah i think nintend severely underestimated how popular that would be
lol
that was also absurdly popular
did you guys sell tthe nes classic edition
these are the most pre-ordered games in nintendo history
probably should have bought more
because those guys look awesome too
i cant wait until we see the true evil of the aether foundation
he's just the wimp who stands in the back while grunt b does all the fighting
grunt a is my favorite character
today is just my age birthday
my true birthday was yesterday
if the switch relly gets 3d mario platformer, mario rpg, mario kart, zelda, pokemon, splatoon, skyrim, all within the first 6-8 months of its launch there's no doubt it will sell well
when we get to see trailers
for januarary
im hype
but i know about them
zero
also i think the rabbids characters fit right into the mario universe
rayman who uses rabbids as a final smash
but oh well
he should have been in the last one
yeah
like ZombiU launched with the wii U and I never played it but I heard it was the best launch title
like they always have good games at launch for nintendo
ubisoft has historically been one of the better third parties on nintendo consoles
i hope it's like the rest of them
and also i love the turn based mario rpgs
it's definitely smarter to brand it that way
mario is a way bigger brand than rabbits
I like this statement "Nintendo intends to pitch the project to consumers as a Mario RPG project in collaboration with Ubisoft, in spite of Ubisoft doing most of the work on development."
theres also this: http://letsplayvideogames.com/2016/11/report-ubisoft-developing-rabbids-mario-crossover-rpg-for-switch-launch-day/
because black and white 2 came out on the DS when the 3ds was already almost a year old
i mean theres a new pokemon game roughly every year so thats not surprising but it being on the switch instead of 3ds is kind of surprising
<@155893986605793281>   http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-11-18-nintendo-switch-will-get-pokemon-sun-and-moon-version
This kid is straight up dangerous, homie
Omg Grunt A and Grunt B call each other by their letter names
Or everyone
Or asher
Keenan
Do you want to call
I get out at 12:05
Keenan i never knew I wanted a personal rotom assistant in pokemon
because it's had the longest development time and will be really big
everyone is saying the next dota patch will be 7.00
at ballantine
in class
Lilly needs to learn how to use pokeballs
Holy shit Keenan that pokemon was literally a superhero!
Did you see these family photos of the teams
How is slacks such a perfect man
Yeah
Mom and professor kukui are totally going to bang
Absolutely revolutionary
Holy shit my mom has a bed now
Of instead of moving to alola you were shipwrecked there
You know what would have been cool
Half of this games space must be cut scene data
Did not realize cut scenes could be this good
Holy shit this music
literally racism
ok but gen 1 getting the only new forms is a pretty big deal
although you do get johto starters in oras
still they are doing too much for gen 1
i guess..........................
gen 2 and 4 and 5 dont even have mega evos
they dont get alolan forms
like what about every other gen
both in this and x and y
yeah i actually dont like how they keep trying to do so much gen 1 catering
need to cater to the genwunners
?
i think this is all very good considering this game is more open and focused on exploration
im already suuper popular keenan
all the nerds in my math class are also into video games
i'll be there around 3:55
i dont care
because every pokemon game is perfect
inccorect
is this the first perfect pokemon game
what do you mean a live map
wht
you even made a comic about him
he needs to be on your team too
oh shit me too
lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4VhE0W9Bms
pilotwings
you know what has a really good soundstrack
you need to clean your screen
oh theres no doubt you'll like it
and all previous pokemon games have had that
also in pokemon, the characters and story that people get attached to aren't the humans it's the pokemon and their lore
i mean truly every game just boils down to a worse version of pokemon
not after playing any other pokemon game
which is why i said after playing moon
i know
i get the impression it's just a worse version of pokemon but with devils and shit
keenan do you really think you will be able to play smt apocalypse after this
yeah i heard it has amazing character development
he's not going to care on the same level that we do though until he gets the game himself
i love how we're the only ones in this chat who care about this game
arent you still petting popplio
im going to try
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYN_6Y4o9rU
https://youtu.be/JvmM6ihpnbw
http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2016/11/15/yup-people-donating-planned-parenthood-mike-pences-name/93877642/ lol
http://www.system3.com/constructor-returns-in-high-definition/ this game looks awesome
February dead month
ready
you should update if you havent already
yeah give me one sec
BTS must spend all their time making videos instead of casting
what the hell https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsX9NrEbtmk
im looking at these nominations and i think overwatch definitely wins every category its nominated in http://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-2016-game-awards-nominees/1100-6445481/
and into the ways of the devil
that
keenan maybe you can convert cosplay girl
yeah i can in a bit
yeah ben if you go to pinned, you can jump to the messages in history
i mean analyze the chat
yeah i can do that
or sooner
because amazon essentially has to get the item in like 3 days before it actually releases
im afraid it wouldnt work
does it work
im talking about for other thigns
this changes everything
amazon  does release-day delivery
shit
yeah
the main story takes like 100 hours
thats impossible
*but how does it feel*
keenan how does it feel that your favorite game, majora, has less sales than zelda II
did not expect that
twilight princess is the best selling zelda game
also what the hell
unless you add remakes/remasters together
no zelda game has sold over 10 million copies
you're always right
nintendo you got me agaian
i think i was wrong.... 😦
it's definitely a lot smarter to release the switch with a new mario than a new zelda
even fucking ocarina of time only sold 7.6m compared to sm64 which was 11m
Link to the past only sold 4.6 mil and super mario world sold 20.6 million
zelda is definitely for a niche market
also i just realized how low zelda games sell compared to other nintendo franchises
keenan where is my pokemon
i could be on the wario ware team
wow that art is incredible
<:god:230133457630658562>
sad times
remember when pokemon didnt come today
good thing you took those precautions keenan
damnit he actually read it
SONG OF THE WEEK https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg6CiPI6h2g
miyamoto practically has the same birthday as me
and the ability to create more advanced adn diverse environemnts and soundtracks
just because of the technical capability
like i think a game like dktf is probably a lot more polished and diverse than a game like dkc2
if something frustrates me enough i'll just give up
i dont tolerate things like that
or gameplay elements
or there are major annoyances with controls
i just dont like how a lot of older games are limited on the technical side
dont know about dk
in general
but i always think newer games are better than older ones
i havent really played any of them
partially because david wise did the soundtrack for tropical freeze but not for dkc returns
like way better than dkc returns
im reading reviews of tropical freeze and didnt realize it was one of the best dk games
when i can focus better
i'll think about this after pokemon
it would just be that book
i feel like i dont own enough physical books for me to have a cool collection that the tetris book can be added to
but i guess i could get kindle edition and just read it on my computer
i'l have to preview it on kindle because sometimes comic books dont turn out well
yeah
but i would read it in like 2 hours
yeah
but its a story told with 250 of comic
yeah i thought it was a story but told with250 pages of text
i thought it was just like pictures of tetris over time or seomthing like that apple book
this is just a comic book
no i really didnt understand
oh i see
i wanted a narrative
wtf is a graphic novel
oh wait it is a graphic novel
i dont think tetris book is pictures
game of thrones is also 10 bucks and like 900 pages
its only 10 dollars on kindle i might get it
you showed us but i forgot about it because it wasnt out yet at the time
shit i want that tetris book
does this work just like that wishlist app
lol
and now im dissapointed that they aren't
holy shit someone just walked by at the exact beat to my music and i thought their heels clicking on the floor were part of the song
IM TRYing TO WORK AND SOME CONSTRuction DudE IS JACKHAMMERING OR SOMETHING IN THE HALLWAY NEXTDOOR
ASDFASDJFADFJQWEWLIFFJASDLFKJASDF
he's really just meditating for 4 hours once every 3 days or so
it's not even that weird
and another 1000 in pokemon
which isn't too bad considering i have like 2000 in dota
he's approaching 1000 hours of sitting and smiling
i thought that was 2013
ok buddy
http://www.sittingandsmiling.com/
About 2.5 hours into the webcast, I hear someone come into the
house, which is odd, because my only housemate is at work, and we 
aren't expecting anyone.
I realize I didn't check to see if the doors 
were locked before starting the webcast.
I hear the person stealthily moving 
around the house, and then I hear them stealthily climbing the stairs, 
towards my room.
My door opens, and I hear an unfamiliar male
voice say "Hello?".
Then, after presumably seeing me sitting still and 
smiling in front of a camera, lit from beneath by a florescent bulb, he 
promptly descends the stairs and exits the house.

<:curse:248225815005757442>
true
no because you dont know if you are making a check for $230.00 or $23000
how can you buy from someone who doesnt use punctuation
Call or trxt mad max killzone shadow fall call of duty advance warrior day zero edition $230 cash firm
wow this guy really knows how to market...

idk you're the one who knows him on facebook
can we get ricky as an emote
it's finally happening
it was the curse
keenan it was ricky
Where's the fun in that
Noooooooooooooooo
Nooooooooo
A lot of obscure stuff like VGM music is only on YouTube
Between Google music and YouTube every song is available
Like which ones
There were features it didn't have but I forgot why
I tried Spotify and switched to Google music because Spotify bothered me a lot
Has offline capability too
Which is just like spotify
Keenan YouTube red comes with Google music
you geta lot of free months if you buy anything from google
no one cares about the youtube red exclusive content
i use it all the time because it gets rid of ads, it lets you download any video, lets you play with screen off, and gives you google play music subscription
samsung just doesnt optimize their stuff
but its still slower
im pretty sure the s7 might have more ram than the pixel
doesn't mean it uninstalls all the shitty ffeatures
you can make any phone look like a regular android phone
but it isnt
they add all these features that slow down the device that no one ever uses
i hate samsung's software so much
and also thats because the s7 is a lot older
thye might for cyber monday
but you can also buy it from the google store which is unlocked
yeah for their store
and the OS being unlocked
it's still completely different from apple for one reason, the software
you can also buy it from the play store
yeah if you buy it from verizon
the pixel works on every carrier
cant you just buy it unlocked and put your sim in
i thought you had cricket
a galaxy phone will never be as fast
oh no doubt the pixel
the problem with apple's book is that you can just see all those pictures on their product pages
i cant watch it now since im in class
is that really what the video says
an absolute classic
that thumbnail is perfect
holy shit there's actually a video about it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkskY9bL9Bk
it's 300 for the top model
except the folks on /r/apple think it's to cheap
this whole thing seems like a massive joke
this is the most revolutionary product they've ever created
"The book is available in two sizes: small, starting at $199, and large starting at $299"
lol http://www.wired.co.uk/gallery/apple-book-photos-cost
there's plenty of jellyfish pokemon
you'll be back is my second favorite
i think this is my favorite song from it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXGBMVgHy1U
do you like it?
keenan have you listened to the hamilton soundtrack at all
im saying this just to piss you off but it is true
doesn't mean it cant have platforming elements
ever since ocarina of time really
zelda has always had its roots in platforming
maybe there's a reason why
hey some people actually liked the adventure of link
that will be enouhg
i'll laucnch it for 5 minutes then get bored
by then botw will surely be out
order is this: ocarina, twilight, majora, a link between worlds, skyward sword, nes 1, nes 2, the gameboy and color line, and then maybe i'll replay the ds games if i have time since it's been a while
yeah i will
the greate zeldo marathon of 2016-2017
i got to change this
the marathon starts now
im so pissed
sadrgdsderweyt5uyjthygjhut6rye5tfugiho
i forget
maybe i beat it
ive played like half of it too
yes the gba version
yeah on wii ware
i have no excuse
like wtf is wrong with me
the shitty thing is that i own all the zelda games except twilight princess, tri force heroes, links awakening, and oracle of seasons/ages
and become a pro zelda player
im going to get really good at zelda
i know very little zelda lore
and not even four of the biggest ones besides wind waker
that's my point this guy thinks he's a bad zelda fan because he hasn't played like 4 of the games
i know im far worse
yeah and i feel like shit about being that way
like wtf
some guy on reddit posted "i call my self a zelda fan but have only played these games" and then he lists like every game except for the DS games, Minish Cap, and Windwaker
cant read that
i dont know how anime characters work
except for the kid ones
the pokemon trainers do not look 10 at all
yeah and kid link looks like a baby
doesn't even make sense
i dont understand why that's a thing
i always forget you play as a 10 year old in every game
those pesky 11-year-olds
i bet they are all just kids
big sis
i think the grunts called her bib sis
she wasnt the boss right
who was that lady in the demo
yeah which makes team rocket evil no matter how innocent the grunts look
i think a lot depends on whoever their boss leader man is
playing harmless pranks
messing around
team skull are just a bunch of innocent teens
lol i didnt realize he had a mustache
just look at these adorable guys.
how can they be evil
you are going to have to if you want oranguru
ah ok it's called Pokemon Refresh now
sorry i thought that was obvious
mario
but with mario
i think it will be more like sunshine or 64
and they are about to drop all the info at once in january
because im 90% sure nintendo has been working on a massive new mario game secretly this whole time
that's kind of what im hoping they do wiwth the new mario
the only way you can prevent me from learning about games before they release is not to release any info
i kind of want to see a game completely in the dark
yeah but im always going to follow news about the game if they release
until literally the day before
like imagine if we werent even aware of new pokemon games
like the opposite of what they did for sun and moon
i kind of wish nintendo just announced games one day before release.
ITS IN THREE DAYS
OH BOY BEN
some reviewer mentioned it
i forgot what it's called now
also apparently poke amee is renamed and you can have the option to open it it immediately after battles to restore the morale of your pokemon and heal status conditions
They are real people!
for your collection
so they are no longer just trophies
and there's real incentive to
with poke pelago
your can interact with pokemon not in your party now
dont forget
but wait keenan
i thought your team was just orangatu
feebas
feel as?
might as well look at the others now because they arent your starter
aw
keenan did you see the other starter z-moves yet or just primarina
mega torterra would just be earth
mega torterra
nah man
they cant just drop them like that
that was such a hype feature of xy and oras
although im kind of disappointed they didnt add new mega evolutions
since yoou can only use them once and they can easily be messed up with protect or a switch out
it seems like z-moves are a lot more balanced than mega evolutions
fuck no
fight evil?
because honestly when you give a 10 year old the most powerful pokemon in the world what do you expect them to do
went back to route 1 and blasted zigzagoons
thats what i did in oras as soon as i got mega rayquaza with dragon pulse
my hobby in this game is going to be wrecking noob pokemon with z moves
so i would have to set up some sort of spell checker and docx formatter within vim
there's no plugin for word
ok no joke i actually want to figure out a way to write my essays in vim
i try to download the client version of everythin
i hate that too oddly enough
90% of the time i dont need all the features word has
only did it when i absolutely needed it to edit a word file
i went 8 months on my desktop without installing office
very convenient
well thats really lightweight
lol
i like how it's more lightweight
also collab
because i dont need anything more complicated than for most purposes
i use the client too but i edit in google docs most of the time
drive should really be my most used
same with google drive
which is weird
but it doesn't count gmail because it's always open and i never really open it naturally
like it should be gmail canvas reddit
it's just pinned
the only reason gmail.com isn't my most used as well is because i have it open constantly
i use inbox on my phone with iu though
ah ok
you should be able to check iu email just by going to nromal gmail
that means you havent set it up properly
lol umail
this is a big moment

so canvas has finally surpassed reddit
well they aren't wrong
i dont even play genji
Why
oh yeah i guess
same thing in oras for the post game
i forget which
or in emerald at least
in ruby and sapphire magma and aqua turn out to be kind of good
about the scientist people
i bet it's exactly what we predicted
people are saying it has a really good story
"Poké Pelago, the side quests, the absolutely stunning nature of the presentation, it's all a sheer joy from start to finish.
Game Freak hasn't missed a beat and has managed to carefully balance the inclusion of new mechanics without totally ruining things for the most hardcore fans.
It's got content coming out of its ears, a much more interesting story, and rewards exploration in a way no other title in the series has.
Whether you're a Pokémon fan new or old, this is an absolutely essential purchase."
"Simply put, Sun and Moon are best Pokémon games that Game Freak has ever produced. "
another quote: "I think Pokemon Sun & Moon is a bit brilliant.
It’s not quite perfect, but it’s best Pokemon release in years."
another review quote of sumo: "The end result is not just the best Pokémon game ever, but one of the best video games ever made."
uggggggh
ugh
so relieving
i just now realized how glad i am hm's  no longer exist
need to do twilight over break
actually screww that
because thats teh order they come in the timeline
no ithink  i need to do ocarina -> majora -> twilight
no i will finish ocarina over thanksgiving break
you still have a bit of time until i finish ocarina
lol
are you going to lend it to me or not
eh
i just dont have time for both
i understant
?
probably not right
are you still going to lend me the 3ds version
im sure i'll still be spooked
the enhanced technical capabilites can be used to create surrealist environments just as well
and amazed by the game
im sure i'll still be uneasy
and play in a dark room with all the lights off by myself
easy
i can just turn the brightness down all the way
all thats different is the n64 is darker
NO
that way they are timeless
i only like old games if they are pixel graphics or wind-waker style
i hate old 3d games
no
no
fine but i still want to do portable version because it's better
botw only has 4 dungeons and thats not going to be a short game
i cant do that with any game
aaaaaaaaaaas
i cant fill that time with majora when i can play majora any other time
thats my only opportunity for them
twilight princess and skyward sword are games i will only be able to play during this break and winter break
and the only reason i have time at all is that it's portable
i dont have time for both
you can show me those parts after i play it on ds
it's an experience i dont care to have
nah
no
ew
no
YES
how can you watch that
but i'll play majora on ds
but i want to play it on my own time
alright
thats a lot
thats like five four-hour sessions
thats at least 20 hours
well i'll probably be getting twilight princess on wii u
after i beat sumo thats my primary goal
im actually going to play all the major zelda games before botw now
i want to play overwatch with you when you have high graphics so you can see mercy for real
btw when are you getting sams computer
we'll see how it does in the gamma
because ive only really heard of it since today and yesterday
tell me how it is
which is why i asked
yeah
btw how do you feel about this new game http://store.steampowered.com/app/493340/
thats not a real publisher
no but the last of us soundtrack was pretty good
i would probably like their games though
yeah i only spend 60 dollars on games by publishers that start with n
is it good
is that the bethesday game
in case you needed some more hype
nintendolife said it was the best pokemon game gamefreak has ever created
reviewers already have review copies
oh ok
dont you have class with me until 5:15
ok just let me know
tomorrow?
"oops"
what if i accidentally finish the game before it releases
fuck if it comes in tomorrow then im even more screwed
i need to know if i should try to get all my work done for friday before thursday
did you improve your plan at all
yeah i think so still because it has metagross
so i guess if i mainly play from 6-11 it will be day
because pokemon night starts at like 6pm
or maybe night idk
i think the majority of my time playing will be during the day
it's so weird though
i dont know how i feel about that
so it will be night during the day and day during the night
also keenan i remembered that pokemon moon takes place 12 hours later than sun
lol
and tell him that mac wants botw *right now*
you should go say hi miyamoto
that would be cool
so you could buy it there if so
i think the switch might be region free
that way i can be at the nintendo store which is basically japan
i might try to be in new york during spring break
in japan?
why
how
wow
no but im guessing spring break
march
yeah stupid valve spends all their time patching their old games instead of making new ones
why should nintendo
i mean bethesda doesnt seem to care
help the speedrunners out a little bit
they should just not do testing
apparently they still have to do a lot of testing
you can release it sooner and fix it with patches
fuck his famous quote
http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-11-15-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-will-miss-nintendo-switch-launch
due to an immense amount of dialogue and voice acting
there are some rumors going around that localization is taking longer than they thought
oh yeah
and that hurts sales of both?
or vice versa
you are saying that people with 60 bucks are going to rather invest that in botw then the switch
because you can say the same thing about mario
so then it should have no launch titles?
thats all that matters
people wont buy a system without games
no it should be the primary incentive
they are also heavily invested in the switch doing well
their entire show
it was literally all they showed at e3
why wouldn't they
😦 i'll probably have to play some shitty mario game instead
botw is looking more and more like it wont be a launch title
im so sad
i think  he shut it down himself
tfw you need a professional portrait of yourself so you crop your family's christmas photo
since ronald deleted his message, if you scroll through history it just looks like ben and I sent the same picture of ronald spontaneously at the exact same time
tfw you need to send something to yourself but your email isn't working

like what even is the point at this point
but can you believe nintendo is still releasing info
decidueye is literally raining justice from above
these new ultrabeasts are amaze
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xguGMeEWhhs
Stuff
What is this studd
did you listen to that jazz playlist
also how do you feel that you can max out the ivs of a pokemon with an item as long as they are level 100
because personally im glad they took away super training and went back to the old method and just buffed it
how do you feel
so in sumo did you see they took away super training and the pss
it's cool because mudkip is a water type
how did you color
what is that map of
lol
are you drawing at work
i dont know how that would be possible in real life
his hair is so well groomed exceptfor that one
although he wouldnt be nearly as cool without color
i thought you didnt usually color things
thats one cool boy
actually all of this guys videos are so good, very soothing
you should really listen to this, it will help https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG5z-46tZguJBt0wl6fvX4r_63w2BsQE6
i try to find humor in it
well the same thing happened to me keenan
but seriously why are they like dolphins
oh so maybe they arents really normal
i guess axolotls are normal pets
thats cool i didnt realize vets knew about animals other than normal pets
how come they are never dolphlins when i am there
never saw him again
i used to have a turtle who escaped his tank
also im really curious how your axolotl can jump out of the tank
im in a car
keenan at some point we need to discuss this new pokemon meta
lol
Fuck
He's not Keenan
Then upvote it
Suggest it on their forums, they implement most things on there
"read by 30 people" and then you click for exact names
What if your server had 50 people
That's kind of hard for large groups isn't it
The switch better have full on RGB lighting or I'm not buying it
I hope they do
Do any of them glow
Most of the other game consoles are ugly
Like the Xbox one S was super nice looking
All of Microsofts products looks so beautiful
I could have tried the HTC vive too but didn't want to look stupid in public
Really high res
Would be really good for media consumption
But the surface studio has such a big screen
The top pops off and then it's just an amazing 13" tablet that's actually pretty light
I also tried the surface book which I personally liked better
Which you can already try those at best buy probably
It's just like the ones on the surface pro or the surface book
Yeah?
It didn't feel weird or anything.
It's very precise and sensitive to pressure
Well it's way better than the pen on the iPad pro which is also tried at an apple store
So Keenan the Studio has a magical hinge, an amazing screen (very pretty), and the dial is like the perfect kind of clicky
So Keenan the Studio has a magical hinge, an amazing screen (very pretty), and the dial is like the perfect kind of clicky
and then it changed from the weird kind of weird to the good kind of weirdr
i thought it was weird until keenan told me it was supposed to be weird
yeah
idk the soundtrack is pretty amazing it cant possibly suck

heh
then where is that image from
oh
just get it
what about if we see how long you can go without hearing about the next pokemon games
lol
and thats why you lost
if you were realling trying to win the competition you would ahve completely isolated yourself
i think it being spoiled for you is still your fault
eh
oh i thought you were talking about last night
you did not get it spoiled
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcZTTB10_Vo
it would be too sad
i didnt want to see what class was like today
he told us to vote and register to vote several times
my professor is a huge election nerd and he seems like the type of guy to run all these prediction models and have all these theories
i didnt go to my probability class today
oh god
im not in an emotional place to learn
thats fair
scratch that: https://youtu.be/3hBbJOUgcSI
song of the week https://youtu.be/8sSo260NvJ0

i mean not good day
good day
well i'll talk to you guys tomorrow when the world has ended
how does that work
that was fast
before i do something really stupid
no i need to go to bed
i've heard it's pretty good actually
idk roger brews cider
Also considering skipping all classes tomorrow
Im considering breaking out the liquor
i just said it was nice knowing you
i didnt say anything
no the election
Well guys it was nice knowing you.
5million youtube views
because there's a completely new battle theme at the end that is one of the most viewed pokemon themes
also keenan you really need to do the postgame of ORAS
keenan we could fight red in pokemon DPPt right?

because america doesnt have a version
the UK version
ah yes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL6QuYi3rpo
i need to find that really hype japanese one
what do you think?
they are pretty crappy
can we talk about how crappy the english sun and moon trailers are
it will be the only thing i listen to
this new red theme will literally hold me over until the games release
Or maybe just a job at gamefreak
You should become a ups driver so you can get stuff one step earlier in the process
If they don't I'm going to target
Sounds like a plan
Are you going to be closing on Thursday and opening on Friday?
Because otherwise i don't think that would work
I could come too if I get my homework done
You could also midnight release for yourself
Lol
?
12:10
So 12
Keenan when can you drop off the game on Friday
Yiup
Don't forget you are buying moon for me too
oh boy oh boy
oh boy flygon can learn dragon dance now
because UB01 is much cooler
although i dont know if they refer to that in the games or if it's referred to as UB01
apparently UB01's real name is Nihilego
like that's crazy
the jellyfish  ub-01  is rock/poison
keenan the ultra beasts are so cool
we got to figure out why hair makes him steel type
i didnt realize the power of blonde hair
alolan dugrtrio is ground/steel
he just wanted a cool move
poor darkrai
50% accuracy
lol they nerfed dark void spamming smeargle
no if it negated them you could play mind games
oh i didnt know that
oh ok protect still blocks some of the damage
why would it suck
what the hell z-moves bypass protect what is this shit
they really buffed bug by giving leech life 80 damage and making it a tm
it was mega gengar that needed nerfs
but i feel like he was pretty balanced in OU
<:sadboy:230133848740986891>
he lost levitate
except for the red theme because i couldnt help it
im trying to avoid all pokemon, story, and music spoilers
i think there were new pokemon discovered in the leaks but i dont want to look at those
then you wont care when i tell you the gengar news
this information is critical for planning your future competitive teams
it's jsut a matter of looking it up now or looking it up on bulbapedia later
keenan if you think about it, these stat and ability based spoilers are not going to be something every officially announced by nintendo
yes
keenan that video is just a meme video
why are you betraying me
no as in you havent watched it or woont watch it
i need you to watch it so we can have deep discussions on the upcoming pokemon meta
keenan did you see that video
ok thats moon
also are you getting sun or moon?
that isnt a real spoiler
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWMxsj48jSU
and it's fuckkkkkkign awesome
and i found red's new theme
keenan i couldn't help myself and looked breifly at the leaks
thanksgiving break and spring break are once again perfectly aligned with big nintendo releases
i just need an hour of warmup
i already am
sorry but i'll be way better
and then i realized i should be good at a game that i was that hyped about
i just watched the original smash 4 announcement trailer and basically cried
when i finish my paper
starting today
i am going to get really good at smash
keenan i dont know why you aren't getting incineroar because he's literally based off professional wrestling
k
everyone's pissed that their favorite archer owl is slow as fuck
People are talking about that more than the actual story spoilers
One of the major leaks/spoilers from yesterday was that decidueye only has 70 base speed and everyone is complaining about it which i find hilarious
Too bad Ronald never reads discord.
He's missing out on some great app ideas
like it would be a chrome plugin that puts an "add to wishlist" button next to every item on online shopping sites
but i could make it soooo omuch better
thats basically what that site is used for
could definitely make a way better version
already exists http://www.wishlist.com/index/ but looks super shitty
app idea
its the main reason i dont
i would buy gifts for a lot more people if i could just see everyone's wishlist
which i really enjoy for some reason
just listening to the sound effects
ive had the speedrun in the background this whole time and i havent even been watching it
there is no reason for me to have three 3ds's
wont they just restock at some point
i want to buy one but i dont even know what for
do you really think they'll sell out
for what
thats disgusting wtf
im going to be pissed the rumors are true about the new mario being a launch title for the switch instead of botw
not thte sae
i wish they had a mercy amiibo
this one for sure

are you a s
because i kind of think you need a zenyatta shirt
also do you still want that zenyatta shirt
l
ol
i refuse
i'll make some for you buddy
and even if you cant there will be a ton more people making 3ds courses
you probably will at some pooint
andn get all the updates
because wii u is dead so the 3ds version will be the main version
it will
it will
which will be just as good as wii u version
also there's a 3ds version
thats your fault
if it's so famous then im sure theres a mario maker version that at least similar in style
your birthday is 28th which is like 5 days before 3ds version comes out
poor excuse
it would be slightly different but you would have the same idea
you could just create a mario maker kaizo version
its basically the same
arent these just super mario maker levels
a usb controller would be a lot cheaper and not skethy
y
sketch
looks sketchy
why is it 60 dollars
i dont understand what this is keenan
honestly people on facebook are so stupid
procedes to describe what is basically a ripoff that emulates games
"these are the real deal"
"officially" back in production
it's the one everyone is talking about on facebook
i mean look at this shitty article http://www.dailydot.com/debug/sega-genesis-preorder-details/
that come with an sd with some games and emulate them
some company is starting to produce sega genesis clones
im glad facebook has it right on election day
also <@!155893986605793281> apparently a lot of actual story spoilers were leaked for sun/moon so beware of the internet if you care
ronald get a 3ds

with a laser beam
oops accidentally one shot deoxys
is that one from the same game?
thanks i'll do that now
wtf black and white are 6 years old
its just weird to think about how long the DS's lifespan was
and just one year after that we had X and Y
isn't it insane that a DS released in 2004 could play a pokemon game released in 2012
i need to re-evaluate where i am in my work by then
-mac 5 minutes ago
"maybe"
i already answered that
I ALWAYS ANSWER QUESTIONS
what was your question
dont forget the sleath blink and aoe silence also has to be purple
?
?
?
that's also french
keenan the problem with overwatch is that it only has 1 hero where dota has 112
maybe
cool
ronald you cant just come online and not answer my question
it's probably global warming's fault
<@!127535721857679362> <@!125452744440938497> can you guys play dota later tonight at like 9:30?
ugh i cantt remember if this song is already in my list
my only problem with alcohol is that i think it all tastes bad

keenan what if they've just been secretly making the new mario this entire time and know one knew
http://nintendoeverything.com/rumor-development-on-mario-switch-nearly-done-has-more-exploration-than-3d-world-and-galaxy/
which is interesting
steven's skarmory is literally a competive skarmory
i just fought a horde battle against five mightyena and first they intimidated me 5 times in a row and then proceded to use 5 roars...
and then roar is all they did for the rest of the battle.
im pretty sure gamefreak put that shit in just to fuck with me
this is the best episode so far https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBp1quVhbjo

no he wants to drink facny stuff
etfgjhkl;./
why
game
video
huys
wake me up to play games in an hour guys
and general abilities
and i mean in terms of just lore
sombra is defrinitely the most powerful overwatch character
overwatch clearly tries to structure the meta
in dota they are but not in overwatch
bhut they just did come uup with that but didnt classify her as support
i feel like blizzard isn't creative enough to come up with any supporting character that provides utility that's not just healing
to be fair reaper's teleport is already pretty shitty and should be buffed
also more omnics
overwatch needs a more diverse support class
i just think she easily could have been a support with a slightly altered moveset/stats
her gun does not look very strong at all
as a void player
me
support riki
she's basically like riki as i see it
saetup is a way of supporting
thats definitely a support skill
except they dont classify her as support because she cant heal probably
all of her moves are supporting style
there's no way sombra should be attack
lol wtf asher
because honestly the support class is another thing dota does extremely well compared to toher games
also they need to stop making supports all healers besides symmetra
yeah usually all games balance invis extremely poorly with the exception of dota
https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/sombra/
i can click your poop to make it two poop
its definitely not
yay we can be groupme now

😮
It's unclear if he cursed Ronald or you though
I guess I was cursed
I can't get the image of the curse out of my head
Didn't realize he also told you his name
But didn't think it was enough to conclude his name was Ricky
Ok i saw that part
I'm not sure how you guys know his name is Ricky
At least we have some good stuff for your gravestone
Keenan I'm sorry if you die
I usually never laugh out loud when I'm by myself
Just read through everything...
That got intense real fast
not as the k.k.
though
keenan totaka is actually in this video
it just keeps getting weirder and weirder
whqat the fuck is this
"Here's my friend Ike.
He's got a car inside his car?
That's amaazing!"
"well it looks stella's into crafting.
that's so neat.
I hope that's organic wool stella."
this is definitely what i expect to see in a video game news video
it's really...
strange.
also keenan have you seen this https://youtu.be/5Bk3dAR0M68
idk i just think a gamer i have to experience it at least once
because its when the main lineup of games for the switch will be shown off and playable
i think this e3 in june will be really good
and TI
guys i think we also need to go to e3 at some point
hm
of nintendo merch
but is nintendo actually going to be there or just third party sellers
why will there be nintendo stuff there
im like the opposite of a wingman
but even though i know nothing about comics i can give you someone to talk to and keep you from sinning
yup
so yeah i'll follow you around anywhere
because by then i'll have an NS and nothing else will matter
i honestly havent considered my future after march
what is it again?
i can probably do that
when
thats fine too
oh i see
are you planning to go all weekend or just sunday
now i have someone to hang out with in chicago besides my mom's friends
great
it's a good musical
you said yourself
high demand
why was he in that video
did you see the one he did with obama
thats really weird
keenan do you really want to pay that much and go
ethan doesnt care about musicals
no
they were expensive
i didn't get them, my mom is really into the show and got them
actually it's matinee on sunday nov 13th
im not sure
there's nothing stopping you besides the fact that there are not seats
i said nov 12
also didnt know you were interested in musicals
no because this is a thing that my mom was doing with her friends and she invited me for my birthday
we got the tickets like months ago
there's no way there are seats left keenan
its in chicago  nov 12th
there's no such thing as off broadway rip off hamilton
that is correct
and he's like stealing the guy from you
i find it hilarious that ronald is actually taking this opportunity to fuck with someone
because
i really want to go to bed but this is going to be too good
im laughing so much
lol
....
im guessing you didn't send that?
i also love how his texts get more and more shortened
you should care because he wasted your time
there's an unbelievable amount of potential here
keenan pls
and then send him a new fact every day
keenan you should text him "Thank you for subscribing to axolotl facts."
then after like 5 he would just block your number and you would waste money
ronald this is your opportunity to fuck with people that deserve being fucked with in real life
you have to come up with something creative
it's really funny what they do to troll them back
keenan people on r/dota2 always post these chat logs from dota 2 scammers
ronald take the intro to  brain and behavior
thanks obama

"Fictional Characters make up less than 1% of all costume searches"

but honestly this is the coolest site ever

and the joker
but seriously why is harley quinn the most popular
lol google fucked up their angular template injection
this is so cool https://frightgeist.withgoogle.com/

you were probably too disturbed that you didnt notice you were disturbed
yeah
but ronald doesnt even let discord open on startup on his laptop, and therefore it is never open, and even when it is it's muted
you may not want to hear it
keenan there is something deeply disturbing i learned this weekend
is ben supposed to be replacing ronald

ive missed four classes because of this trip
yeah i just listened to it and it's exactly what i expected
because i can visually hear it
is it dreamland music
do i need sound
no keenan it isnt
Probably
Idk
Last Sunday
Yeah speaking of which don't scroll past Sunday in this chats history
But deep down all of us are screen boys
What does Ben do
Yeah see Ben only has a modest amount of screens
There are starving kids in Indiana who can't even afford 5 screens yet Ben is sitting here with only 4
I dont want to sound rude but there's actually four screens there
I couldn't tell because Google has had a Halloween thing all weekend and haven't really been paying attention
Shit it is
Oh is it Halloween
I always have to go to class
Yes
Type Null is my favorite JavaScript pokemon
:(
I sleep now
I put the server up for anyone interested
Yeah a little bit
Some dangerous shit here
Ronald and I are currently driving when we've both been awake for over 30 hours no naps or breaks
Yeah I'm the server is currently down
http://www.textin.org
www.textin.org
and i havent slept for  27 hours
guys we made a thing
9 hours left still ton to do
terrible
meanwhile liquid 👌
Keenan go to sleep
Keenan go to sleep
everyone knows valve will satisfy us with io
the jugg arcana is just a prank

look how much fun we're having

keenan show ronald your costume
drinking some weird southern soda
ya

I realized that when major news networks talk about politics they are spending the majority of the time discussing rumors or non-issues and the same 4 topics over and over again to fill time.
And that is no different at all than people on Reddit taking about the switch and nx news
i dont know why but people selling their consoles really makes me sad
😦
maybe it's just wii emulation
is it only that game?
it could be a trap
laziness
sounds sketch
i have important logistical questions
why wont ronald reply to my pms
yeah i bet they have two gameboys taped to a 3ds somewhere
yeah
it's crazy how all products are refined prototypes
yeah ive known about that since the wii u
?
so you aren't applying as a transfer student but instead as a normal freshmen?
yeah you probably cant get credit for a class and have it not appear on your transcript
why?
asher if you aren't going to iu, do your credits that you have from iu transfer?
she's probably still associated with the school very closely
it might still work though
oh yeah i forgot about that
isnt it just on mccsc website?
im sure it will be at bestbuy and stuff
yeah i really wish i was into art so i could use all the cool surface tech microsoft has
ok december 1st i think
when does it come out?
it's new technology it will take a while but it's far suprerior in every way
my desktop has one
google's chromebooks use it
thats why i said apple is fucking up their phones
its like the top of the line mobile card
it's a mobile card but still
keenan did you see that the surface studio has dedicated graphics
dont get me wrong apple is fucking up with their phones but their computers have always been top notch
the lack of a physical esc is bothering but honestly i always have caps lock mapped to esc anyway
there are lots of uses in design work and programming
and honestly a touch bar like that is pretty innovative
and it charges to full in 1 hour
my phone has one
hell there are rumors the switch will have one
high speed data transfer, audio output, video output, video output chaing, rapid power supply, and more
thats fucking usb-c the golden standard of ports that everyone should be using and will be in the near future
those arent fucking "4 proprietary ports that no one uses"
can i defend the new macbook for a second
It's like Nintendo space world which they haven't done since the unveil of the gameboy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Space_World?wprov=sfla1
But the difference is that it was a venue at e3 shared by Sony and Microsoft.
This is the biggest venue in Japan and it's just them.
I'm trying to say this thing is the scale of e3 but just Nintendo
So the switch presentation is going to be in the largest convention center in Japan and they are renting it out for a full 3 days to not just do announcements but open up demos to the general public.
This is the first time Nintendo has presented on stage since 2012, pretty big deal
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/791455799302246400
<@!127535721857679362>
game?
boys
but im pretty sure im capable of it
might also be able to do it in four years but everyone ive talked to said thats a bad idea
i might stay an extra semester and get a masters
still a fine-arts portfolio
it does if you sell it
thats why i said put your shit in a book
most of the super heroes are too famous to mingle with random comic book nerds
that's basically what this comes down to
keenan would you rather meet reggie or luke cage
or heavy fog
and maybe mix it up a bit once in a while with snow
my ideal weather is everyday is autumn and raining
and the weather is like fall all year around
i think thats pretty good
91.3% screen to body ratio
because i dont have 50 pets
yeah but for all my purposes iu housing is fine
my rent is only 500
are you sure
maybe not twice
but live in a twice as expensive environment
when you have a degree thats when you get to be a senior software engineer
like you can be a software engineer at reddit without a college degree as long as you have 5 years ofexperience
also im practically already qualified for some of these jobs at reddit
in what fields./ what companies
yeah what
job listings for what
ya boy except stuff generaly pays more there too
does anyone want to play
fuck vr thats the most beautiful computer ive ever seen
<@!155893986605793281> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzMLA8YIgG0
keenan
and that section was the size of the entirety of ocarina of time
since they only showed us 2% of the map
well i just hope botw is super expansive and deep at the same time
but still if you compare it to pokemon or something 7 towns is small
twilight just has a large map compared to other zelda games
probably more than 5 like in other zelda games
but they also didnt show any dungeons or cities or boss battles which is where normally the melodies come from
judging from the e3 footage, it was mostly ambience
im pretty sure botw will be like that too
im fine with that i just actually have to be playing the game not listening to it on its own
there weren't many melodies
yeah i noticed that
which is why breath of the wild is also hype
the best thing about skyward sword was that it was entirely real orchestra
from all 180 songs or whatever i think i only added 5 or 6
on to twilight princess
tbh skyward sword soundtrack was not that special
thatd be gaming geared
no
why dont you buy one instead of your life sized statue
then VR modeling specialist would be a position in a lot of companies
like paint
id imagine 3d comics as more loose
i feel like strict 3d modeling isnt really good for actual artwork like comics
either way its a good starting point to get used to the platform
no idea but probably not
or see if it exists yet
you need to find better software than tiltbrush though
keenan you have to make a business out of this
you can create 3d hentai
yeah
yea thats what i just said keenan
a very early version
ive tried an oculus
this is literally what valve has been working on for the past 3 years instead of games
it's an 800 dollar device
thats like asking how is a nintendo switch better for mobile gaming than my phone
and you will have been the first
because you are the only 3d comic artist
and make a living
keenan you can be the first 3d comic creator
i dont really know how the platform is set up
keenan this can be your breakthrough
beause it will probably only get cheaper and controllers will get better and more sensitive
its still new tech
i would still wait
yeh
its more for painting not modeling
it was mostly a proof of concept but google owns it so im sure they will develop it into something better eventually
tilt brush is pretty good
im trying to look for research applications so i can convince my lab to buy one
im bypassing the first gen so they work out whatever kinks there are
when the next generation of the vive coes out i might buy one
i mean the ones you put your phone in are cheap you just need one that comes with a controller
it's called tilt brush and it's just an app that will work with any vr headset
yeah
yeah storage is super cheap
daydream
i just did because i had it laying around
didnt have to upgrade to 16  either
i used to use 8 and that was fine
no i use 16 though
daydream
i just dont
ronald i can print whatever i want from my lab
because when i have time for that i'll have time for figure painting
when i build my own 3d printer i'll get into that
right now
too lazy to get the paint or learn how
thats great and when i want a metagross i'll 3d print it
keenan there's a certain draw for me of having official things
i cant paint
this is still cheaper than pokemon cards and infinitely better so im okay with beginning to collect amiibos
ugly
no
idk
or 3
maybe i would take up to 2 of the same
it has to be unique
no
next time i see you keep that in mind
if you present me with amiibo, i will probably give you 6 dollars for it no matter what it is
stealing them from children?
toys r us is too far
how
😦
best buy has some sales at like 13 i think
15-20 dollars isnt bad
sad thing is amiibos wont die for a while
next time i go to best buy
or i will get really into them
i just need to get really into those
honestly im pretty comfortable with amiibos
i would pay 700 for a lifesize statue of metagross thats real metal and actually levitates
I thought it was plastic
Oh wow
What's the material
Why the fuck is that 700
Can I please see a picture of the item I am a gracious investor for?
Cool I will do that
So like 1 day every two years
If i give you 1 dollar can I own it for 1/700th of the time
Now I feel like you just don't care about my advice lol
Not just the computer itself
The true cost of a computer often is all the monitors/keyboard/mice/etc that you eventually get with it
I mean all those accessories are a really a steal
I don't disagree with whatever your reasons are I'm simply saying it's not as good of a deal as you think
Exactly.
A top of the line card from 2 years ago is equivalent to a mid tier card today and that mid tier card is about the same price
With the accessories it's probably worth it but to be honest Ronald built his computer for 600-700 and I think Ronald's is more powerful
For your own sake
Look I'm pretty sure you're getting a good deal I just want to make sure
I don't want to talk about my computer though
Considering i spent twice what he did on the graphics card then no
I doubt it
Since tech improves
That's a lot but depending on how old it is you can typically get similar specced stuff for less today
It doesn't matter how much he's a geek you really have to know objectively
Then how don't you know the specs
Trust me you don't want to spend 600 on a computer if you could build a new one with the same specs for less
Bro
But you don't know that objectively
You don't just but a pc without knowing the specs
How can you not know
What are specs
Ooh what's the pc
Mai my because I don't understand Japanese
If they are Japanese lyrics it can be fine
Ok
Latter
So do I need to add smt4 to my to-do list
What kind
What's persona 4
Ost
Is this whole post good?
If you 8 space it, it will be 57 pages
So I was basically right
But you removed the hyphen and wrote 57?
This isn't even a real song but Its so soothing https://youtu.be/pLmuPsmnbJo
Just so you know you are always welcome to play mario platformers when i invite you over to my million dollar rooftop parties
Where you can't stop playing mario so you just bring it with you
Million dollar home rooftop parties
I just love how Nintendo portrayed that as a thing that normally happens
Now Karen is really famous though
Well he's part of a VGM band so I'm sure everyone in his life said that to him
And by the way it's rubberised and squarish it looks so damn comfortable too
But that same guy said he got to hold the pro controller for a while and said it's by far the most comfortable controller
There was a Japan team and European team like as role descriptions
The European team captain was just his role
One of the actors who acted in it did an interview and he explained the whole process
It's not
No wait Ti is where they get their inspiration for Splatoon esports
And is making a dota competitor
What if Reggie secretly and been going to every Ti
And Nintendo
If i got to Seattle i can actually go to TI
Fuck
Not that it's bad i just can't spend my whole life here
Because I'm tired of Bloomington
Although I almost certainly won't do grad at IU
Unfortunately for me
Problem is that IU has a really high ranking cognitive science program
For grad school it's not the location it's the faculty there and who you'll be researching with
Maybe
UNC
Look what happened to Ronald
Just like we lost Ronald
Asher we are going to lose you
Lol
Or are you helping a sibling
Are you applying?
F stands for fast food
Literally any other night i would get fast food with you but I absolutely can't unless you want me to fail my math class
I just got home and haven't made any progress
And it's starting to interfere with my working ability
I check the subreddit 4-5 times a day
Keenan i have a real addiction to the Nintendo Switch
I could get my dad or mom into pokemon by just letting them play my gameboy i guarantee it
Pokemon Go made it really easy to try
My theory about pokemon is that everyone would love it if they just tried it
No pokemon?
No sell.
Welp that pretty much sums that up
"Ngage attempted to lure gamers away from the GBA.
This was unsuccessful."
It's not just about the phone, also consider the company.
I've heard mixed things about oneplus support
For me I don't think any customization really matters because i always use a case and cases can be customized even further anyway
Not with images though
For moto, basically.
You can't change it later but you can customize it when you buy
But of you had to pick between oneplus2 and moto pure i would do moto pure for sure.
I just trust Motorola more and you can customize it
Yeah it you are looking at phones from last year the 6p was the highest rated Android phone.
And the 6p might go on sale at some point for 300
The Nexus 5X is also a phone from last year that is around that price
Moto probably has better customer support.
Oneplus is a smaller company.
I've had good experience with moto
Ronald stop texting and driving
K
Shh he may never come back
Yeah chain just fell off.
Put it back on in like 10 sec
You suck at cooking
The new YSAC is pretty good
But I'm also slightly dumb
Because i have 35 in ocarina so far
Shorter than ocarin
It will take at least 40 hours for each of these you knoe
Nostalgia in 10 years
Fine
If you can't even play them
Well what's the point of splitting the HD versions then
To who
Why
We can split the HD versions
We can do twilight princess though
But not for the first time
I thought you've already played ss
Differently
I play games very difficult than you
The real work will come when I have to play through all these games before breath of the wild
I was hoping to knock skyward sword out in a day
Just liek final fantasy
That was a week long project
This is practically work to listen to
Ugh why does the skyward sword soundtrack have to be 6 hours long
no
i feel like that would turn into a pretty big waste of water
with the switch, if my hands are cold, i can put both controllers in my pockets and play from there
keenan the future is already here
because they were so close
actually you could operate both d-pad and the two buttons with one toe
well
back in the gameboy life was even harder
also luckiliy touchscreen pokemon ui's where big enough to operate with a toe
luckily pokemon is not that intense
cant play it easily with your feet while sitting on the toilet
but that was the main problem with the ds
no
i can play wit my feet probably
thinks about the possibilies keenan
that was by far the best thing about the wiimote/nunchuck combo that made it so comfortable
but without wires
so you're hands dont haeve to be next to each other
the fact that you can have half of a controller in each hand
keenan you know what im most hyped out the switch
no problem with that
lol
isnt wwe just reality tv
lol
oh ok so that makes you better than everyone
and im not even a medical dude
but i at least tried it
i mean i havent either
i dont even think he's seen scrubs
by new i mean episodes are still cooming out
and he watches a lot of that
but there's a new one called "iZombie" which just from the name sounds terrible
which some i've heard are good
he watches those medical shows too
nikhil literally thinks arrow is better than luke cage and/or daredevil
it probably still sucks
are you talking about the show
yeah
what class doesnt let hyou have your laptop
"you're hired'
"yes"
second interview question: "do you own a wii u?"
nintendo: "gtfo"
"uh i haven't finished that game"
first interview question: "what did you think about the final boss in ocarina of time?"
then i would be rejected immediately
i could just go into R&D
i need something where i know about the next games and consoles years before release
but that sounds boring
i feel like i could do a web managing position fairly easily though
the actual game development positions are probably super competitive
thats for you
Coordinator, Social Media
besides the web stuff
most of these senior development positions require 5  years experience
i could be a translator
ugh if only i knew japaneese
what do you know...
nintendo is hiring a mobile game developer
yeah i really want to live there
i dont ahve a degree yet
well most need degrees
maybe not easily
dude i could easily get a job at nintendo
google hasn't failed me
oh good
i better get a 1-up from this
no
but it's good that they understand the goal of video games is to have fun so even as a billion dollar company they have fun
they they fucking murder you
i think nintendo's corporate casualness is what makes them so greate
this guy is a genius too
shit reggie used to do the marketing for pizza hut
and they aren't some small indie company either
like what other company does that
the thing i most like about nintendo is that their execs do stupid skits
he's pretty good at determining what mods to buy
does gabe actually do development though
"hobby is guessing the measurement of objects"
"enjoys rearranging the furniture in his house"
"semi-professional dog breed"
lol his personal life section on wikipedia is hilarious
yeah but i dont know how much stan lee actually does either
but how much does he actually do in those games
im pretty sure he's just listed as creative director/executive producer on everything
i dont know how much miyamoto has influence over the games these days
i was sad when iwata died but man when miyamoto dies idk what i'll do with my life
why does his signature have eyes

can we talk about miyamoto now
even without competition you cant deny that nintendo's handheld line is just good in it's own right
and nintendo has always been on top of handheld industry
it's ok i forgive Yokoi because he made the gameboy too
however if they had the right technology it would have worked
and nintendo was even dumber for pushing it to market
people in charge of virtual boy were dumb as well by not realizing the technology wasnt there yet until halfway through
i could have taken their concept and marketed and engineered a system that actually sold units
yeah thats true but the reason the ouya was a bad design idea was because the people at the company were dumb
and people have
someone could take the idea of virtual realtiy gaming and make a good product too
im saying someone could take the idea of a cheap home console that plays android games and turn it into a successful product
the idea of a flying machine is good but their design ideas were not good
i mean he has boobs in his signature
can we talk about how cool miyamoto is
but no you have to be dumb
YEAH ME TOO
just because halway through you realize what you made is bad doesnt mean tht eomotivation was bad
my definition of idea is the initial motivation behind the system
*idea*
not the virtual boy
and part of the reason it may have done that is because it was nintendo's primary focus
and it was more like 3.5 years
not 1 year
which is more usual of a console gap
and the time between gba and ds was 3 years
ugh keenan
considering they had a team working on the 64 concurrently, and that miyamoto had no involvement with the system, the virtual boy was definitely not meant to be a next gen console between the snes and n64
and the final console wasnt even intended for release
also wikipedia clearly says the virtual boy was an experiment
keenan find me a source that says the n64 was supposed to have virtualboy compatibility
im saying that because the n64 came literally a year after it, meaning they were probably working on the n64 long before the virtual boy came out
im not saying that because it failed
it was just a thing on a the side
the virtual boy was obviously not meant to be the "next gen" nintendo console
yes keenan which is why they released the n64 one year later
ok keenan you can argue thats it's not VR when literally all the media and marketing surrounding it referred to the virtual boy as VR
uhuh
what did i just say
....
back then that was pretty much VR
keenan our definition of VR has changed as we got better technology
and that it's a headset and personalized display
it's as much VR as they could get it back then
i highgly doubt they were close to going bankrupt or anything
"someday this will be great, but lets just see what happens if we try to do it now"
i have a feeling nintendo knew that too which is why it was more of an experiment
turns out thats a pretty good idea
VR gaming
even if back in the 90s it didnt show it
the concept of virtual boy also proved to be successful
the concept for ouya proved successful
i just said if executed better it could have been good
i never said it did
i dont know you tell me, you said so yourself
i think you lost this argument
which is why it got 8.5million funding
keenan i dont know why you dont see that their concept was perfectly fine
"ouya is a good idea if done right" -keenan
and when executed properly, they could have succeeded
im arguing that they're not
you started off this conversation with ouya is a bad idea and virtual boy is a bad idea
how is that relevant
ok?
no
yes but not because they were bad ideas
just like virtual boy was
thats what ive been trying to say keenan
there's a difference between bad idea and bad execution
doesnt make it a bad idea
they knew it was good idea the tech wasnt there yet
considering where VR is now i'd say they pretty accurately predicted the future
the virtual boy was nintendo having enough money to fuck around for a bit and try something crazy
hence why people bought it
but still appealing if you make it cheap enough
ouya is a lot worse than thsoe comparitively
i dont think either of those ideas were bad keenan
considering the asking price was 99 i think it could have worked if they weren't idiots
their ceo was truly an idiot
This is funny https://youtu.be/xTqhyHuKVKA
Yeah have a lot of work to do
I just woke up
The pokemon meta needs to reward people for thinking outside the box more
Didn't we used to have that guy who won with non traditional teams
And not like small games either.
Feel like an idiot
Lol i just learned that Bethesda makes games other than the elder scrolls and fallout
not even as joke but it would just be his normal voice
i hope he sings like k.k.
too
thats what im reading
it's always there just really quiet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uio3PGjiAqo
this guy is a legend
is it just like an easter egg in all his games
whats so special about it
no
or the shop music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPoQbcqU5Ec sounds like the wii menu/plaza music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afw88tiacmQ
it's fucking mario paint
also why is the mario paint music so good
k i'll probably be about 30 min
so it's now or never
ya
well i want to level up once and then buy loot boxes
so im going to buy loot boxes
but todaay is my last real day to play before halloween event is over
i need to do a few more things like with your website and other site
do you want to play a bit of overwatch soon?
i think ive only heard of him one time and that was in the lego marvel game
sure
when
is that a marvel movie
song of the week https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pn0yEke6Ig
the world was exposed to our memes but no one realized
its not but the only people involved in it are you guys and it's in the style of discord posts
dog song
when our discord leaks on facebook
an actor in the switch ad tells his story
this was extremely interesting https://www.twitch.tv/dickhiskhan/v/96441430
https://www.amazon.com/b?node=14866317011
and apparently it's good too
what the hell this is a wind waker clone on steam http://store.steampowered.com/app/339200/
I AM READY
HELLO
so his comics werent normally like that
i see
i guess i just have to understand the format/style of ctrl-alt-del comics more to understand why the meme of it is funny
wait so was the original loss comic supposed to funny or was it something that happened in the creators personal life that he expressed in his characters
oh wait now that you mention it's a poem i think i recognize it
but how is the text one I II II L
i see how that one works
i dont see how the text one is a loss jpg
thanks
i dont get either joke
can someone explain the joke
k
o
ok what
i will try to be home around 8:30 or 9 so yeah
Apparently soldier 76 is from Bloomington Indiana
I peed an hour ago.
It was a pretty good pee
I'll play a lot Saturday and Sunday because i dont have much homework
Also sorry ronald i think I'm going to go to bed.
I don't think my body can function properly over 20 hours of being awake and i just get this sickness feeling.
I've been up since 5am with no nap
i love how siri has been out for like 5 years and google assistant has only been out for a month but google is already better
im feeling kind of sick i havent really eaten anything
by not drinking
also the only liquid i drank during that period was two cups of sprite
extreme self discipline
actually first i get to experience the hallway
im going to leave now for the first time and remember what the outdoors is like
even for food or bathroom
guys i literally haven't left my lab for 12 hours straight
then i would sell it on ebay as a leaked model
mine would look beautiful of course
it was hilariously bad but it's totally something i would do if i had the time or the foam
this mockup gets more and more hilarious the more you scroll down https://imgur.com/a/4meRW
this is such a good trailer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfgNrhauvLo&feature=youtu.be
we need a better lame joke then
that joke actually makes sense for the switch
Why is the Nintendo Switch called a Switch?
Because you do a Switch and then walk away.
WOW HOW DOES IT ALREADY HAVE 11 MILLION VIEWS
i just think it's better at full quality
i dont think it was designed that way
what that she can be the best in the world and stillget all her homework done?
maybe it enhances their authenticity but not their quality
uh huh
not amazing
shitty ds speakers mean shitty
i really disagree with that
ashley is the best song in that series
oh i see
where?
like once every 3 years
nintendo should release real K.K.
Slider albums on itunes or something
it's really bothering me because some parts literally sound like he's blowing his nose on purpose as part of the song
I can't tell if K.K.
Slider does some acapella or the midi isn't high enough quality to distinguish between instrument and voice
yeah i'll probably explode if i dont play anything tonight
what do you think?
and there's a ton of information in it too
omg gamexplain literally made an 11 minute analysis video based on the 6 seconds of mario footage on the NS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFGAJtnky7A
the song that birthed your axolotls
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X23Fzs1QBZA <@!155893986605793281> was this it?
im entirely relying on pokemon to save me from the fact that we wont get more NS news until next year
too much work
so the extra price can go to things that actually matter
the NS doesn't seem like it has a camera or a touchscreen which seems like a good thing
hope it's not just pikapark 2 or some shit
looks like the ceo of the pokemon company confirmed pokemon games on NS
i cant
Exactly
As a half parody
You should get into a huge Facebook debate with him like people do with politics
I want to see
Keenan come to class today so I can see you
we can only go off personal experience
i feel like none of us really know enough about how game servers work to really be debating this
thats not how it works keenan
no
but they are functional tablets
they are like 50 bucks
have you seen the latest kindle fires
like if i host an aoe lobby it might be running the server off of my computer
because its only like 4-8 player
those smaller online games are probably just hosted on someones computer
age of empires isnt that problematic
or the developer is big enough like activision for call of duty
but in my experience they've all had good servers
sure
the onlny thing i can think of that's really popular is civ
wow?
or what game do people really play online on steam that isn't a valve game
but honestly what online steam game has bad servers
except for valve games of course
in the case of steam i think developers host them
games on steams use their own servers for online too
i dont think you understand
well then you're wrong
and nintendo network which is worse
whcih is better
the only other free ones are steam
other free ones
but a free service doesnt have to be shit either
well yeah because they want people to think that their money is going towards a quality service
and more people with kindles means more people buying books  or apps from their store
they sell them at a loss but then expect that you'll use their online stores
because amazon does that with the kindles
i honestly think psn and xbox live have a subscription not to help pay for servers but so sony and microsoft can make a profit off of selling their hardware at a low price
cant argue with that logic
ok you win
and you dont have to pay for servers
steam has good online
keenan how can we trust you when you dont even have a functioning ps4
well they might already use ads idk
because without a subscription they might have to use ads to make a profit
i think part o the reason there's a subscription is the make the initial cost of the hardware lower
convencience is also a factor
the only advantage of an xbox one over a traditional PC is that it's cheaper
xbox games are released on steam
but microsoft is already heading in that direction
it would not be on discs
people buy ps4s and xboxs because they dont want to spend a lot of a good PC and they want a modern library
not good enough to the point where it's why people buy their consoles
all the best exclusive ps4 games are also on xbox and by third parties
but when you think of sony you dont think of game developers
sony could definitely make exclusive ps4 games
just because they are amazing at making games
and they would still get tons of sales
like nintendo could have the shittiest graphics and shittiest online capability
because the games are always the reason people buy nintendo stuff
i think sony and microsoft really just need to make more first party exclusive games
i feel like now would be a really good time to invest in nintendo
yeah
RONALD FOCUS
i dont understand how sony and microsoft are going to make a successful new console without using the same exact concept of the NS
thats always been my strategy.
buy a nintendo console since it has the most exclusives and then use a PC for every other game
the wii u really doesnt though
except the the wii had pretty good third party support just because it was the most popular console at the time
yeah ever since the wii nintendo has had problems with third party support
well first of all in 2006 this technology wasnt there yet
lol
when does skyrim hd come out?
and you dont think they can do the same for any other console?
ronald how does a ps4 run skyrim
i think it will get tthe fallout games, the only reason they showed skyrim was because skyrim hd is the going to be the most recent bethesda game
ps4 probably still has better graphics
yeah why not
it's sometimes even referred to GBA "Skyrim edition"
thats literally all it is
its just a gameboy advance that plays skyrim
ronald imagine the gameboy advanced
ronald now you can play skyrim while you're pooping
this is some crazy cyclical shit
i wonder if when the joycons are attached if the pad will have more battery life than when it's just a tablet
the pad you will be holding has three separate battery packs
there are so many batteries
great.
the AXYB do seem kind of large
nintendo invented buttons
but keenan
like come on
nintendo doesnt ever fuck up buttons
i feel like buttons are pretty easy to change
in the wii u reveal trailer the gamepad had flat circle pads instead of real analog sticks
a lot of it might not be finalized
the pro controller not the joycon one
i hope that square controller is comfortable
because the normal pro controller is sort of squarish this time
its the first thing i noticed
yeah the controller does
in the future i'll be playing dota with a Joy-con
theres a reason they got off that one pretty quick
lol
well i mean the nes controller was the first dpad so theres that
i mean the nes and snes controller
nintendo hasnt innovated this hard since they invented the modern gaming controller
but what technology is nintendo whopping out of their ass that does this
i understand one thing is designed for gaming and the other is not
why cant it play skyrim
like my phone costed 500 bucks
i still cant believe they can fit these huge games like botw and skyrim on what is practically a tablet with nvidia tegra graphics
true it would be a direct thing
since it's not a direct connection
it depends too much on your internet connection
steam home streaming also scuks
and keep it at a low price
the fact that it sucked on the vita makes me think it is not a "pretty easy" thing to do
but input would be considerably delayed
like watching netflix on a chromecast
it would be good for viewing
i cant imagine that would be low latency enough to play
not the other way around
the ps4 streamed to the vita
no
k boy
"pretty easy"
and the base station may just boost it up when plugged in
or if it's all in the gamepad
i cant tell if there is a separate graphics driver in the gamepad and the base station
did you read this?
https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/10/20/nintendo-switch/
but im pretty sure it cant because the base station probably uses the internals of the game pad to run
stuff like that
like im wondering if you can do that on NS
completely independent of each other
where one person uses game pad and other person uses tv
games like splatoon have 1 on 1 mode
the touchpad is extremely useful in pikmin 3
i haven't played all of the first party games onthe wii u but im sure nintendo has cclever mechanics built in for some of them
you can buy any of those games separately
well they are
of the game
thats the whole point
they dont
yes keenan for nnintendo land they specifically designed concepts that use the gamepad in creative ways
it is mandatory for those types of gamess
people noted that the inklings look different
no it could be a sequel
some of the party games like nintendo land and mario party and others no doubt use it
certain mechanics in the super mario bros U allow a player with the touchpad to build things while other people play
but it's not mandatory
well its nice to have an inventory and stuff on the bottom screen while you play on the top screen
because im pretty sure you cant use the screen and play on the tv at the same time
i dont think it will be backwayds compatable with wii u
i just like having them
even if i wouldn't play them
although it's really hard for me refrain from buying every single retro console from gameworld
especially new hardware
well im abnormally obsessed about hardware
but you did buy the 3ds near launch
when the 3ds was announced i kept it as a wallpaper from e3 until it was released
i need to find a good NS wallpaper
cool
better than most trailers
that trailer was pretty good too
sinces you know he regens
but wolf man still lives
when everyone dies
it seems like in the future
this isn't the origin story right?
because normally trailers aren't that interesting to me
i dont see any other reasons why a trailer would have that much hype
wait did no one expect this movie or something?
6.
RDR2
5.
Nuclear reactor
4.
George Bush
3.
Logan
2.
NS
1.
NS
im pretty sure people watched that trailer
keenan have you seen r/all?
is that the Logan?
and then i bet there will be civ 6 spam later ddoay
had to sort through all the NS spam then an hour later have to sort through all the rdr2 spam when the ns is still spam is still coming
i feel bad for the moderators of r/gaming
people carry tablets around all the time
guys the NS is no bigger than a tablet
i have problems with buy hardware
no joke
if they only made one game for it and that game was called breath of the wild i would still buy it day one
asher it already has a good lineup
its not
not more than a nunchuck
these wont be more than 20
and joy con's cant be that expensive
im kind of worried about that but nintendo has always made high quality hardware
maybe if you jam it in real hard
the game card slot looks like it could fit a 3ds cartridge
I CANT THINK ABOUT THAT NOW
STOP
and i have so much work to do
i wont be able to focus in any classes today
UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
its more like 10 on nds games
i mean the 3ds is only 5 hours when playing 3ds games
like airplane rides
and the battery will be sure long enough to last you anywhere there aren't outlets
wall outlets are plentiful
if all you have to carry with you to play skyrim on the go is a charger i wont care
literally my only dream
it's the fact that you can play them on mobile
the best part isnt skyrim or breath of the wild
UGH
keenan
ALSO FUCK
keenan find me a screenshot of skyrim
hell, smartwatches these days are 350
the wii u was initially 350
wasnt the ps4 initiall 400
where can i find screenshot of skyrim on it
since he wont buy one
and then each give one of the Joy-cons to ronald
we should all buy one
because kids
thats the only reason their online is dumbed down a bit
the fact that everyrone in the trailer is like over 25 kind of makes me think nintendo will have more of a mature online platform
you dont see people gathering around an ipad with controllers playing shit
i dont think people are ready for that
can you imagine that in real llife?
look at that image of the four people playing NBA with the half controllers
http://i.imgur.com/2UhuWp5.jpg
online will be at least as good as the wii u which isn't bad
but dude can you imagine
you might say your body is ready for this but really this is too much innovation to handle
and the world isnt ready
that nintendo innovated too much
i  have this deep fear
honestly my only concern
we can just call it the NS
"sorry guys there's no way we can beat this, give us another 3 years it will be on the nx"
inb4 rockstar just cancels their announcement in 7 minutes
rip
no Rcokstar
#WalletsOutforIwata
he died for this
this was iwatas legacy
im just excited for nintendo
i dont even play skyrim
this is too  much
im shaking
where
when bethesda starts making games for nintendo consoles
you know how big of a deal this is
FUCK
and splatoon
all i noticed was zeldo and mario
was it in the trailer
is skyrim on it?
wait
i need to read some articles for my cog sci class in 30 minutes but instead i think im going to read discussions about the switch
at this rate the day the nx releases will be a national holiday and everyone will get off work
I love the tech community
Lol the people i was meeting with were literally talking about the nx when i walked in
they basically just announced the international for splatoon
2nd thought: literally splatoon esports
way smaller than any other console
1st thought: how is the docking station so fucking small
idl
or is it gist
you'l get the jist of it
just read chat
NX stands for Non-eXistant
they havent because it's all just a prank
nintendo could at least start the stream and just display a static image so we know it's at least working
i have both open just in case
also any livestreaming site will automatically start the stream whenever it goes live
youtube has no memes though
there's like a billion people in chat
is this all just a prank
how come nintendo's twitch stream isnt even up
it's such a beautiful day today
arent you proud
so only like 50% nintendo!
then anotherr 100 are misc nintendo stuff
my playlist is almost 400 songs and 100 of them are going to be smash
i realized that i can bike to a location thats really close to the meeting location and watch it there to reduce the overall time that im late
keenan i might not be able to do an NX hype call
i thought you were being dat boi
poor japanese people have to wait all day for nx where i can just go to sleep and wake up and it will be here
id practically be a legend
imagine if i was playing it in class
but damn i have friends who play pokemon in that class
class at 9 am
cant do it
it's a thursday night
no wait
oh wow that's even a friday night
what/
no
i need cargo pants to ensure i can carry my phone wallet keys calculator ds and food
ugh everyone on twitter is talking about the debate but i want people to be hyping about the NX
cargo pants/shorts only make up like 40% of my pants but they are useful
but i mean just casual stuff
except for dress clothes of course
by shirt i meant general any clothing item
idk
well maybe i would if i saw the available shirts
im never going to spend more than 20 dollars on a shirt
like they only sell their clothes
so are they brands?
you guys should take me clothes shopping
or brand stores
besides clothing store i guess?
i dont really know what either express or h and m are
i bet a girl you have a crush on works at express too but you just dont know it yet
even if i dont buy it
i like new technology
but i just like new devices
because really it should be the games
dont know why
hardware is always the thing im most hyped for
i cant remember the last time there was a hardware reveal that i was expecting to happen soon where some info wasn't leaked before
anyway
so i dont know if it really matters
but in japan people will go to sleep and have the whole next day
i guess then you have the whole day for people to read the news
it will last 3 minutes then im booking it
so keenan call at 10?
because i have a meeting at 10
nope
but 11pm japan is
because 10am EST is definittely not ideal
well im pretty sure nintendo plans their shit around the ideal time for japan
that cant be a coincidence
because the rdr2 trailer comes out literally an hour after the nx trailer
what if it's a launch title
shiiiiit
what if
shit...
and general hype
but the media coverage of the nx will by far overwhelm it
i bet rockstar is saying "well shit" right now
or they will be watching it in their office and be secretly hoping im late
im meeting with an IT team at the undergraduate education office and last time I met with them they seemed like decently nerdy people so i bet there's a chance they'll be watching it too
yeah it will still be going on tomorrow morning so it's a valid excuse
"rain"
ok apparently the trailer will only be 3 minutes long so i can just be late to my meeting and watch it live
i cant believe i have a meeting at 10 and a class directly after at 11
https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoNX/comments/58drhg/tomorrow_is_finally_here_hype_thread/
and half of them were saying we wouldn't get anything till next year
i was literally checking it in class just 2 hours ago
something, anything
i mean for 1.5 year
they've been the most desperate for something for years
lol have you guys seen the nintendonx subreddit
"The morphling slipped on the banana peel, died and is now complaining about it"
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/589sn8/the_lgd_vs_lgdy_game_has_bananas_in_it_right_now/ lol
too bad by the time i bike home it probably wont be raining anymore
i bet

im pretty sure in my playlist i have at least 6 different versions of the same jungle theme
idk this song right now is Hiroyuki Kawada not david wise
the entire donkey kong series soundtrack is quickly moving up my ranks of all soundtracks
i also love how smash is already a nintendo-curated playlist of the best music from their games
i mean charcters unique to the series
neither is baroque then
although now that i think of it fawful might be a trophy
i said unique characters
or no unique characters from that game
even though there are no stages from that game
it's interesting that the smash 4 sound track has two songs from bowser's inside story in it
https://i.redditmedia.com/QLlEPXvk1KYsdkL1fQzP3j39pqH6GE40htfFo79_2hI.png?w=605&s=e63006dbfb8e8f83f86d7eccaacc15be
the water thing is definitely i notice and care about
although if you really have to wear this costume every time you battle or ride whats the point of dressing up your trainer
it would be hilarious
i hope this riding thing replaces the bike
shit i can ride tauros through the fucking city
oh of course there are slowpoke blocking the pathways
i love these gangster hand gestures team skull does
its ok i can still play pokemon demo alone
😦
meeting ran late and then i got distracted with people afterwards
?
i guess you guys arent playing overwatch anymore
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds6I5sUBGtw&feature=youtu.be
can you ask them why their logo looks like an H
i can play at like 9
You guys are casuals, I'm playing 1v11 every game

Also Ronald I'm laughing at that so much right now
Member descriptions is our sidebar list of who's online
Asher now that you have a 3ds you have no excuse not to know what's going in this chat
gamefreak tried to scrub everything not related to the demo but they forgot all the shiny sprites and so much more
people have data mined the demo and found pretty much everything about the game
yeah i think nintendo fucked up a little bit
including starter evos
also keenan we have the full dex now
https://twitter.com/ruiisud/status/788211743201734657
from the demo
omg keenan did you see alolan dugtrio?
it's not like sharing your political opinions with your closest friends will make them not your closest friends anymore
but why does it matter
apparently he doesnt want anyone knowing anything
just keenan's political shit though
only that his entire ballot was centered around abortion and that this conversation was funnier without the context of his first message
keenan im screenshotting all your messages
no one has any excuse not to vote in local elections
ah yes discord finally gets serious
im pretty sure everyone already knows who will win
lol
i stopped wathcing the republican debates after ben carson dropped out because they went from being the amusing type of cringe to just the normal type of cringe
but now there's nothing left to discuss since no one really likes any of the two candidates
back in the primaries when there were candidates that i liked and candidates that ronald liked we would have long political discussions about it
but it definitely has something to do with the fact i cant bring myself to make any facebook post
why would that be a joke
wow thats impressive i can never bring myself to make a political post even though there are several times when i want to
i'll give you 12 for green
anyway let me know if you get it so i can give you ten
i dont think yoshi's wooly world comes with waluigi
i'd buy either but would prefer green
do they have green?
i just want the amiibo
yeah that works too
dont lol me
if i give you 20
can i still have the amiibo
ok
speaking of amiibos
it seems like one of those dvd extra content quizes
what is that game
omg baby link is so cute

only murderers irl can do genocide runs but any normal asshole can do a partial run no prob
you  should be able to at least do the partial run though right?
well one of the endingsis a result of  doing genocide
if you arent going to do one you should at least look at videos
i havent either
keenan you havent even gotten to genocide run yet how can you say the bosses are hard
but at least you were determined
can we play games btw
whats the current state of BIS
but that game is designed to be difficult to 100%, not difficult to beat
the downside of that is that game overs dont mean anything
i dont know if you've gotten to the escher-style rooms where the 3d effect actually adds a gameplay element to completeing them
3d land doesnt have cats yo
wow you're just as bad as ronald now keenan
i usually just use the website http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/MmoER_2Hlv50ZUt35Tb5YpHrhhNU57I6
i think they design it to be for browsing mostly
what do you mean
you may have tons of games to work through but soon you'll realize that in the end all that matters is <:god:230133457630658562>
<:god:230133457630658562>
like pokemon right?
the soundtrack is 4 and half hours long
that game is massive
people say it's really good and since it was ported over to the new 3ds ive been tempted to try it
you should consider getting xenoblade at some point
oh yeah
also does this mean that you're going to get really into jrpgs now?
i guess for me i did hae to redownload it because i did a system transfer first
oh
i only have one here
i do but it's at my parents house
at campus
you'll also need to make a nintendo network accound to download the mario game from the eshop because it's not pre-installed
it should include a 4gb one
yes
yeah the only good faceplate on nintendo's official site is this one https://store.nintendo.com/ng3/us/po/browse/productDetailColorSizePicker.jsp?categoryNav=true&navAction=jump&navCount=0&atg.multisite.remap=false&productId=prod780384&categoryId=cat600792
since dsi
because they've been using the same charger for a while
keenan or i probably have an extra
the official nintendo of america selection isn't very good so you pretty much ahve to get a japan import from ebay or amazon
but it should have been white instead of yellow
the mario maker one is ok
i just wish the faceplates that came with that bundle were better
yeah i thought 150 was really good too especially considering the first small new 3ds bundle was an animal crossing one which was 230
thats where i got mine
did target not have it?

even with all the shit shovelware on the nds it does have some good third party titles, more than you might expect though
lol
at the same time im kind of skeptical that it will be  real handheld since they said breath of the wild will be on the nx and that does not look like it could be a handheld game at all
hopefully the nx is a handheld that is more modern in terms of specs like phones
also the 3ds line is over 5 years old now, and even though it was released in 2011 it has a really low resolution screen, which i was always dissappointed about
also i just think nintendo handhelds are their best product
i really hope it's a handheld
soon pls
if i can get in, there are only 15 seats
should be fun
btw i think im going to take a robotics class next semester
modeling what though
my only graphical programming experience is when we made games in scheme
i have almost no experience with graphical interfaces, i either write command line stuff or web interfaces
like non-physical 3d modeling, or sprites?
what do you mean graphics
its a programming language for 3d modeling
look into http://www.openscad.org/
there's a lot you can do with them but i dont know how you would those things to a software/programming project
i was going to build one this summer but never got around to it
well maybe not a lot but more than most
i have a lot of experience with 3d printers
easily done
you only need discrete math, calc 2, and data structures as prerequisites!
yay
look at the csci-B and csci-A classes which are the non-core but elective classes for the major
but im looking at elective courses
yeah im taking data structures next semester

but in case you guys did want to know for future reference my middle name is "Mercy"
hmm
so clara proceeded to ask me
and asked clara
so he asked this chat
maybe asher wanted to know my middle name
or wait
to which i say "why"
clara asks me my middle name.
i say why.
she doesn't answer me.
instead proceeds to ask asher.
who asks us.
which is actually pretty good if i remember correctly
lol im going to listen to the runescape soundtrack
i think instead of being 70% nintendo this playlist is going to en up being 70% jrpg

it's complicated because almost every game has a remake and has an associated piano only version of the ost
that averages out to about 2 per game i guess
well i will have at least 30 total from FF
what do yuo mean
from all the games total
how many songs in the playlist is a reasonable amount to be from final fantasy
dont forget about your post it note
k buddy
this mercy skin is the only one that shows skin
i need to get pharah and mercy
no once you have it you can use it forever they just aren't purchaseable anymore after nov 1

RONADL
im tryin
this is a once in a lifetime offer to play overwatch with me though
you can watch the debate whenever you want
ronald
oh no guys this might be the end of my microphone
guys answer my question
actually maybe not you can probably get a net of 75 max
isnt that more than what you'd be getting if you spent 125 for the new ps4 and then sold that
@everyone yo can we play stuff right now?
im not going to get another chance for the rest of the week
how dare you even consider that
NO RONALD THATS EVEN WORSE OMG
you can replace your broken best friend for a brand new one for 125 but you cant sell the friend
you cant just sell your best friend
had so many great times
you two were only together for a little over a year
but keenan this is sad
used?
you can get it in a bundle with a game for 300
probably not once the new one comes out
arent they like 250 new
keenan a may has standards
yeah well it was one to much
teach em a lesson
maybe you should stop investing in sony products
😦
how would you play overwatch with asher when asher gets a ps4 to play overwatch without us
but how would you play fallout
why dont you care as far as playing
three controllers would be pretty nice i'll admit
how much do you care about the ps4
have you tried kicking it
that plugs into the back
but it still has a power supply cord
thats what happened to my wifi router
^
as an apology
ive heard of graphics card companies sending you the latest version of the card when the old one is faulty
can you get that new model
huh
i think by giving them 125 you are admitting defeat and doing exactly the shit they want you to do
can you extend the warranty
<:sadboy:230133848740986891>
why do they need a 125 service fee
is it not under warranty
or did they just say theycan do it
i mean did they say what the problem was at all so you could find someone else to fix it or fix it yourself
did they say they can fiz it
how do you know it's really broken
i might this thanksgiving or winter break
such as twilight princess
to play a console zelda game
it inspires me
im listening to the soundtrack now
but im thinking it might actually be good
everyone says its not as good as the other games
oh ok
why only 4 hours
why
keenan how much did you play twilight princess
😦
he bought them all
he's a very shady man
literally all the information online about him is related to secret
https://dotablast.com/team-secret-announce-new-team-director-raises-questions/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahraman_Sad%C4%B1ko%C4%9Flu
here's the page for his dad
exactly
yeah i know
literally just a turkish guy who got all his wealth from his father's company and who's greatest accomplishment is being the #1 clash of clans player
lol some people are speculating that secret is a giant money laundering scheme https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/56ollv/serious_is_team_secret_a_money_laundering_scheme/
kemal is a bad owner but im sure a larger portion of why it got so bad was puppey
also they always got other swedish people
there was only one year out of the 4 years of alliance where they had different people than normal
and you hated alliance
ronald alliance was one of the few teams that had that sense
i bet puppey doesnt play pubs because he has legit anger management issues
this wasnt for np it was for secret
doesnt seem that hard to not be terrible
we should start an esports org
and just use office space for bootcamps
im pretty sure all the top orgs pay salaries
and dendi
and xboct
but if puppey/secret doesnt make any statement to clear things up, no one will want to play with secret or puppey ever again
no idea why pieliedie stayed in the first place
i bet mp forev and midone want out
otherwise you might have to pay for housing for the players as well as an office space
but if you think about it, especially for smaller organizations, team houses are a really good deal because it consolidates living arangements and practice space
i tihnk the bigger orgs like eg or liquid dont have houses they have office space basically for bootcamping
secret really is the exception
but there are so many other high quality orgs out there
the players also were dumb for agreeing to play for secret without creal contracts
because secret is a terrible organization run by an attention-seeking greedy idiot
they were colleagues
well they aren't friends
basically EE's blog serves two purposes: to reveal the secrets of secret, and as a reminder to only agree to written contracts
that video isnt even that bad compared to everything else
better mirror with images https://web.archive.org/web/20161009162806/http://npgame.gg/blog/himitsumonogatari.html
it wasnt taken down it was high traffic
he outs puppey, team secret, their owner, and all the shady shit that was going on there
you have to read envy's blog post really
i wonder what mp forev and midone are thinkgin
asher why do you think pie lie die stayed on secret
EE seemed really bummed about it
Also now I'm kind of sad bulba didn't stay on NP
Part of the problem too is that dota players are idiots
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/56ndk3/slug/d8kvb1s
Even when bulbo was on secret i knew it wasn't where i wanted to see him
Can i just say that i suspected this all along
https://youtu.be/lZ94-sUfjrk
No spoilers pls
I haven't opened it yet
Doe at his have to do with envy blog
What's your guys problem with xkcd
whats the joke
https://xkcd.com/611/
there seems to be a lot of hype around this trailer
why not
is it good
what star wars has an mmorpg
what is this knights of the eternal throne thing
also it's weird that luke and matt murdock's nurse are a couple in this show
pretty much exactly
lol the final fight in luke cage is literally just a video game boss
i need like all of these http://www.pokemoncenter.com/accessories-s0104-0000-0000/small-accessories/pok%C3%A9mon-minis#facet:&productBeginIndex:0&facetLimit:&orderBy:5&pageView:grid&minPrice:&maxPrice:&pageSize:&
i might actually buy the wolly yoshi one
why is the only place i can get greninja toys r us
i dont know what i want i just want to see all of them
when i search amiibo on amazon all i get is like the standard lineup
beyond like the standard ones
how do you actually buy amiibos
also keenan
im trying to watch netflix
yes
just by putting the figure on the touch screen
yeah they are figurines that store data with nfc and the 3ds or wii u will read them into your games
majora
they have your favorite character
you should buy some amiibos for "research purposes"
because the coolest thing that uses them is amiibos
i really want to find more creative uses for nfc chips
thats pretty cool
the wemo app does that and works with all their products
i mean anything thats programmable can be programmed to do that
arduino is smaller and made for specific re-programmable tasks
also im pretty sure arduino would be better for doing simple tasks like remote controlled lights since raspberry pi is a full computer
why does the idea have to be original
wemo also has a  light switch you can install
its just a wall outlight that connects to wifi and you can turn it on and off with your phone
yeah i bought a wemo switch when it went on a flash amazon sale
ronald my lights in my apartment room are already remote controlled
why raspberry pi
only with computers
late at night
ronald what if i deliberately get in really late on friday night to avoid going to any house parties
red bull is disgusting
if i competed i would want to do something relatively simple but intriguing
nothing is on friday thats important
i bet the teams that win are the ones who dont eat, sleep, or do any of the other activities
needs more space i guess
thats not true they are all on saturday
like is it possible to make something in more like 12 hours
i kind of dont want to do something too complex so i have time to go to workshops and sleep
unless you are an expert at angluar and all the other platfroms we used
im pretty sure thats impossible
dont you think we should plan something if we are going to
no
yes
are you planning to compete
but if it's not full a few days before then it's pretty likely
the day of lol
i mean it's a 90% chance i can go
yeah i will
there's still a chacne the flights wont work out but i wont know until closer
yeah i need to rsvp by the 14th
or i mean leave it on voicemail
i need to call him with it at some point
whats that for
also ron asked me for my ss#
can tomorrow night though
😦 im at home so i cant play
nvm google is a thing
what happened
damn i really waqqnt to be a meteorologist now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnncWI88xT8
storms are pretty amazing things if you think about it
but never do
everytime there's a tornado watch in bloomington i always wish i could witness the tornado
if storm chasing was safer i would definitely do it
we are alive during history
and it's exciting
there's a hurricane
am i the only one who thinks this hurricane is fucking awesome
ijo[jfdsghjj
haha
dude
asher you have a deadline
he can be fighting anyone
why should he be fighting him
he doesnt go by kingpin much in the show
fisk
oh
i seriously forgot
idk who that is
what should he be fighting
it doesnt matter that the protagonis is defeating them at their own art
i think you're forgetting that the super hero has abilities and the other people dont
hows it problematic
dont remember though
also im pretty sure daredevil's mentor was japanese
if the japanese guy fighting the YEEHAW group had super powers i think he would win too regardless of if he was using non-native fighting tactics to him or not
because the other ninjas dont have super senses
every show uses characters of ethnicity to represent villians
i dont see why thats fucked up
that he can sustain any injury and fight almost anyone while being blind
why is it fucked up
just your typical super senses
hes just a ninja
also this made me realize that daredevil doesnt even really have a power
and have interesting heroes
why cant it be like one punch man
if they give all the super heroes the same power
whats the point of this
against white people
how do you know this isn't racism
all the time
she was definitely cut
no
they dont even need to have her in that one new show where they all fight together
jessica is practically obsolete
i think you're kidding me
no
i mean 100000
thats like 20000 pounds
50 tons is a lot of tons
keenan
the most jessica ever did was take some pictures and lift up a car
and used it as a weapon
ripped out a random pipe
luke cage punched a hole in the wall
dude
even mr.
incredible was shown lifting train cars as weights
did they never show jessica doing anything cool
then why
and im sure luke cage could "fly" by jumping just like jessica if he tried
im pretty sure the strongest thing she did was pick up a car
jessica never did anything that strong in her show
according to his origin story he got super strength and unbreakable skin
he can throw couches or rip car doors off and clean up giant building rubble
it seems like he does
whats so special about jessica jones's strength if luke cage has the same strength but also has unbreakable skin
answer my question about luke cage
keenan
MacCookie69
?
But seriously how isn't luke cage just a better version of Jessica Jones
He's bald
Fuck you're right
what separates him from jessica jones's super strength
and he picked up a couch and swung it around
but he literally just punched a hole in a wall and and ripped out a pipe to use as a weapon
like i know he unbreakable skin and shit
how is luke cage so strong
Ye
hey guys lets play dota tonight
practically
even have the same name
literally
because jesse eisenberg is literally zuckerberg
yeah i think he did a good job at showing what if zuckerberg was a supervillian
because thats literally not how batman v superman showed him
frank underwood?
thats lex luther?
yah
like is lex luther supposed to be how eisenberg portrays him
but does eisenberg even fit that role
i dont know what type of guy lex luther is aside from what i saw in batman v superman
so they say eisenberg is "doing it for charity" at the comedy attic
so they needed to stage it
like what if lex luther was giving a comedy performance
they are filming justice league
when he's here
what if
well hes doing it for charity
why is that yikes
or had some scandal that people hated him for
i thought he was really anti-gay or something
yeah someone was telling me the other day that she saw him at the farmers market but he didnt want to attract attention to himself by taking a picture with her
and why is he matching donations to bloomington's middle way house
like i know he's here right now but why
btw what is jesse eisenberg's association with bloomington
i still ahvent got around to watching those tim burton movies
i dont know how i feel about spooky things
the worst is when i dream about forgetting about an assignment
yeah thats me
you'll just make fun of me for my nightmares
your nightmares are different than mine then
your idea of horror is very different than mine
yeah
oh boy i cant wait]
i feel like there's a good chance i would be amused as well
what kind of "worst" are we talking about here
tomorrow right
on the other hand i kind of wish I was there so I could have the chance to explain myself
I think you guys had a solid conversation but I think I won because I just got 10 hours of sleep on a weekday and you didn't
Now I want to know what was deleted
i have to go to bed ive had a really long day
i will tomorrow for sure
Batman meets mario https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=OPzrMbsTmsQ&feature=share
Oh boy new battle pass.
Better get back into dota
http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/5/13175000/samsung-galaxy-note-7-fire-replacement-plane-battery-southwest <@127535721857679362>
oh i thought you were talking about a real person at first and i was really confused
<@!155893986605793281> found you another spook tune https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lfx5c3yuJH0&list=PLhHcMbVmbwCerhZdxVr4odQY_ZgLXEjET&index=25
in case anyone was wondering what the answer was to this very practical problem, it's 1/4 (n-1)
There are n crows in a line on a wire.
Each crow independently has probability 1/2 to
be facing right and probability 1/2 to facing left.
Thus, some pairs of adjacent crows
might be facing each other, some might be facing away from one another, and some
might be facing the same direction (so one is looking at the back of the other).
Let Z
be the number of pairs of adjacent crows which are facing each other.
Find the expected value of Z.
....
ah yes probability is so useful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_2234821147&feature=iv&src_vid=YGZO6T2zKPY&v=j0Ftjz2fw7w
this dota 2 sound track is making me really nostalgic by the way
<@!127535721857679362> im interested but i dont have time disucss anything until later tonight or thursday
up to 207 videos
i'll do that after skyrim
ok
yeah idk who that is
are there any other assassins creed games with notable music other than 2
some great shit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7Ut7Cx_Wrs i remember when we listened to this in the car
the only real spooktune is the one i just posted
because none of asher's spooktunes are spooky enough
also asher you left out the only true spooktune https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jaDeoFKERM
k man
instead you find something else interesting such as bastion
it was an obvious reference so why would i comment on it
but i did
i feel like someone who listens to vgm soundtracks as much as me would definitely get that reference
because it also looks like the bastion bird
yeah im pretty sure i did get the joke
bastion irl
lol yeah i watched it
and then i realized the video title was "how to draw breasts" not "how to draw beasts"
i was going to say that thumbnail looks like a nipple
<:onepunch:230136244112326656>
didnt you legit cry with
no
i really want to be the guy in the rayman band that plays the kazoo
no prob
i can probably do it too
and be able to make it past world 2 on super mario world
by the end we will be master platformers
its ok keenan will put us through rigorous training
i can lend you bowser and then in 4 years forget that i did and buy another copy when i get nostalgic again
you should play bowser when one of us is done with it
thats probably because everyone buys the good ones
aka overwawtch
doctor simulator 2016
we should play that game this weekend
just because im the best mercy player you've ever seen doesnt mean i hacked the system in order to get around aiming
no hate
yo
wow
how religious do you think mercy is
<:slut:230132043986501642>
"where's your diversity"
i want to see a game that gets criticized for not having enough white males
how come every guy that isnt white is problematic
cant get more problematic than that
and american
he's white
what about mcree
uh huh
what was he before?
but only since the summer games
ANSWER THAT
HUH?
huh?
is he jamacian or brazillian keenan
all these other characters are great an all
or people will start forgetting that mercy is actually german
we cant let this swiss thing stay in the game for too long
oh good im glad you have me covered
thats pretty problematic
did you discuss the fact that mercy lives in switzerland but has a german name
this is interesting
because pharah is mercy's bitch
which i dont
or it means i have problems fighting it
shes like the weakest one
also by the way who the fuck thinks pharah is a problematic characger
you should havae told her that you know a mercy irl
i love how all the overwatch voice lines are just memes
.1
?
.
really
ever
did you even beat it
i thought you had it on ps4
rayman legends
keenan you know what we need to play
dont forget to delete the META_INF folder when you open the jar file
check nexus
there;s  probably a mod for it
wtf there's a fucking kazoo
this is like the best 1 min song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1c1GeHjJeI&list=PLhHcMbVmbwCcKVYrt4CAogBa9J3NfKEg9&index=6
anytime
np
opposite of light-weight
and the real real hipsters will use paint.net like me becuase gimp and photoshop are too heavy of programs
photoshop is pretty nice, you can use the eraser tool to erase stuff and it's basically like having white-out or something
i write them in google docs but since it doesnt have a very good spell checker i then transfer them to photoshop for the final editing
like im always doing photoshop instead of writing a paper
i actually like the colorful default theme for each office program better but i wanted to trick people into thinking im using some fancy software instead of plain old word
so i figured i'd take advantage of it
it's a new feature in 2016
doesn't even look like office
literally everything


so i changed my microsoft office suite theme to black and it changes everything
so many trumpets
bravely default reminds me of hoenn
l
dont worry i pro
rayman legends, last of us, assassin's creed
i thought rayman was really hard
so if nothinng is in stock at gw, our options are kirby's epic yarn barn,  rayman legegnds, mk8, galazy 2 (which isn't real coop)
the rest aren't in stock at gameworld
epic yarn
that and kirby
that we already have
the only co-op game on our list is rayman legends
no tropical freeze 😦
no 3d world though 😦
Oh shit you're in luck there are exactly 5 copies
let's see
maybe there's a website
hmm i dont know
is it even in stock
can i just assume it's a perfect beautiful flower
<:sadboy:230133848740986891>
😭
😰
😢
😦
😃
btw have you been getting gw suggestions?
i kept getting that ad about the frat movie
although if asher is going to be there it's better to do a 3-way co-op game
if you cant get 3d world you could also try getting tropical freeze
i can bring a controll
do you want to play 3d world or no
<@!125452744440938497> yo can you finish episodes 1-10 of <:onepunch:230136244112326656> by friday?
also i played 3d world breifly with my brother this weekend and i forgot how good the co-op for that was
if we dont do it this weekend i'll watch it myself
<:happyboy:230130509630406656>
<:onepunch:230136244112326656> ?
<:onepunch:230136244112326656> ?
yes
<:onepunch:230136244112326656>
morning or late afternoon
also what about the gameworld meeting
keenan are we meeting friday or saturday night
https://youtu.be/XGFQOZ_owtc
ever since the technolog was there
my dog has one
Ronald the next Samsung phone will be 100-200 dollars more than thr pixel still and it will probably explode
I think it's a good phone by itself but not good as just an upgrade to the 6p
Also in the past nexus phones have always been 500 or less.
This one is 650
I don't think the pixel is a worthy upgrade from the 6p
also this reminds me of that one meme https://youtu.be/Rykmwn0SMWU
https://youtu.be/lZB2s3-Q15s
did you see the silicon valley intro
also how come every indie game with pixel graphics has a good soundtrack
another 10% is donkey kong
it's like a mix of phantom hourglass and spirit tracks but with lyrics
lol asher like 10% of my playlist is now Nier gestalt and nier replicant
the only thing emotional about that trailer was the awesome new music
you should find it
do you still have that video of yourself when theey announced mega blastoise keenan
damn i thought all the box pokemon where just in prison
calm down ive only just started the video
new trailer music
holy shit new music
which is the goal here
i dont know if i can listen to every game ost ever by myself
😦
im blazing through all these soundtracks like theyre each only an hour long or something
also keenan why arent you putting in any leg work for this playlist
but basically
not quite literally
thats basically dark souls then
i dont know if you're joking or not but i inferred from only the music
keenan is this nier game basically dark souls
cool
this nier gestalt and replicant is amazing thanks asher
https://youtu.be/kPZz6oJi8yE
almost done with splatoon
good ideas
this is rock and roll.
im just going to listen to splatoon until you give mme something
i need new ost
and why does its soundtrack sound like the movies
what was this game
how is this knights of the old republich 2 ost different from a movie ost
keenan is breathe of the wild going to be shadow of the colossus
ok need new ost
arent there multiple games
which one
what game should i expand
keenan i need a new ost to listen to
i dont know of online places but there is a local business in bloomington that sells stuff like that
like online?
too bad i dont live in canada or i could have ordered a free glass
https://www.themilkglass.ca/#home
because they only cover hell's kitchen
but that means daredevil and jessica jones cant ever help him
i didnt realize it takes place in harlem instead of hell's kitchen
just one
well it reminded me
oh
does it remind you too
what
this reminds me that i should watch luke cage
or maybe dangers of not muting it
dangers of muting discord
damn i sure missed a lot
<@127535721857679362> i heard that it closed Saturday so i submitted everything Friday
so it turns out my copy of 3d world is digital
No
Morphling intelligence gain reduced from 1.5 to 1.1
<@155893986605793281>   Im going home for a bit today, do you want me to pick up 3d world?
We can possibly beat it next weekend after we finish one punch
i really want to watch you play fallout but im going to play bowser and go to bed
ronald stop trying to hack me
when do i get to be considered an official gameworld employee
http://webtest.gameworldindiana.com/#/
actually lets test out my meta tags
webtest.gameworldindiana.com
keenan it's not worth doing actual research for ronald
you just say no
at least im trying to answer the question
keenan stop saying no
but extra controllers are just wii controllers
it would come with the pad controller
150
idk probably 100
like 50
people on reddit will pick out all your parts for free
companies already do that
it could happen to anyone
i was trtying to generalize my problem jesus
the most annoying thing i face is that my roommate doesnt wash his dishes
yeah and us three will be speaking in terms you dont understand
because by that time we'll be speaking in an entirely different language
ronald in a few more months you will be so distant from us because you dont read the chat that we wont even be friends anymore
it's the exception
that was the one and only serious discussion we pinned
not the serious discussions
no we only pin the memes
you have to sort through the crap to geed to the good stuff
ronald do you know that sometimes i tell you secrets just because i know you'll never actually read them
ronald do you realize how many important things you'll never know about because you dont read it
i wonder if it has my favorite character
ok
is that an x-man
i dont think ive ever been more bored in my life
good times
guys remember when i said i was going to play bowser and go to bed 2 hours ago
i have to start watching these
shit netflix really does have a lot of good documentaries though
it's smart for them to focus on original shows so they dont have to compete with all the other streaming sites
netflix's catalog is becoming worse and worse
but dont you agree lost is a relatively scary show
lost
like i wouldn't ever watch lost at night
not that i would really know but i thought it got scary sometimes
some parts of lost got pretty close to being a horror show
and dont really care to
horror is the only genre i havent really explored
damnit
is it scary
ronald did you ever watch more of stranger things
yeah i know asher
its proabbyl just breaking bad
also apparently the netflix original Narcos is good too
i actually watch a lot of dark shows
for luke cage
im so hyped actually
it wont go for free until next year i thnk
you have to buy it though
since its not on amazon yet
after i finished the first season i didnt have the motivation to try and find the 2nd one for free online
are you going to watch luke cage
wasnt that on im going to hell for this ronald
i forgot why you did it
i blame you
why did i not know this
it did
shit
did luke cage just come out
waaait
shit this is danger territory now
oh fuck thats right you guys turn 21 this cycle
2.5 hours
its not far
ya which is a train
they have a fucking train
it's a really weird store
i was just there
they have a really good brand of it at trader joes
i also like mango orange juice
mine too
I haven't been there in a while.but i when i was young i remember thinking it was a neat stlre
That you can't get anywhere else in Bloomington
I thought they do have some niche/unique products though
Nice Ronald way to change the subject I'm trying to discover your secret here
Hmm
Cholicoal
Ocholical
Cholicalo
You just need one more o
But did everyone else know
Did you know cholical is almost an anagram of alcoholic
Thanks
Sounds brilliant
That's not the reason it's stupid
Lol
Do you think I'm concerned about the job interviews at tech companies
*the stupid boys
You guys are all stupid
<:ronald:230126993008623616>

im going to do something really dangeroud

i dont think i can do this weekend but probably next
you're lucky i fell asleep after the two sea king episodes otherwise i would have jsut finished it all
y
There are so many feels in this show
You would if you read chat history ever
Mumen rider is who we all aspire to be

This episode is amazing.

at this rate, this playlist is going to be majority donkey kong music if i keep adding songs from tropical freeze.
i havenet even gotten to any other donkey kong game yet
this also good
dont even know what this game is but it's going on the playlist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQuJZsBCuGA&list=PLvNp0Boas723wfsMDJjkwanwllj39NBNu&index=21
<:ronald:230126993008623616>
too bad thats the only video of it 😦
this is like the best undertale related fan content ive seen
this is actaully really cool
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aUARXevQCo
these tetis lyrics dont even make sense
something thats just a good song in general
modern games with lyrics use them to say something else beyond the store or not really related to it at all like the bastion stuff
i think because they are trying to describe the story or whats happening with the lyrics when there's no need to since that stuff is already obvious from the gameplay
if you opened red and the start up screen was the pokemon rap
well yeah but theoretically
it would be awesome still but weird
can you imagine if the pokemon rap or the pokemon theme song was first introduced in one of the games instead of the anime
i think these examples demonstrate why video game music typically doesnt have lyrics
i dont have time for any of the videos weve been listening to
i know
i dont have time for this shit
wtf
or if the only lyrics are pepsi man
i tend to prefer instrumental stuff
it's okay
ive just never listend to pink floyd directly i think
its good too
ive actually heard a lot of led zepplin and some other bands because of my dads music tastes
he knew all about rock and roll
this is not what asian kayboard man played
is this...
rock and roll?
this is good
i feel like the bastion composers were inspired by led zepplin
ya
i cant have a test and math homework due
i even own this game already
fuck you
damnit keenan i need to play faster than light now
why does gameworld need so many playlists
why exactly
i feel like i can devote an entire weekend to do this
yeah ive wasted an hour now listening to shit
but im pretty sure ronald wont know what it's from
its pretty good



but i want you to use it too
is it ok if i add piano covers and the originals for some of this bastion music
here's the song that bastion won like 3 awards for https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cELTdtw6U
this is just the master list if we're really motivated we can divide it up into parts later
lol thats fine there's supposed to be variety
then he'll be all up to date on the good video game music besides fallout
we should send this playlist to ronald to listen to while he drives here
it's weird but actually pretty good
lol
fortunately for a lot of these games if they are indie games or just not nintendo games where they put half the budget on music,  their soundtracks are not that long
damn if we want this to truly be extensive there will be a lot of "work" to do
oh yeh same with shovel knight
there's definitely more i can add from there
oh thanks for reminding me of the bastion soundtrack
can we have a separate playlist for the lols
this sounds like the one punch man music kind of
its probably ok to have multiple versions of the same song if that song's good
can i see
im just going to add both
just it will be a lot different from most of the other stuff
not like it's bad
i just think the originals especially from the nes era have a really distinct feel
i understand
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuFP76k8EoU
shit
i didnt play other non-nintendo games and im only exposed to their soundtracks through pandora and google music
i just grew up with this stuff
not like they are bad thouhg
and through the entirety of pokemon music
oh shit i cant wait until i go through the whole smash bros library
probably because it is
this sounds like that meme song
lol well it's good to make sure we are on the same page if this is the master list of all playlists
unless it's a particularly good version of star theme
like star theme
oh yeah another guideline that is probably a give but dont add shit like soundeffects that is less than 1 minute
yeah i used to listen to it a lot back when i used pandora
good idea
oh shit silent hill is great
but they wont always exist which is ok
but for older games i think we should try to find non-midi versions if poossible
and not just midi
the thing i like most about modern games on newer consoles is that their soundtracks are almost always real recordings anyway
if there are better renditions out there than the original
i mean this holds true for that stuff too
like in my opinion if an orchestrated version exists that takes priority
if it's classic zelda music for example, we should try to find the orchestrated versions and add that
oh ok
like what
you sohuld go through and listen to everything again so that way we only add the best stuff
also dont just add whats on your computer as a playlist already
im just adding the best stuff from every vgm soundtrack im listening to that day
did you read my guidelines?
you should work on the playlist when you have spare time
cool
?
uhhuh
whats your issue boy
but with only the best of the best
oh yeah my goal for this is to have a library so expansive you can just put it on shuffle and it will be like a radio
?
im definitely going to add som assassins creed stuff, some final fantasy, castlevania, age of mythology, kingdom hearts, halo, and starraft stuff
just currently for me ive only been listening to nintendo music lately
so maybe that was an overestimate
i mean half of the songs on my normal playlist aren't nintendo
k
keenan you need to add yourself as a collaborator with the invite link
if you add silvagunner im removing you
about what
probably 70% nintendo
because thats naturally how it will end up
also in my opinion it's okay if there is an uneven representation of games/publishers
no silvagunner pls
because at the end i can go through, duplicate the playlist, and create a personal version
i was just about to say that you should also add stuff that i might not necessarily like
i know
try to add stuff that you think we both would like
cool
and i'll do it with eventually most games
im going to go back through and listen to the whole mk8 soundtrack again and add the best stuff from there
like currently it's all dk tropical freeze but thats just because it's what im listening to right now
but add songs to this that are things you would share in discord
i still need to go through and add all the obvious stuff
start adding shit to this
keenan https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP-PZmHUrkrH-1SQjNbrlXSZSdkTOvKte&jct=feaxV6QZCuu79lcIavtS1EISwe97mQ
keenan tropical freeze soundtrack is really soothing
i just liek the artwork they put throughout the book
those books are surprisingly useful in multiple ways
i think i still have my emerald book
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJsZnsAp_94&index=2&list=PLvNp0Boas723wfsMDJjkwanwllj39NBNu&shuffle=182
miecraft
i was old enough to remember but i just didnt really play it or have friends that did
like i dont really remember when the ps2 wasnt retro
you started gaming at an earlier age than me
its already weird thinking of the gameboy sp as retro because i grew up with it
ugh its going to be so weird for me to imagine when like the ps4 and wii u are retro consoles
50 years later
with my wii u
i'll have the most fun room at the nursing home
but by the time we're unemployed we will have a new list
unless we're unemployed
yeah because afterwards in real life there will be no more time
so
i got stuck on dkcr
i dont think tropical freeze is that short of a game
like 2d ones
im pretty bad at platforming
i dont know about that
i have 8 and 3d world
it's like im stealing
and i have to stop listening to soundtracks without playing the game
the thing all these games have in common is a good soundtrack
and the handheld games dont count because those can be played continuously
this is like 6 hours of rigorous training once a week if we want to get through this list
its ok by the time you get here over new years we will still only be on like galaxy 2

it still is basically math now
back then philosophy was basically math
and everything else he did in math
and the cartesian product
except for you know the cartesian plane
because without philosophers guild i wouldnt have recognized the cart man
i feel like philosophers guild really prepped me for cognitive science
this man likes to meditate
you probably dont know him

ya
i giant stardew valley update just came out and i dont have time to play it <:sadboy:230133848740986891>
i can hype
he actually explains the detials
it is much more technical
what do you mean simplifying things down
ronald closing discord kills everyone inside but muting it only puts them to sleep
https://youtu.be/UXrB7Y6gVN8
also guys sorry for muting you earlier, sometimes dramatic measures must be taken in times of crisis
ronald sometime do you think you could tell me how to do that
red on blue is bad
i did turn of notifications
shh
guys be quiet
i thought female mac was <:slut:230132043986501642>

<:sadboy:230133848740986891>
but if you are along it really lets you focus on it
only if the narrator is bad
but what do I know driving and sitting in a car are two different things
i think audio books would be more engaging if you are alone
or listen to every super mario star melody
or you could listen to a whole book
like ronald could re-watch psych because he doesnt actually need to see the screen to know what happening since he's seen it enouhg
it gives you a chance to do all kinds of things that you normally dont have time for though thats the point
it would give you a chance to listen to like 8 podcasts
i dont think it would be that bad
Game
Or move to another mario kart came
Then you just repeat it
I'm so hyped to do that when I finally drive on my own long distance trip
Just play mario kart music while you drive
reprise https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-xjejirRi8&index=77&list=PLz5gUls4mkX-AM61S5BeBt_UaxPvXF4iZ
<:slut:230132043986501642>
because he did the test in 20 minutes
and are driving and sitting in the car two different things?
but Im so focused on applying to more complex principles that I forget about where they come from and how the basics work
Like I learn new basic things about html/css all the time that I would have learned early on if I didn't teach myself them
Ronald you're probably going to miss something trivial and basic that they taught but you didnt bother to learn because you already know the more advanced stuff.
lol what if you fail

?
when would our meeting with ron be then
next time i come over remind me to bring it
it will encourage me to beat the game
actually i should listen to that soundtrack
and it's real co-op
thats actually a really good game too
i also need to beat 3d world
i still probably suck now just havent played it recently
but that was back when i sucked
i got to the fifth world before it got too hard
ah yes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqTKdBe9UQg&list=PLC583980D7806298E&index=69

im going to listen to the mario galaxy soundtrack
the super mario 64 ds ones are cool because theres a variant for each power up

the expert on composing star melodies
dan the star melody guy
they probably have a guy
why do they keep creating new ones every time
like wtf
i cant believe there is 30 minutes of different star melodies

i like the super mario world ones
this is actually kidn of cool

what about nice mode monseiur
but baroque monseiur exists
keenan that's a life crisis i have to re-evaluate every 5 minutes
where are the sites that it's not too modern for
most
whats one site that uses them
really
unless they are more like tooltips
i personally think popups are dated
even twitter doesnt and they invented it
i dont think there are any sites that even use modal popups anymore
why not just implement it as routes instead of modal popups
that seems kind of useless to me
do you really need urls for the profile pages

if you have access to the the current site you can probably just remove that set interval and nothing will break
trying to set the height of the shitty embded calendar every second
look at that setInterval
``` 

        function updateHeight() {

            var contentHeight = Math.max(

                el.scrollHeight,
                el.offsetHeight
            ) + 200; // Need to figure out a better way to handle this
            // Large lists jump back and forth between two different heights

        }
        
        setInterval(updateHeight, 1000);
        
        updateHeight();
    ```
``` found the error ```
the error is because of their shit embed calendar
lol
ronald how much do you have to think in carolina think
it doesnt look liek wordpress
or something
probably drupal
ah
why
i dont like the embeded hypestarted calender]
this current site isn't bad
and even if you look at the images your image is just blue
ronald i mean the colors of the site fonts and layouts not the colors of the images
in my opinion
there should be more than two colors
i also think there's only 2 colors on this site
i think "Think Team" should go over the banner image
i hope this is the exact final layout
only a couple people said yes but im pretty sure everyone knew what it was they just thought it was too dumb a question to reply
lol my AI instructor just asked a class of mostly computer science students if anyone knew what the game Portal was or if it was too old for you
they actually have a dedicated bike lane for that sidewalke but its not mark clearly enough and no one respects it
So were you
Also Keenan walking and biking on the sidewalk are two different things.
Especially if you only bike on one side.
I saw him
It is known as the greatest track cover up in history
And framed it as an airplane
Within seconds of the disaster they immediately tore down the remaining roller coaster tracks so the public wouldn't know how slow the government was to notice the tracks for decades leading up to it
That's how it really happened

just like this theme https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W_bFLwB0WY
this just fits the game so amazingly well
maybe its to handle the hype
i dont know why i like this song so much
ive listened to this video so many times and i cry everytime https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo5iGNV6GRM
like zelda music
i usually prefer when stuff has real endings instead of fade outs
thats kind of pointless when you have youtube
have a lot of hours on it
idk i think it's a good game
and the violin

ok
nah
play what
https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/54g3xe/minecon_111_changelog_and_news/
they are adding llamas and backpacks to minecraft
i hope you just changed it to that for this purpose
i dont want to mess anything up
is it a limited number of devices or concurrent streams
yeah
keenan can i watch one punch man
we can go back to my pro writing
makes sense
but i mean if you put both  cards in a computer
so then you have 2 sd cards with all the games
but what prevents you make having a second sd card and just copying the stuff exactly
i see
i thoguht you couldnt simply just copy games like that
pretending you have a new wii you are transferring to
you're just doing a transfer then
wat
but at least the website will still be secure
but what if it's hacked
actually nvm i have plan
yes but if you had acces to that computer you would have access to the files of the site
its ftp stuff
its not godaddy stuff
not like the administrative godaddy account
just the files of the site
because someone with acces to the username and password can upload/modify anything on the site
i can take it out the file and make it more secure by requiring him to type it in
so you dont have to type the password each time you want to update the stock
well currently i have a more secure password but it's stored in plaintext in a config file
or is that the only thing he can remember
can it be more secure than that and also something ron would rmember
what would be a good password to protect the script uploader
keenan
probably because its not a jrpg
why does eat your potatoes have so many dislikes
i think it will be a while until the request goes through
lets make this entire radio age of mythology
i put in another aom request
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwWh1xy6gvU
no i dont request anything it's final fantasy for me
it sucked
this warcraft II song has all dislikes
which is also random
i dont think you have the concept of shuffling
literally half of their library is final fantasy
oh i dont even know where that is
not necessarily since i can bike there
i can also do fridays after 3
put the script up, and transfer the site to the main domain
ok then this weekend we can have a meeting where i do everything all at once
do you have a wifi connection i can connect my laptop to at the store
i'll want to run tests and stuff at the store
well let me see
i dont really know right now because i think i'll have to modify the script when the site is on the actual server and depending of if you guys added anything new new i should exclude to the latest stock
yeah sure
when would be best
what thing
so i dont have anything to do until next weekend
and placeholder content replaced
when will i have feedback on site
which one
&#63;
U+003F

fuck you
driving and sitting a car are two different things but we dont have a rule about the differences between driving and riding in one
i think i finally understand everything
also are we going to play game tonight
keenan did you show the site to anyone else
but it's a feature under consideration with "low priority" apparently
tons of websites use it and they all just look bad in ie
lol ie not supporting css blending is apparently a big deal
dont know if it works on mobile
a sketch js demo
i want this https://codepen.io/soulwire/full/foktm
here's what it looks like without background blending because microsoft is dumb
but i realized the search works perfectly fine in edge and IE but there's a new feature i added called "the X" which clears the search field.
turns out IE and edge have their own little "X" that clears the search field so i was clicking that instead of my own and it wasnt doing what a programmed.
but my own still exists and works
it still doesnt support my background blending
ok edge is literally IE but faster
you can uninstall all built in windows 10 apps i just forgot how to do it
ok i cant even figure out how to uninstall edge
i think im going to try reinstalling it
my computer is having trouble opening edge
in a couple more years it will be completely dead
ever since everyone was forced to get windows 10, i think less people should be using IE anyway since mincrosoft recommends edge now
do you guys use IE in your store?
but it's still useable i think
the search works but it's slower on IE.
also some of the styling relating to background images is off
but it's not optimal
because technically we support it
how important is IE support
a pop up ad
what do you want to happen
when we exit beta
i need to go into the store for that
I cant believe IE doesn't support my background blending properties
also it works on IE now but still some weird bugs
maybe the author should be something else
which is why it says my name
lol discord is reading my authoer meta tag
http://webtest.gameworldindiana.com/
and i uploaded pretty much my entire development environment when i only really need 6 files from it
i just remembered that im an idiot and dont know how to deploy angular 2 apps
Soon (tm)
no it will be webtest.gameworldindiana.com
i also think there are some informational sections of the home page that need more content
alright
like should i be uploading to the gameworld dev domain with lost soul boy
keenan when are we going to fix all the placeholder stuff
and also /r/latestagecapitalism which is the only place that ridiculed the video but is equally on the extreme end
that video was posted on /r/conservative and /r/the_donald




i mean you can still view it with the direct link
R.6d too general
im pretty sure your post got deleted
Mac driving and sitting in a car are two different things.
Especially if you only ride backseat

im about to put a new version up on gameworlds domain
I don't even think i fully understand this fresh new meme
Sitting Mac and different in a ride are driving especially backseat.
Two if you only car things.
Mac sitting and different in a ride are backseat driving especially.
Two if you only backseat things.
Mac driving and sitting in a car are two different things.
Especially if you only ride backseat
Mac driving and sitting in a car are two different things.
Especially if you only ride backseat
but i also have the added bonus of experiencing a large part of the other factor by simply being a passanger in the car
i have to worry about cars passing me just as much as cars have to worry about it
ronald, if you dont bike, you wont understand why you simply cant go on the sidewalk.
if i dont drive, i can still understand what its like being a car alongside the road with a bike because i am one of the two factors there
it only goes one way
you cant make the counter assumption
you dont have to actually drive to know what it's like driving alongside bikes
car has more than one person in it
a bike is a one person vehicle you have to be on it
yes i can
but dont need to actually be driving the car to understand what it's like driving a car with bikers on the road
and will accept the fact they have to go on roads
gernally people other than you will agree that there's no better place to go if you're a biker
if you've ever ridden a bike you would understand
its not
most bikers will agree riding on the sidewalk is a lot more dangerous than riding on the road
or there's a curb
actually you cant if you have a road bike
and generally people trying to walk think your an asshole if you go on the sidewalk when theres not a lot of room
and they walk in groups
also people walk on the sidewalk arent always single file
its not all about the speed of the collision ronald
if you are on the road you endanger just yourself
if you ride on the sidewalk you are endangering both yourself and the pedestrians
not on campus
because people walk on the side walk
sidewalks are not designed for bikes either
any time
its ok to run stop signs if no cars are there though
i dont agree with bikers running red lights
the problem isnt bikers its the lack of bike lanes
but theres nothing else they can do
its also not legal to run it indirectly
because jaywalking is literally just running a redlight
why not just run the red light
why would they even have to go to the sidewalk
how is that different from jaywalking pedestrians
put on document
also ask what final changes
like i told you
the server
i have no idea what you're saying
i dont understand how they are getting past a red light if it's a 4 wy intersection
it still has to be green to cross the side walk
how would you even do that
also who the fuck puts spaces in folder names omg
also people who think roads are meant for cars are assholes
then where do bikes go
i would look like an asshole if i tried to pass a car going really slow on my bike
im pretty sure theres some double standards here
they're annoying because they slow down traffic but if they are going faster than traffic why do cars still need to pass
i wonder if i can make them get a ticket by forcing them to go 10 mph over if they want to pass
i dont understand why cars still feel the need to pass me on my bike when im going 5-7 miles over the speed limit already
lol
its his own damn fault he was sleeping
you're going to be way ahead of me, im only at the third save point
after i play through this i might go back and play saga while i wait for dream team to become cheap
and suck everything
its ok you can still play as bowser
lol
i know they have but i want it in just normal mario games
i wish they gave mario voice acting like he has in every mario game
and dialogue
the characters are so good in that game
apology accepted.
next time be more considerate
im at school

intro to probability theory i
m463
andy maben is in my class maybe i should ask him
thats almost a probability
n = 10, p= 0.6
Given that you make exactly 6 of the 10 shots, what is the probability that you
make at least 3 of the last 5 shots?
you should do my probability homework for me so i can work on the gameworld site
yeah pretty soon words will be the next cool thing

keenan are you ok
i miss the old ronald, the used to play games ronald, the didnt make keenan cry ronald
💦
why not
what
No ideally i would tap into a  Google/Amazon/wikipedia API to calculate that since they already have it worked out
I can probably make it subtract just a little bit so stuff is ranked better without sending it below the threshold
so i just chose what i thought to be best for most titles
there's no way to handle that on a case by case basis because obviously how i should handle it varies on the game
if you search "mario" you likely want any game with mario in it, and a lot of mario games can have very long titles that are still mario games but all those matching terms would cause the relevance score to go below the threshold
theres a reason for that
additional non matching terms wont subtract from it
because my relevance score is all additive
i know why thats happening
roanld i know
i can easily add that but there was a reason why i didnt i think
it is a closer match
or i would have to go through every game title and determine that
they would have to specify in their descriptions whats dlc
gameworld doesnt provide me with any info about the game other than a title oand/or description
Isn't that fallout dlc
im going to go to bed but when i wake up there better be shit for me to do
keenann please add to my list
i'll work on it
zoldo would be another 5 hours of work
sorry only tested for zeldo
add to my list yo
please add stuff here
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r4q42IFwUbDKDhkQ1KWvIe71DFhIzMllVMKFgxIpewY/edit?usp=sharing
yeah it does
definitely needs some gui fixes
yeah this is the first time im seeing it on mobile
http://silo.cs.indiana.edu:33134/gameworld/gw-main/
yeah possibly
dont qeustion mark lol
sorry but you're not my type, since python doesnt have type declarations
he thinks dkc is not that challenging
np
which is how long it took me for half of world one
if you didnt know he can beat super meat boy in 20 minutes or something
keenan is way better at platformers than the average person
instead of the obscure one "snes"
thank you for using the proper abbreviation
i wont but you can listen to his theme at least
one of the reasons people liked this game so much
fawful is such an amazing villan
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EH6U242mC0&list=PL0F1CC7E40779F15F&index=10
and it wasnt the duck song
i forgot what it was
ronald once sent me a song that he liked so much he listened to it on repeat for like 3 days
no i really like philip glass i just  dont know if it's ideal for overwatch
but some times you have to be soothed for overwatch as well
i dont know why thats in there
yah this is my overwatch playlist
just click the link
this version is a remix but the original is also very good
here's my favorite spooky video game song https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAuqowo5vA4&list=PLP-PZmHUrkrHW0r3Lq0pFEH18RJoBVb6p&index=4
oh by the way keenan
what are you talking about
after i finish the website i have another three websites to make
except my pace will be really slow since i have no time
you should start it, we can play through at same pace
it's a brilliant game
like the good old days when we used to play fallout together
ok but this way we can play it together
then i lost it
did i get it back
did i lend it to you
but i opened the title screen and remembered how good the music was
it just came today and i really want to play it again but im refraining myself
so a couple days ago i had a really nice dream about playing bowsers inside story but i lost the game like 4 years ago and couldnt play it, so i bought it on ebay 5 minutes after i woke up
so happy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDMPKHRze30&index=48&list=PL2XjmdkuVL-04v0wkzgB5vxpyI1Rcv_Dw&shuffle=2502
where every song is good
this reminds me of that
i sometimes put the smash 4 playlist of like 300 songs on shuffle and repeat
then i guess i dont like the genre
it is very repeatitive
not kind of
id consider it kind of repeatitive
i really like mount wario https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1fZFQrxgdc&index=15&list=PL2XjmdkuVL-04v0wkzgB5vxpyI1Rcv_Dw
look at that bitch

ok keenan im trying out this url thing btw and i dont know if like it
oh thats another one i still need to watch
i still dont think he ever read that conversation
while at a meeting
ever since he kept discord open while you guys where talking about your new found brotherhood
which is honestly probably what scared ronald away
i cant even check it on my phone during school or something because half of the time it's all porn
like he'll probably never read this message
he only reads stuff in the moment
i understand why ronald probably never reads chat history
i still havent watched the shit keenan sent monday morning
guys how am i supposed to have time for all these links
no i have to go back and actually listen ot them
because i never actually opened the videos
i just realized that earlier you were linking to the parody gilvasunner and not the real one
lol that clip is more interesting than the real version
but no literally all it is are those 30 second clips
which i would be fine with if there was like a full soundtrack you could listen to
the rest is like 30 sec sound bites that are meant for ambient noise or map intro
literally the only real song overwatch has is the theme which is also the potg music
this reminds me how much i find overwatch lazy on the music side.
mario kart has unique songs for each track and they have 32 courses.
overwatch barely has 30 second intro clips for each of their 13 courses
i will too
but ive noticed while playing
ive never listened to it
_except the one true ronald_
bick dick lanm is the actual nickname of a dota player
"Nicknames are visiable to everyone on the server.
Do not change them unless you are enforcing a naming system or removing bad nickname" finally we are using the nickname system for it's intended purpose
or the ronald ronald
better than the mac ronald
at least we still have big dick daddy ronald
because we're annoying ronald
the just went offline ronald
the responds to your messages ronald
the not volatile ronald
i miss the old ronald
goddamnit i guess he's the just went offline ronald now
i just learned something truly amazing
ronald
no the server hasnt been up for a while
oh ok did you take your card off
?
except for the part where you can look at my sidebar icon
and asher sees: "Mac, Mac and Mac are typing..."

for posterity
you should just make a playlist for us
although to be honest a subscription to that type of channel isnt very useful
Ever since music theory in highschool where Keenan and I did a video game music project
I've been subscribed to that channel for a long time
omg its so beautiful
i dont know what it's about anymore
yeah but like halfway through the first season it doesnt even become about that anymore
it gets much weirder
the show really isnt about what you think it is
he only does that in like the first episode
i said that and then i was going to send a picture of what i was referring to but i guess i never did
well fuck thats ugly
😦
gg ez
you guys arent even in call yo
We literally know nothing except that it will have pokemon go HD as a launch title
I'm still amazed by how well the nx has been kept under wraps
Yeah and go hd
Keenan I called out pokemon go HD months ago
http://i.imgur.com/aJeJ2Ec.jpg
FUCKIYU
Fuck them
FUCK FUCK FUCK
LITERALLY 12 FUCKING MINUTES AFYER THE DUE DATE TGEY CHANGE THE DUE DATE
FUCK
why do all my classes have to be so fucking hard
basically we learned procrastinating on programming assignments is bad
im sure clara will tell you about our troubles asher
and i didnt submit 5% of it
assignment was due at midnight
literally took the whole time
thank you
shush
sorry that was mean
shut up
good thing my volumn is off
is it repeating stuff
whyy
learn your shit <@!155893986605793281>

<@!127535721857679362> why do you care
weird
can you not click and drag it?
there i did it for you
you should be able to add a new role of the color you want and apply it to yourself to get that color
but that shouldn't prevent you from changing my name
maybe it wont work because im the owner and have all permissions regardless of roles
idk i gave everyone full permissions
you should have permissions
hopefully this names embarass ronald when he keeps discord on for group work and interviews
thank you for representing the best of online gaming
ew
boy you aren't even a heal slut
and the remaining shit is just bonus if i can get it to work like a search loading icon
2.
add your artworkd
1.
add category filter
there are ttwo things left to do on the site
in that case there aren't any features either
there are no bugs keenan
"bug checking"
otherwise im going to go directly to a development area on this new space
i mean if he has hesitations i'll have a development preview of the site up tonight hopefully on my own space if he wants to see
i can send you another screenshot if you want
i dont think i'll have time to host something he can look at before tonight
like even if he hates it and wants a completely different one than he'll still need a hosting plan
this is something he would want to do regardless of if he uses my site or not
that you can preview
part of the hosting plan is to allow me to run a development site
so basically he can just pay 143 dollars for 3 years of hosting and after that it doubles in price i think
such as the stock of duck dynasty
and all your sensitive publically available information lost
unless you are really worried about getting hacked
dont need that shit
like site backup and restore, sitelock malware scanning, and an SSL certificate
also he might be tempted but they try to sell you tons of additional shit
unless you want more than one website for some reason
yes
but after that it will be 8/month
actually you get pay 4/month if you buy a 36 month term
they always do this sale thing where it's on sale for like a month and then when you renew it basically doubles in price
personally i dont like godaddy that much but im familiar with it and dont know what else to use at the moment
depends if he wants unlimited or 1 website
it really doesnt matter
https://www.godaddy.com/hosting/web-hosting
id get economy or deluxe
ok hold on
i think godaddy makes things pretty noob friendly stuff should be self explanatory, my only requirement is linux and cpanel
yes but it's a purchase
the scale and size capacity is up to him, depending on how much traffic he gets
get one that is on linux and has cpanel
just log on to goddaddy, and look at hostings options
i can put it on one of my server spaces tonight if i have time
also tell your boss to make a hosting account, i basically have a complete site
i'll watch these when im done with my assignment
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce5mRvkAePU
Stand in a ring
Bite your buddy's tail for lunch
What a happy looking bunch
the lyrics are actually well written
my favorite part of this is that it's official
lol me too
i know it looks like he shot  11 bullets but trust me it's only6, the last one curved a bit
theres also this https://gfycat.com/DarkPowerfulIntermediateegret
This is so satisfying for some reason
https://gfycat.com/RapidAggravatingBlowfish
Haven't decided what I'll do yet
I'd probably do some internship this summer
Yeah it's on my immediate todo list
Because i need to make one which i don't have time to do right now
I was waiting until i knew the deadline
I still haven't put a resume on there yet
I'd also be willing to just buy a ticket but I'd have to know if I'm registered first
I doubt many people will be flying there though
It means i can only fly if the flights aren't full but i won't know that until closer to the date
You just make sure it's not full and i can get on it
Actually you don't really book until the day of
I can't book flights if im flying standby until like the week before
But it also says they say when due date is getting close
But I probably will
Idk they haven't sent any further information about application due dates
or for delegating tasks you dont want on your own computer
but something like gcp or aws would also be nice for running scripts 24/7
neither do i
in google cloud you get a lot of discounts for long term usage
i think the google cloud minecraft server wasn't usage based
its only like that in the smaller plans
apache is difficult for modern frameworks
not just apache
its more flexible and i can run node servers
if i do i'd rather it be through something like google cloud platform or aws
i'll probably host a developmental version of this gameworld site there though in a couple days
i think they terminate all process like apache over the summer
i still have the server space the server is just not running at the moment
also i cant use this power mode plugin for atom on my laptop because it lags too much 😦
also half of my stuff is over ssh anyway so it's not like i need to transfer files frequently
so i can keep them consistent
i got a plugin for atom that syncs all settings and plugins
no but im going to start
and i dont feel like moving them
but all the files are here
because i should be coding on my desktop anyway
8gb
i also have 2 excel sheets open and a sass compiler and typescript compiler
and atom is running with like 12 tabes
i have four chrome windows open
83% memory usage and average of 40% cpu
like it lags when i type in discord
my laptop is under really heavy load right now and it never takes more than 3 seconds
also part of the simplicity of this site is it doesnt need a server side
anything beyond string matching is overkill
ahh great idea
and ones with both call of duty and playstation in them will be ranked the highest
so all the listings with call of duty in them will be ranked higher than the ones with playstation in them
but the category search has a lower weight
you can search for "call of duty playstation" and get games for the playstation listed first
so i just search through titles and the console it's for
because the gameworld people dont have descriptions on their stuff
the limiting factor of this search is really the fact that i can only search through game titles
like "the legend of zelda a link to the past" is only 4 terms
but it's rare for a query to be that long
yeah i dont consider it at all
keenan came to me originally and said can you make a site that is basically just a search bar
probably but considering the searching thing is literally the only function of this site
it removes the last one they typed
yea
speed also reduces drastically the more terms they enter so i cap it at 6
it's a slightly stricter cuttoff if they enter fewer terms
the exact cutoff depends on how many terms they entered
yeah i normalize the score between 0 and 1 and generally scores less than 20-50% relevance get cut off
yes
damerau-levenshtein basically measures the distance between two strings in terms of insertions, deletions, substituions, and transpositions
it breaks down by words, excludes some punctuation, excludes words i deem irrelevent like 'the' and words <= 2 letters, then applies adamerau-levenshtein distance function on them with each word in list of items and assigns a relevance score based on the value of that function
lol wtf why does it have a ps4 and xbox one game
whatever that is
plus like three different duck dynasty games
i love how i can search " asdfaksdf fuck asdf" and get donald duck for the gameboy color and some game called  buck bumble for the nintendo 64
https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-block-formatting-contexts-in-css/
it applies a block formatting context
that determine how a div holds content
because it applies some other properties besides that
the outer container is screwed because you didnt put overflow:hidden on it
it's simpler than it looks
i would spend some time looking into it if you're having trouble positioning stuff
here's what i discovered today thats really cool https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
but you're probably not doing something right so im telling you set widths manually
because it should force the div to take up remaining space
and making them both float left
thats literally all bootstrap is doing
make the image container width:66% and the desc container width 33%
fine then just set widths
actually make just the image float left, and give the description overfflow:hidden
you got to div them and float left
in bootstrap cols are divs
make them divs
i know
i dont think that matters if you are using float on both things
because divs are display blcok by devault
idk divs
idk why you are using spans but they might have to be set to display:block or inline-block
and give the parent container overflow:hidden
make them both float left
oh nvm i know what you mean
tags
just use p tages
i need to see the elements
yeah hes good
look at the fourth one
http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/
oh shit i found discord's loading icon
its totally a 90s website gif
especially looping shit
gifs on webpages violate all my principles
ive never squashed so many bugs so fast in my life
yes
but really any of them would look good
the question mark or the r
unknown looks kind of like the search symvbol
can you draw unknown
we found you a riki
like dota
pick some game that they would never buy at gameworld
you should come up with something specific to this site soonish though
im using soul boy as a placeholder for now
there's so much room for creativity here
i dont think ron will appreciate it though
yay
it makes me sad that im not good enough to have my own
i really like discords loading icon
didnt get it
as long as they aren'ta  complete dumbass
i'd actually like to think my search algorithm is pretty lenient
p.s.
it could be out of stock
or you know they could not have it in stock
its not just not found file, it's not found search item
yeah totally makes sense
i kind of want something that relates to not found that i can show when they search for something and dont find it
can you put it on the computer
yay
for not found
i need you to draw me a picture
wait

guys next time theres a rager in overwatch can we just make sounds at him
yeah thats what i thought too
either that or he voice overs after the recording
so is he just talking to himself the entire time he plays hoping for some moments
how come 100% of the things he says come true
or the dva rocket one
i like the reaper clip the best

it's such a good video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUyoOUUE4YE idk his overwatch wons are pretty great
this guy's channel is so good https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPwlfbeQOBg
there are like notoriously bad reviews from former employees left about working at that company
apparently the ceo of that company is a jackass
its made by the same people who made smite and apparently thats going to shit
and it looked absolutely terrible
i watched a review for the beta version of this game when i was still considering buying overwatch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2gBkqP4V9Y
no
he shouldve done that
thats true but he didnt mention the good indie games that already came out this year
although he said all games were shit this year but didnt mention stardew valley or overwatch at all
this guy does a great job at highlighting indie games
thank you keenan finally someone understands early access other than me
so many bugs
i need to host it first and before i do that i want to make sure the bulk of the editing is done
NO
fortunately the search should only take like 3-4 seconds max if they put in something really complicated
only to dissappoint you in the end
ive tried so hard to get it work
keenan for now there isnt going to be a loading icon while it's searching the catalog
😦 i tried to edit someone else's stack overflow answer because they spelled "length" wrong but then it said avoid trivial edits
WOO
I DID FILTERS
it doesnt suck it's just slightly outdated
i feel like there's so many nuances of css that even though i've known it for 4 or 5 years i can always discover something new
just discovered an entire featureset of css thats extremely useful but have never heard of before
WOWWWWW
then nothing will obscure the heads
i think you should try tuning it off
so good that in fact i dont even need to try to aim
but personally i cant even tell the diference since im so good at aiming
less is more which is why i removed my crosshair
i dont even need a crosshair and i could still aim
aiming doesnt take any skill and therefor crosshair style doesnt matter at all
thats not true you first played mcress 25 times on my account
how is your career average elimns only 10

pretty soon you will be obsolete  ronald
angular1 developers will fall out of demand since angular2 is so much better
i dont have time for this shit
goddamnit this guy wants me to make a plunkr
you're going to look at this and think it looks like java
do you want to upboat
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39550373/angular2-view-updates-for-some-values-but-not-others-when-subscribing-to-obser
i cant do that
oh shit someone asked me to create a plunkr
at least im not
no
my question is much harder than that
well i havent really looked at it yet but im pretty sure it's solving the 8 puzzle
fuck i still need to do that homework
no one has replied to my question yet 😦
i heard it also has roadhog in it
sure
but i'll come into the store to set that up for you
on your end, all you guys will have to do to update the stock is run a script
its developmental stuff ive been saving because it relies on the server configuration
over half
half of the things left to do rely on setting up the server
yes
even when i get this site done the limiting factor is now keenan's boss
i should
yeah seriously
so you can preview it
im not going to change the current redirection of gameworldindiana.com but im going to see if i can add a sub domain that goes to the test/development site
can you send me the login stuff byb the way
i would play now but i promised myself not to do anything fun until i get your site done
ok
are you guys going to play tonight?
fuck
are you guys playing overwatch
like observables
its completely different, angular2 handles most asynchronous things with reactive js data structures
asynchronously update a loading a icon while the search filter is working
and most of this morning
i spent literally all of last night trying
ronald i tried to resist i promise
I submitter my first stack overflow question
Guess what guys
give me a sec
what were you using vga for
it should be fine just be careful about the gpu
i dont think so as long as you aren't wreckless and everything is secured
i mean episode 2
keenan this is hilarious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHxZpk_hvJA
Uh yeah sure
Now I can change my IU passphrase back to something that references liquid
Aww yeah team liquid is back
Thus makes me realize i should go to IUs career fairs though
The Android stuffed thing and the Google bag seems useful
Most of that isnt useful/memorable though
After edits it only ended up being 190 words over so that's good
goddamnit i cant believe im already over the word limit but havent written my conclusion yet
im planning to finish everything this weekend so you if you dont you should try to get it on friday
keenan you have the login stuff for your webserver right?
i actually think its a good topic and is fun to write about i just have way too much other stuff to do tonight as well
still writing it
basically you keep playing games until you win and at the very point you win, the grand finals becomes a best of one
being an expert in them myself, i do
i dont think you understand how lucio ball grand finals work keenan
it was truly a momentus occasion
not many players can get that kind of advantage
i'll never forget the lucio ball grand finals i had last summer where i literally ran around the walls once we were up by 4 points on the other team
they really pushed me in the right direction and motivated me to get really good at one thing
i really have my parents to thank for that
i mean because i started my lucio ball career at such a young age, it contributed a lot to the fact that im so good at it today
and to this day, summer is still my least favorite season
because i was forced to play lucio ball with a bunch of people
summer used to be least favorite season for that same reason too
when i was young my parents enrolled me in a lucio ball camp
i dont think i am
i feel like hes the only pro player who finished colelge
They have fear as coach
They'll be strong
I would say bulba is.

After being presented with the decision of either pursuing a long-term career in esports or continuing on as an active pro player, one with an unforeseeable duration, he ultimately decided it best to transition into the business management role offered to him by Twitch.

I made my own relatively fuzzy search
I tried using a fuzzy search js library already made but it was like 4 times slower
It takes like 1 second to filter through 7500 items
I also imported the damerau-levenstein distance function
That's cuz I'm efficient
this search algorithm is my baby
and is the most pointless thing ive ever done
only took like 10 hours

im just saying i dont think any of us are really in a position to vouch for the validity of this list so you just have to be skeptical about it
how are you supposed to know who uses websites for what
i think you're just making shit up
anyway the only thing i know for sure is google and facebook are number 1 and 2, i dont trust anything else on this list
ebay is not designed nearly as much to browse as amazon is
amazon has way better browsing tools than ebay
i understand a lot of people use them but is it really more than twitter or instagram or netflix
i just dont trust it
twitter/instagram/netflix are definitely visited much more i'd think
how is yahoo number 4  and craigslist number 6
i dont believe that list
tell me when any of you guys wsant to play stuff
I don't think it was called that

delete key is far away, triple clicking is three clicks and sometimes you click too fast and it's actually a quad click
or theres no fast way to delete an entire line
and still there's no key that inserts a new line directly below or above
also the home button is far away and on most laptop keyboards you have to press a modifier key for it
the home button just goes to the top of the page
like normally if your cursor isin the middle of a line and you wanted to start a new line, you have to move it over to the end of the line and press enter.
but in vim you can just type o and it will insert a new line below and start at the front of that line no matter where your cursor is
i need this type of shit no matter what im editing
or below it
or above it
or one button to append new text to the front of the line
imagine if you were typing something, made a mistake, and had to arrow key back to the middle of the line.
now imagine there was just one button you could press to move your cursor back to the end of the line to append new text to it
i can barely even type in google docs or type an email because im so used to using vim shit
you just dont know what you're missing
you also have to account for the time it takes to move your hand away from the keyboard to the mouse and back again
it's not because you have to use a mouse to click anddrag over the text you want
or maybe you wanted to surround everything inside [ ] with parenthesis so you would type si[(
roonald i bet you cant type sw" to surround a word in "
i havent, half of my work is over ssh so i use vim for that.
I also use vim keybinds in every text editor/IDE
i think their dev team is aware that chromium and node means a large sacrifice in performance but it allows it to be completely hackable which is their main advertised feature
it's basically a web browser
node and chromium
yah
but on my desktop i can use atom since it loads instantly either way
since it's written in node and javscript instead of c
the reason i stopped using atom on my laptop is because it loaded up a lot slower than sublime
you'll have to do it on your desktop if you dont want lag
it's fun
you have to experience it yourself
but i get a smooth 60 fps on desktop
i had to turn it off on my laptop
no i think it's the particle effects
wtf if i want to get decent text editor fps i have to use my desktop

You should come over after I take a nap and go shopping
Cam you play stuff in like an hour?
the other maps arent balanced for that since they arent symmetric
that sounds interesting although the only problem is you would have to switch to an actual king of the hill map
like best of one king of the hill for tiebreaker?
as opposed to overwatch where you have no idea why you gain or lose what pints you did
you gain points when you win, you lose points when you lose, there are separate numbers for solo and party
not because the scoring system is flawed
if you complain about it's because you think you are ranked where you dont belong
no one complains about dota's elo system
i dont understand why all games with a ranked system use some stupid and complicated system when they could just do what dota does
they could have balanced it better instead of putting draws
because the previous thing was sudden death and i heard that was basically a coin flip depending on if you got attack or defense
Overwatch ranked is rigged as fuck
I warned you
It may be a good opportunity any way to finish the website because i was going to work on that this weekend.
I dont think I have much actual homework this time
Then both you and her can sit in my room while i do homework
You can come sit in.my room.and watch hulu while i do homework
You can come play overwatch with me tonight at my apartment

css is a lot faster
or sass if you want to make it formulaic
ronald im pretty sure you can accomplish what you want to do with css transformations

lol "Discord will not reconnect automatically to a voice channel on startup if it has been off for more than five minutes.
No more surprise moaning."
😦
I don't understand why EE said his team would consist of unknown players lol
its js
paper script is javascript
yeah you have to make a directive
cuz angular 1 sucks
you could use paper js to create shape objects
you would also use css most likely
but if you are just using css you can just set distances in %
sass lets you use math and functions and it compiles down to css
sass?
uh css?

there was another company similar to that i forgot the name though

im going to upgrade to the 100 version and we'll see how many i get
no i literally get max streetpasses everyday
i get max streetpasses everyda
idk a lot of people have 3ds
unless nintendo's game sucks
hopefully what a good game looks like
i think nintendo's will be a mainstream game which will show people
well not mainstream
they arent popular though
they are pretty good
yeah
it'sdecent
a game called Zenge
which isnt a big deal if i lose interest since that happens with every game but i mean these arent even memorable
even these games though lose my interest after a while
i frequently look for stuff that's good
yeah
idk probably 2 weeks ago
there aren't any games like that other than minecraft
the market needs someone like nintendo to prove that a well-polished, paid game can still be successful on the app store
im not denying that there were good games, but there just arent good games anymore
im just sad now that the most successful business model today encourages poor game design when there's so much potential
yeah and i played it in middle school, it's a classic.
back then you would pay 7 bucks for the entire game and actually get a good produc
and notice that pvz 2 went to the freemium model
pvz is great but was also a pc release
it's like these filthy casuals cant appreciate good game design
a mobile port doesnt count
what bothers me is that the most popular games now are the worst ones.
if you want something good it takes effort to find
in app purchases wasnt a thing
back then times were good
these days i try most of the popular ones and then i remember they are all the same shitty app
i had like two i really liked
and thats when i played the most mobile games
it's like they pitied the mobile gaming platform and had to show it what happens when you actually try to make a good game
doesnt mean i forgive them though
it's been like 9 years and nintendo may finally release the first good game on mobile
thats not a freemium model or has annoying ads or shitty mechanics
plus it may actually be the first high quality mobile game
i need to support nintendo
keenan i'll have you know im a hardcore gamer and i still plan on purchasing this new mario game
uuugggh
they are betraying me
wtf
wtf miyamoto was at apple's press conference today and they are bringing mario to app store
at the top right
you can also just mute the channel temporariliy

any ring can be of wedding variety and any ring can be a casual ring
such rings exist
non-decorative but also non-wedding
if i had a non-decorative ring it would also go on my ring finger
maybe she is compiling wedding dresses for a friend
if had a decorative ring i would also put it on my ring finger because any other finger is weird for a ring
how do you know it's not just a really decoartive normal ring
she seems like the type of person who would wear rings naturally for decoration
can you not supress your urges with mental powers
what temptation do you have

ok let me know
Technically i can drive but I can't drive other people and I don't have a car.
But if you don't go there are other people who can drive Clara I'm sure
It's like 25 minutes
Not want to go or not want to drive?
Haven't decided yet
Ya
im done with gameworld for tonight, that was a nice 30 minutes
yay i updated the data file to have real category names
i have no fucking clue what the psalms are so im going to go with pokemons
oh you can in user settings
he didnt
wut
without considerable effort
im trying to modfiy that python script i wrote you and i cant decipher it
i really need to annotate my code better
just like the gb micro
because the ds lite replaced the original nds while the the 2ds is sold along side the current 3ds
just hardware differences
the 2ds is identical to the 3ds except it doesnt have a paralax screen
the new 3ds has exclusive games, more trigger buttons, extra stick, faster processor, bigger screens, nfc chip, improved 3d effect
thats not true even remotely
and i didnt include the 2ds
no theh gameboy micro is to the advance as the 2ds is to the 3ds
yea
we are currently on Gameboy 9
im going to encode every iteration of the gameboy and the nintendo DS simply as 'Gameboy' so they are more recognizable
ronald knows it as Majora
and the latter is too long
because everyone and their mother knows what an NES is
not Nintendo Entertainment System
I'm also encoding n8 as NES
except maybe the Dreamcast
thats because sega stuff isn't well known enough to just call it saturn
if you just put Saturn people would be like wtf is saturn, that's a planet
Im putting Sega in front of all of Sega's shit so people know what they are
and the new one was Xbox One
I thought it was Xbox 1
what do you call the original xbox now
I mean PlayStation
like PLaySTation
is Playstaion capatilized
thats some advanced shit
wtf is the sega 32x
and ATA is atari right
32x?
and 32X
what is SAT
oh it's the Not in BRE stuff that I excluded anyway
theres GAMES and GAMESH
poop
whats GAMES
that's also sega right
and what's DC?
im assuming GEN is sega genesis?
second NES
s for second
would have made more sense to do SN8
AH
WHAT IS SN
the second console must be called N32 because 8*4 is 32
it's the first console.
8 * 1 is 8.
the third console is the nintendo 64.
8 * 8 is 64
shit i know why it's called the n8
do you think i should encode things as "NES" or "nintendo entertainment system"
WTF
KEENAN WHAT IS N8
no one knows where that comes froms
they are just copying from other stack overflow posts
bitch everyone knows computer science is really just copy and paste from stack overflow
and the remaining 20 is actual coding
the other 30 percent is spent bug fixing
yes but half of the hours are spent researching
that would be dumb
web design work is never hourly
i feel bad because im slow
i dont want to until i can prove i have a good product
i'll probably get paid but keenan and i havent discussed any real figure yet
i literally just started looking at it now because im bored of real work and im going to go to bed soon
actually i didnt
this isnt for the public good this is for the personal good
WHY ISNT IT PS1
wtf is PSX
shit you guys have 53 category ID's that i have to map to real things
the other way to deal with that is exit discord
im no sex expert but im pretty sure that's not what it looks like
what is that
😉
yeah i would consider myself part german
mercy was probably born in germany with a german family and then moved to switzerland for work
north america
a canadian is american
her last name is german
i dont care
she speaks german
https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/518y78/100_german_booty/
damnit there was a post on the overwatch subreddit titled "100% German booty" and I thought it was going to be about mercy but it was about reinhardt...
I can't fix it
Unfortunately my brain is wired wrong and an A means more to me than money
I'm in that phase of programming where i can't stop thinking about search algorithms and it's distracting me from real homework
the only difference is now you dont have the server slowdown of fetching the data
angular is all client side
the search algorithm speed is going to depend on their computer regardless
keenan why do you have twice as many baseball games as you do mario games
it's also only 2.4 mb so at most it will take as long to load as a normal size image
i wonder if the browser caches the json file too
even though there are 12,000 objects in it
i really love how fast searching through a plain json file is
i dont know how their server is configured and if i can run pyhton scripts on it
i have a python script which generates json from their stock database
keenan or someone will upload a new json file every week
it's also an http call to a local location so it doesnt take any time
because http allows you to read the file as an observable
which i make an angular http ccall to
only a json file
but yeah i can rank by number of matching keywords if necessary
well the probably wont even be a keyword
it's mostly going to be filters
i dont think i'll have to sort anything besides titles by alphabet and price
it matters to for code readability and for the ability to implement modern design patterns
it's some ugly shit.
here's the javscript equivalent of that same file
javascript is really shitty for building large applications because it lacks a module system, classes, type declarations, etc
because typescript makes a lot more sense
yeah
thats typescript which compiles down to javascript

so you dont end up wth languages like java which are way too verbose
only in typscript
(args)=>{ body } is the shorthand form
it's just an unnamed function
lambda functions in javascript look like (function(args){ body })()
no it's just shorthand
item is the arg, the stuff after the => is the function body
lambda
return items.filter((item)=> item.itemName.toLowerCase().indexOf(query) !== -1);
it's pretty pro
do you want to see my current search logic
i didnt read too much on it
apparently a sorting filter requires things that cant be compressed
like compressed
idk
they didnt include them natively because thy wanted it to run minified or something
you have to write it yourself
or an orderBy pipe
angular2 doesnt even have a filter pipe
didn't we just use the native filter pipe
i rememebr the campus cache search worked pretty well
is that what we did for campus cache?
it's very basic right now
thats what im doing
my worst nightmare
😦 my search doesnt find titles called "legend of zelda ___" when I search "the legend of .." but only when I search "legend of" without "the"
keenan im glad you shared that video.
i saw it on the subreddit and never opened it but since you shared it i felt like it was worth watching
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wATsIeQDLts
theres also a music video like that about arteezy
polygon got it from r/overwatch
/r/overwatch
of that singer
i need more








keenan can you send me that 1-up graphic
if you play in a party like we did it's less likely to get leavers
i wouldn't recommend playing solo queue
apparently leavers in ranked is a big problem
like 90 minutes
but there were 3 where i lost simply because someone left
no i played more than 3
in overwatch you just have to play 5 v6 the rest of the time
it's not even like dota where if someone leaves you get a slight advantage to make up for it
i played a bunch of ranked this morning and loss 3 games because there were leavers on my team
it used to be percentile based i think it was "too confusing" so they just made it more confusing
no
what
all you have to do is change the default output device in sound settings
what computer problems were you having
35,000 viewers
i just turned on miracle's stream nd he has 4 rapiers as kunkka in a 65 minute game against megas
ronald stop playing fallout
is he on a smurf?
BibleThump
and maybe wyvern but i have to see that one in game
yeah but i do like the sniper and necro sets
which would make sense if he got an offer from liquid or whatever
and i guess bulba was going to be on envy's new team but then left for whatever reason
seems really idiotic
i dont know why puppey teams jsut stop scrimming before ti
ya i listen to all of them
new team confirmed
the only people he has on his friends list are zai, crit, sumnail, bloody nine, and 747
rtz is back
ronald do you want to play something
today is only day i can though
yo i can play stuff
Ok
A new "Allied Health Bars" option has been added (Options > Controls)
omg mercy +20% healing i forgot
omg new map i forgot
dont you know how high noon works
it's ok when it's high noon in america it's also high noon in france
http://i.imgur.com/JSCibmJ.gifv
i honestly didnt pay attention that much to that part of the broadcast
idk
shit i probably have to go outside for that
idk
Need to do some important things
We need to make sure to stay hydrated
Still better than Ronald's hot Key's
pretty sure the latter
wait i cant tell if this jeremy guy actually hates you or if it's just a joke between friends
i think all the good jokes need to be reserved for google plus
oh i see was it amessage to someone you know named jeremy
what was the hitler joke?
who can read text that small on your screen unless they are literally right over your shoulder
dont be a cunt
this is closing soon if any of you are interested
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/84288219/diabotical-by-the-gd-studio?ref=project_tweet
i will only play stuff when i have some *key* things done first
no im not going to play
guys i feel like we cant have serious discussions anymore
who the fuck even plays that game
like who the fuck makes a cover of the music in pokemon go
i didnt actually listen to it
have important work to do
NO
no i just saw a cover of one of it's themes on youtube
wtf pokemon go has music?
sounds like a long marathon
keenan how have you played lisa if you dont own it on steam
i dont understand hy this song has air horns
i think you mean this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-i7Hj1fAYN4
i play non-nintendo games with good music
boy
if there's a good sound track it inspires me to actually play the game
i listen to game and movie sound tracks way more than i play or watch them
its hard yo
i dont thin thats what asher is talking about though
dkc returns is hard af
damnit dude i havent got to the end of my history book yet
it spoils the fact that thor wasn't in civil war
yes
civil war spoilers jesus
🍆
yeah me too
no
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/50izr1/support_circle_jerk_you_are_dazzle/
play what
but it doesnt matter since this is only for indiana
yeah vermont is basically a confederate state
i wonder if it will be controversial but the lgbq and the confederate flag cancel out
you're right mac, it's brilliant
Stupid x 2 = smart
I think you forgot that it already looks stupid
That's twice as many dumb drawings as world could have
No in Indiana you can have 2 I's replaces with Indiana
The logo looks.so much better in black and white
Rip joindota
Blitz is gone too since he's coaching DC
Cap left join dota and is going back to the u.s.
with rnadom guy instead of bulldog
almost exactly as rumored
those fuckers
ugh it's a nintendo select in europe
yeah i'll probably wait though, this is like a 3 year old game it has to go on sale
but i want some mario rpg
for this game
how risky is buying a pre-ownded game from game world
i dont understand how a pre-owned game is only 5 dollars cheaper
i know
but im sure it's in stock at some best buy store just not near bloomington
does that still count
it's listed on their website though
i mean bestbuy has the pre-ownded version for 20 bucks but it's not able to be shipped and it's not in stock in any nearby stores
it should be though
yea
only in europe i think
but it's not a nintendo select
how come gameworld has a used copy for $33 but bestbuy's used copy is $20
how risky is buyin a used 3ds game from game world
btw i need that informational brochure
if only there was a website where i could check
does gameworld have mario and luigi dream team in stock
maybe it will even have benefits
maybe if you become good enough friends she will become unmarried
is she married or just engaged
good discussion.
is mac really the type of person to fuck with you
i just checked the settings and nothings looks wrong
what
but it's really just me talking to you one-way via text while you are in voice chat since i cant talk right now
ok "mac"
mac, you only played fallout new vegas for like 5 hours before you got bored, how could you possibly be into fallout 4
what do you mean again
yes
captain america is good
to watch either
i dnot have time
i want to watch it again
actually they can read the history, it's not revealing anyway
messages have to be deleted one by one
i censored that
shh
🍆
really?
yeah
give me a hexcode
i can do that by assigning you to a role that does nothing but alter color
do you want your name to be a specific color
there was one point for me when message history seemed like it was gone too but eventually it came back
because you have permissions
you might have to restart discord
but you should still be able to see message history
so everything is secret now
but anyway, i disabled message history for the main channel
you can kick/ban me im pretty sure
yes but the only thing i can do that you guys cant do is change who is owner
?
for the first few days i just wanted it to be clear what it was for
i just named it that
ok good
poop
bitch
neither of us can hear that
!AIRHORN
PLEB
this one is for plebs
we dont use this chat anymore
because you are an admin
you might have to restart discord
thats what admin only is for
because i realized anyone like my brother or one of his friends can come in here and read our weird ass conversations
i know im experimenting with roles
now do you?
yeah if you had the foresight to do that because they stopped you from buying battle passes on the 13th
jsut sell the chests
the the chances are slim even for the lowest level of rarity
200 dragon claw hooks represent less than 5% of the total available drops for that item
scroll down to the tust of benefactor part
https://www.dota2.com/international/battlepass/
yeah they will because only 25x20 were put out
oh yeah dont open the chest
http://i.imgur.com/L3YS69O.png
also valve made a golden version of the bzz set that is the rarest drop
because i got the normal rare items occassionally
no but i doubt normal rare items are the same rarity as the normal rare items in the immortal chests
like not very rare or extremely rare or ultra-rare, just rare
like the dragonclaw hook is 150 dollars and apparently only a rare drop
there are a lot of possible rare drops in this benefactor chest and if you do get one of them it will be worth a lot more than the chest
you can just to see
you know more about how the steam market works
idk
so unless you think you are going to get a drop worth more than the selling price of the chest
definitely not worth it
i opened mine and got 3 basic drops, worth about 1 dollar combined
if you look at the reddit link there's a list of drops and their rarities
yes
they are only an hour old as of now
but it will probably go down fast as more people open dota and get theirs
around 4 dollars
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/50davy/dota_2_update_main_client_august_30_2016/
right now each one is worth 4 dollars
you should sell your trust of the benefactor chests before the price goes down too much
Definitely interested.
But is there a registration fee?
I can fly for free
?
Good lick
ah
did this kyle starks guy draw rick and morty
i dont see anything but the date at the top of posts
i dont know how tumblr reposts work
how do i tell what things on your tumblr are things you made and what isnt
and at least one of you has to be mercy
link?
only if both of you are cosplaying while doing it
either way you can become friends with her at least
or she is just friendly
is he with her at comic place
how would you know about this ronald you havent even watched spotlight

join the voice
this is the last one
yes they will expire anyway after this im pretty sure
really good at pudge and timber
he's 3k
yeah he is
we need one more person ronald
how many tickets do you have
im telling them to get on their discord
I'm 2 min away
I'm almost home
She cosplayed as Dva Ronald.
Probably because she secretly is D.va
How did they have enough grounds to suspend him then
Wasn't he accused of rape or some sexual harassment thing
She has like 1000 friends on Facebook
She has two mutual friends with me, Beth Maben and Jessica True
It wasn't a threat it was an excellent strategy for Keenan to get sex
And by that you mean smash bros
Ask her if she wants to smash
In like 15 min i can
Like recognize that you are in her class
Do you participate in class discussions enough for her to know you at least
If you friend requested her would she recognize you
Are you following all of them now
She has every social media thing
Lol
How do you know she beat dark souls 3
But even the brown might be dyed
I think brown is her Natu hair color and the rest are wigs
keenan wants to date lindsey stirling
yes i can be on in like 30 min
if a team like alliance isnt really getting results then players should want to leave to new teams.
but they dont because they get a decent salary even without results.
if the organization leaves then there's no incentive to stick together
which could explain why zai and fear were removed
EG might also be dead too since they were owned by the same person
alliance is disbanded i think ever since their owner left
zai, mss, rtz, and crit might be on team together
1.
Liquid.Matumba
2.
Liquid.M1racle
3.
Liquid.Mindcontrol
4.
Liquid.Bulba
5.
Liquid.Kuroky
1.

2.

3.
OG.AdmiralBulldog
4.
OG.Jerax
5.
OG.Fly
zai also was released from EG
well i think im going back to liquid after 2 long years
no but secret decided to officially announce their roster so a bunch of other stuff is getting announced/leaked in response
jerax and bulldog to OG
bulba and miracle to liquid
i think fear retired
secret is SEA now
i cant play until later tonight
alliance might be gone as an organization
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4zvshs/is_something_happening_to_gga/
fear kicked from eg
shit new rosters
makes no sense
i dont understand how it can rank me 76th percentile in medals and practically everything else but then 8th percentile overall
like 76th percentile overall on medals
although i think overbuff's percentile system is fucked up because im above 60th percentile for every mercy stat except healing but i still am only 8th percentile on her for some reason
also in 80th percentile for elims on mercy
im in the 97th percentile for sheilds given as symmetra lol
whats superfetch
roooooooonald
my first point still remains
you have to use skill and shit to aim
because it's more fast paced than dota
you cant just do battle cup without having played for a week
will play dota though
im too tired to play overwatch
?
dota
also turn off game dvr in the xbox gaming app
you should still turn the windows tip feature off anyway
is it just at boot up
no the one about disk issues
did you see link
https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/4zqox0/whats_the_difference_between_everybody_and_bullets/
ronald i want to play underlord but no one is online dota
that may be true but are you really happy about it
i feel like you should probably stop using tinder
lol
wut
that would have been an easy investment
shit ronald 24 battle pass levels on the market are selling for 14 dollars
drum lady
ok

I can help diagnose later when I get home.
My motherboard uses very similar if not the same drivers
For LAN connection
Did you install the proper network drivers
It looks like you are using Ethernet
Do you think it's a network issue
Idk what your talking about
Where are you reading disk usage from?
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4zo0pk/i_am_morphling/
Although i think fallout 4 performance depends a lot on your processor
Yea 700s were released in 2013
My first computer was built in 2011 and it used 500 series
The 700 series is only like 3.5 years old
That's pretty good
I thought you had a 750ti
How do you even mod console games
If you want to use mods you shouldn't use consoles.
Can't you just get it on PC
Fallout is even more detailed
You said overwatch was too much to look at
Ronald i thought the default graphics were too realistic for you
The latter
Why not show us fallout character

idk
ANY ONE WANT TO PLAY GAME
Shit man that's revolutionary

Waka teki wow = I only play hanzo and my team sucks
the bug will probably be fixed by tomorrow but thats fine
when yu finish your computer i want to see a picture
they still haven't fixed the morphling pitlord bug, we should try to get in a ranked + 500 bet game today with ronald as morphling
we dont
no
better exploit this now ronald https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4zf5v8/til_replicating_pit_lord_as_morphling_gives_him/
It's on Amazon prime
i just dont know how i feel about the story
everything about the show like camera work, acting, music, is all really good
no it's a continuous drama
it's really psychotic
i havent seen any other usa shows besides psych
i dont know if i like it
mr robot doesnt make any sense any more
he eats a lot
im pretty sure all of his weight is muscle
he's 131 pounds
lol
the other ones are similar
where you go
where he go
ronald!
i can in a bit
I feel like on a video like this bad comments is a given
why do you need context
and brings everyone far away
also asher this basically the saving potential of naga ult except longer cooldown
i dont know how to feel about these videos https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvvwBNmbjg3P8pn8uOKFXJQ/videos
literally io
foreign languages are just too much work compared to computer languages
every time i have to think about foreign language i regret not taking german
lol
he took it at the wrong time
i feel bad for him
tommy dedeck was in my latin class semester
im sure everyone gets angry but most can at least be respectful about it
it's just as bad
but other people cant just ignore him they have to make a dumb remark at everything he says
and im pretty sure the rest of us were too
im really good at ignoring jacob bissey
no in my latin class that i dropped
i couldn't tell what was worse, the fact that jacob bissey was in my class or the fact that there were 3 idiots who always made snarky comments or whispered to each other every time jacob talked
so i'll just wait another semester to take it
because my class had the same annoying people as last semester
i literally just dropped latin
you just got to dodge
in small class sizes you dont really get unmotivated people
in lectures though it is easier to ignore people you dont like
you just have to take small class sizes
ive never had to deal with business major classmates
well yeah thats the point we were discussing in my class with clara, in general college gives you a lot more freedom with how you choose to learn the material
apush was all notes and thats just not how i learn
if i took history now i might be able to do well
lol
someone should teach a class on note taking  because if i could take notes i could do this stuff
fucking hard
on Electriciy and magnetism in AP physics i also got a 2
in ap us history i got an A but i got a 2 on ap test which many people said was the easiest one
in college latin i got a but it was much easier
in ap latin i got b's i think
for example history or physics or latin
yeah the things i suck at i dont get a's in
thats not true there are many things i suck at
i wish i took notes
i think those two things are basically the same in this context
they definitely speed it up
they definitely help studying
the homework and quizzes
idk the readings
im pretty sure not taking notes makes you have to study more
and i do have to study
i did not argue
word
wod
why cant people type the fucking work mac
she's hired to report my whereabouts and actions
im pretty sure asher is stalking me through his gf
oh i thought it was three classes
i was confused there for a second
i appreciate everything and everyone
thats not that weird
isnt that just a lab
this dude is definitely a support
i only play games that have new heroes

btw i think i figured out how to play underlord
you're right i just tested it
Black King Bar lets Underlord sustain himself longer in fights, and can prevent his Dark Rift from being interrupted.
not according to the wiki
well if he's a core he's one that can build utility items
his ult can be canceled with stuns
the other thing is that i dont really think he fits into any role but im guessing he would be support
i feel like it would be an aoe base relocate then
oh then that would be good
his ult seems really weak considering the cooldown
He seems pretty weak
:( still at class

like after 6:30
i have a meeting in a bit but can play later in the evening
new vega roster
is the american one a summer set?
http://i.imgur.com/43mJKG3.jpg
i can probably play one game
im glad they fixed that
it really bothers me how genji can do his dash attack and it destroys junkrat's trap instead of triggering it
i kind of want to play dota to get rid of my 500 tokens but dont have to if you are agoing to play tomorrow before 6pm
my guests are finally dead
We have guests at our apartment i have to entertain
Except he was just nerfed a bit
That's what i did and we won
Idk the time i had mist success was when it was mostly people on my team that i wasn't in voice comm with and didn't know in real life
I'm just running late now
I'll be able to play stuff later today btw
You might have a chance
Ok that's fine gl
Ethan and noctis wanted to play
Play
In like 10 minutes.
Can you okay next week?
Ok I'm not sure if I can do it today but I'll see when i get home
In the client countdown timer
Im not home right now but i will be around 8:00 or 8:30 i think
Is it today or Sunday
i really hate how there's no gifting
Lol
The graphics for fallout 4 actually look pretty nice based on that video
ok so that 'gg ez' filter is a real thing.
a dev added it as a joke for the next update but it's only in the beta client
keenan i just downloaded 32 GB and no virus was obtained
the graphics are probably set a lot than on the ps4 too
http://downloadmoreram.com/
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOfow6cvF3g
I thought earlier you said you can run it on low
http://www.dota2.com/darkpurpose/+
k
so you can use them either in phones/laptops or a desktop
also most non-usb headsets come with an adapter like that
there are also usb headsets
desktops typically have separate speakers/mic and laptop ports are combo because they are smaller and dont usualy have that stuff
it's a standard thing
You're trying to plug a combo mic/sound plug into just a headphone jack
It's not drivers
Yes unless you get a headset thst has two plugs
What
That's why i use
Yeah i have one if those
i forgot
same
i cant play for like another hour
im sorry i cant do this
shit boy
i mean ronald
join the discord
k
https://www.twitch.tv/beyondthesummit mafia lan
Yeah
I'll tell you how next time I'm in call
Ronald that's not how you bash
no im in your party
?
i can do one game
instead of all these new trailers
why dont they just release the games already
i like those turn based strategy
i see
havent tried the new 3ds ones but they are probably good
idk i really like fire emblem
the best star fox game is super smash bros melee
with ness and lucas
it's okay they live in smash bros now
rip
no\
cuz purple is a nicer color for lights
ican make my computer change colors but i like it on purple
you can probably have it slowly cahnge between all the colors
to whatever you want
apparently the msi card has the white LED light on the side that you can change the color of in software
it could be useful
like running a game on one monitor and a fullscreen stream on another
for rendering or editing video yes a graphics card is nice
oh i guess also the 8gb might be slightly better at powering more than one monitor if you ever do that
if your display is dvi idk
the reference card doesnt have dvi
and has a dvi port
yes you can tell because it's not just a rectangle
eventually games will use higher quality textures and even if you arent changing the screen resolution the high quality textures will require more ram
it really depends on the reviewer and the user whether they think the extra 4GB is worth it
it will be more future proof
and the difference is usally 5-7 fps more
i mean you can look at the benchmark charts in these reviews
yes but you shouldn't need to overclock it
this is a third reviewer and these are his conclusions
ok read this page https://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/msi_radeon_rx_470_gaming_x_8gb_review,34.html
im not sure about that but his argument may be legit
the second reviewer says that 8gb is pointless on a rx 470 because the card runs out of horsepower before the extra texture maemory would be required
the second reviewer takes issue with the fact that the 8gb model of the 470 is more expensive than some 4gb models of the 480
here's one for the 8gb http://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/zardon/msi-rx-470-gaming-x-8g-review/
heres a review for the 4gb model http://www.notebookcheck.net/MSI-Radeon-RX-470-Gaming-X-4-GB-Review.171114.0.html
more VRAM means you can load sharper textures at higher res
VRAM is whats used mainly to store texture data
which one you get depends how much you care about resolution
there's also a 4GB version that's 40 bucks cheaper
hold on
it does but the reason they can afford to run at a higher speed is because custom designs always have better cooling systems to make up for it
usually it's higher than the reference cards
boost clock is what the manufacturer set the clock speed to out of the box
did you see the benchmark video ronald?
the only reason i didnt was because there was a sale for an EVGA card
i almost bought an MSI card for my computer so i've done a lot of research on the brand
msi's gaming X series is one of the better ones
yeah
no but if you look at the first link to /r/buildapcsales there is an in stock listings
it also takes up way less disk space
yeah
well to change boot time you would have to reinstall windows on the ssd
or maybe your laptops drive was just slow as fuck
must
nice you much have a pretty fast hard drive
custom rx 470's are the same price as reference rx 480's and the custom cards are still on par if not better
it's like the same performance
i sent you a video with benchmarks
yes
i thought your computer plays it better
thats not even good keenan
ronald look at what i sent you

Give me 5 min
Just got home
Rip Skeleton King ☹️
Until 11
I'm busy

Triggered.
What is game freak game
What is game freak fame
Game freak don't do steam
Where do you find game freak game
Movie shit movie shit movie shit wait what game freak game?
movie shit movie shit
Well then you need a USB adapter or something
Yes if you have Bluetooth on your computer
Small fans mean loud
Look at the size of the fan in the reference design
Faster and more cooling and quieter
There's a lot of reviews that don't recommend reference designs because custom  designs are almost always better
You want a good graphics card that will last you 4 years or more
Took me like 30 min
Like the one the guy mentioned
And more likely to have problems
Not as good
You probably held a reference design one
I'll play tonight
Look at a comparison between that and the 480
In stock and same price as the msi Rx 480
https://m.newegg.com/Product/index?itemnumber=N82E16814127963&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-Mobile&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-Mobile-_-pla-_-Video+Card+-+Nvidia-_-N82E16814127963&gclid=CjwKEAjwudW9BRDcrd30kovf8GkSJAB3hTxF5IoFkhJA87n7QbOaGpcTIobJs8yyaGNP9bp_8Ko0rBoCCgPw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds
Which one
The 900 series from Nvidia or the r9 series from Radeon
I'll tell you
Or you can get one if last year's cards
The gtx 1060 is comparable i thought
It's cheaper but custom designs are improved in many ways
I think the reference design may have been the one with problems
Like MSI for example improve the cooling a lot by changing the fan from a blower design and adding a new fan
Manufacturers usually make both the reference design and their own custom design
That's the reference design you linked
so beautiful
https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1271034-REG/msi_radeon_rx_480_gaming.html
btw since your case is red and black you should get the matching msi card
you still have to put the graphics card power wires in
i dont know why it would be bad unless you are worried they would unravel
pres del
its saying del for bios
no wait
press f9 or 12
read the motherboard manual for the exact key or just spam all of them
you need to spam Delete or f2 or f1 or f12 to get in the bios
this picture looks liek your overwatch settings
and after windows installs it will be the hard drive
your boot drive will be the win10 flashdrive
but does it register your hard drive
if you got into the bios and it is correctly registering your processor speed, cores, ram speed, and ram amount, and hard drive, then it should be good
but it's not necessary to have, just if things aren't working it will tell you the error with a beep code
like it will do one short beep if everything is good
its useful for diagnosing issues
oh some motherbaords come with a motherboard speaker that will beep various amounts of time to indicate errors with boot up
oh thats for the front panel jacks
do you have windows on a bootable flash drive already?
So did you plug in the stuff from the front io panel of the case
Did your motherboard come with a ssmall speaker
You can test it out even before you put the sides on
You can yeah
1 case fan?
Send me a picture of the power cable for the two front fans
I thought they were 4 pin
Unlikely
Yeah i think it's so you can only plug in one way but I'm not sure
It clears space in the front for better air flow
Yeah that's what the back is for, all the cables
thats how you know
to keep dust out of the intake fan
there's a dust filter on the bottom of the case
the power supply fan is intake so you put it on the bottom
at least in most cases
it shoould only screw in one way
down
you'll also have gpu wires
yea
as long as you got that correct it should be fine
there should be a notch in the plug so that it only plugs in one way
it might be variable speed control or something
yes the 4th prong is optional, some fans have it for other things
you put it on the sys fan
oh a 3 will plug into a 4
then they probably use molex which is on the power supply
no it's good so that you dont drop screws on the pcb circuit board
it really ruins binge watching
i really hate when shows do a 1-2 minute "previously on" segment before it starts
one or both of the case fan wires might plug into the motherbaord too for power
there will be a lot more
you can zip tie all the wires later
also if you still ahve that anti-static plastic wrap the motherboard came in, it's good practice to build on top of it because it's anti static and shit
i/o panel in case first
so you can slot the i/o panel into it
but you want to put the back panel in first
but yeah the mother board fits on top of the mounts
lol the single ram looks weird
the case and/or motherboard
the motherboard should have
and screw it into the mounts
they stay in there and you put the motherboard on top
those look like they are just mounts
what do you mean
nvm i forgot you are using stock cooler
you put the motherboard in the case before you put the heat sink on right?
butt he stickers labeling it can stay on
only if it's like that plastic wrap stuff you are suuposed to peal off
you can also put the disk in a computer witha slot and put the stuff on a flash drive and install it that way
liek sound and stuff
yes it's just drivers for windows
yeah that will be online
acuitally proabbly all
most can be gotten online
no
😦
why it be like this
the video is just him destroying other turtles
yeah lol

lol chat is spamming POTG
shit wall-e what happened buddy
is this the same jeff that makes the boring update videos
PogChamp
rip skeleton king
and now he's called wraith king
blizzard made valve remove skelton king
the skeleton king in the castle is why he no longer exists in dota
payload then control point right?
it's reverse hybrid
instead of the same play of the game soundtrack over and over again
i wish overwatch actually had music like this during gameplay
I really like the music fo this map though
idk but why are they talking about shit that's been out for two weeks
this is kind of akward
https://www.twitch.tv/blizzardatgamescom
2 minutes
cool
at iu?
true
they havent updated their game really since launch and dont communicate at all
are both basically ea
and riot
lol niantic
its not that hard to not be ea
our lord and savior
still not as good as the icefrog
part of the reason i got it was because they promised they would continually update it and do free DLC and not do that greedy shit they do with their other games
what do you mean
hearthstone is a little too much RNG but thats true of every card game so im fine with it
hots is an easy game made for children and should not be competitive either
starcraft and hearthstone are fine
it's definitely not ready yet
with a pro scene
I also sitll dont believe overwatch should be a competitive game
i dont think this shit matters at all in pubs
yeah but they shouldn't just rotate out the two strong characters at the top, everything should be viable
but that aint evena normal curve
and then you have dota where 105 out of 110 heroes were picked in the international
?
its okay keenan a new overwatch short about bastion comes out at noon
You at least for practice
Idk if i should feel more bad for you or the store because it's their loss
I would consider it good practice
This is more hilariously dumb than sad
Lol
That's like the stupidest reason ever
:(((((
It also bothers me that they nerfed stuff about him that it took skill and practice to do.
So basically if you're really good at genji you were nerfed but if you weren't it doesn't matter much
That was too much
Maybe everything but the ultimate nerf
Nerf
Also i feel like the only need genji needed was the dash not triggering junkrat trapa
Start the ult
It does but the projectile you throw to start the hot doesnt
I bet that guy Geoff literally played one game of mei, tried to ult, it bounced off a Reinhardt sheild, so he got pissed and changed it
And their "developer comments" make their changes soumd even stupider.
They don't need a shitty justification for every change they make in their own game
They need their own icefrog
I feel like blizzard sucks at balancing things
It's linked at the bottom of that article.
They have.
https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/blog/20243886
no it was "i was getting a premium pay to get to indy fast and there was a shit ton of traffic so i had to make up time"
it's so obvious its not an accident
can you even appeal that
he was probably like 15 over the speed limit at least
just like TI
ez predictions
hehe
he's casually 15-0 as storm spirit at 15 minutes in the game
lol arteezy blitz and charlie are streaming together https://www.twitch.tv/blitzdota
yes
did you study hard
yeah the 100 covers the cost of potential tickets
im pretty sure the shuttle is much cheaper
oh good because then traffic would be op
by the hour?
lol
oh okay i was wondering because the campus traffic has mostly died down now
where are you?
🐸
when does philip come over
anyone want to play game?
Not including any of the old players
No the only secret rumor that o believe is puppey +4 more
2 hours ago i would have
im not sure i have to do more packing and im kind of tired
here's the example i think i was remembering
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/33z828/reddit_what_movie_helped_you_through_a_rough_time/
almost the exact same thing happened in some other ask reddit thread
it's definitely not something original that reddit has done
i feel like ive seen something like this before but cant remember what it was
i love how the whole thing was started by a guy who was drunk and commented on reddit
apparently it's a reverse hybrid map, so payload first, then control point
no that map isnt supposed to come until september
what up[date
ok let me know when you want to
how long is the drive
are you still in a hotel?
this also looks like reinhardt's home town
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3xFKckFCGM&feature=youtu.be
Gotta get them dusties out
he is so beautiful when he's all exposed
do any of you want to play something tonight besides keenan because i unfriended him?
Shit this confusion is probably why they changed the ranking system
Did you know 48 means you are better than 48 people?
That's pretty good
Nah
Unfriended.
Wow dude now i have to play solo queue
yah
wut
Where is that
yeah our battle cup game
https://discord.gg/jzBtn
oh nathan kensur is here
you can also still spectate
you can be invited if you want
for the voice comms
im in my brother's chat
i am
i am
lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOyPWP-MwzE
boi
ok
want to playy overwatch
oh yeah then yes
nu
so apparently you can run it at 1080p with integrated graphics with medium settings and 50%-75% render and get 30 fps
https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&rlz=1C1GIGM_enUS676US676&q=intel+hd+530+graphics+overwatch&oq=intel+hd+530+graphics+overwatch&gs_l=serp.3...0.0.1.125.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c..64.serp..0.0.0.4oJiIQh-bCU
nu
ronald you shoudl read this https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/4l7u6w/what_games_are_playable_using_the_integrated/
MSI, sapphire, gigabyte are all good brands for radeon cards
nvidia's stock cards often have problems too but the custom manufacturers often fix them
well i think as long as you dont get the stock model it wont have problems
mis is pretty good
did microcenter only have the stock version in stock?
its still not a gaming computer without the graphics card
maybe
they will mention it
just read reviews on it
and it's always fixed in subsequent revisions and patches
newer cards almost alwayhs have problems liek that when they come out
also manufacturers have their own fix
said they fixed it i think
amd responded to that
look it up
a lot of people think that series is bad
YES
BOYS
and have a low wattage build
im still a bit worried about your PSU but it should be fine since you arent doing overclocking or anything
oh ok its compatable
i dont trust store guys
k
to be compatable with the skylake series
also i cant really read the model of that motherboard but i tried to look it up and it said socket type was LGA 1155 and you need LGA 1151
they aren't great but aren't terrible either
actually nvm it seems like they are ok for mid range gaming builds
it might be diifferent now though
look it up
the corsair CX series is notoriously not the best quality
what parts
which one
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4xncln/chinese_reactions_and_memes_regarding_ti6_grand/
because i cant find the button for it and i looked it up and it varies by book
apparently it's a publisher decision
i dont think any of my books are loanable
then no
so apparently some books aren't loanable
game of thrones
the martian
im reading this https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_rel_topic?ie=UTF8&nodeId=200549320&ref=cssoc_FM_RE_KLN and i cant find the loan button on amazon's website
but still
whats the point of having so many separate emails
wetf kind of email is that
yeah whats the email you used
i mean exactly yetr
and i haven't added up my normal predictions yet
not sure what i'll get from fantasy yet
i think i won at least 10,000 points from everything
thats fine im tired anyway
🍆
it was stomp
dc
k
watch dota
lol
or just doesnt like me
yeah but keenan is afk i think
idk i dont think he's actually playing
but it's match point so we'll see
this is probably goint to end up as 3-1 like every other grand finals
score is 1-1., dc may be coming back from a big wings lead game 3
join call;
ronald just watch it wiht us
yes
game 3
no
ronald this guy has your new favorite sign
DC outdrafted them so hard
although wings would have decent late game if silencer could not fall behind in farm
ronald is always wrong about who has better late game
storm is their only real lategame
silencer is falling behind in farm and has no farming mechanism
void + timber is realyl good
no
dc has better lategame
why would it ever be impossible
"i feel like dc lost already"
i dont know how players handle the pressure
damn
so this is a 6 million dollar series
no
you have to time it so the tp completes at the exact same time as the return completes
no because the return to relocate cancels the tp
yeah but it's literally a 0.1 second window
or egm
i think kuroky
ive only ever seen one player do it
its really hard to time it right
now thats a pretty good use of pudge hook
wings didnt ban it because they think they can counter it
the only team where timber is first ban is DC
mirana is good no matter who the palyer is
timber is only good if the palyer is good
yes
its like asking how is dk armor passive or visage armor passive balanced
if he didnt have that he would be shit
maybe their support players cant play pudge
he can, i wonder why more teams dont pick him
their the only team that realizes support pudge is legit
but the pudge is normal for wings
i think the core silencer is a good timber counter
i cant belive im seeing a core silencer and a core skywrath in the same game
old meme
he's amazing
wow
i love how w33ha can play so many heroes
when they cheer moo it sounds like they are booing
moo is so good
im fine if either team wins as long as it goes 5 games
also on the prizetracker site
yeah it's on dota2.com
ld said he's focusing less on casting now and more on managing his business
pudge
wings is the only team that picks puge
it's not any drive it's a euro drive
lol i just went to ethan's room to see why he was playing euro truck simulator instead of watching TI and no joke he was on his phone googling "best truck euro truck 2"
i really like how they have real drummers for the drafting music
what if dc use it next game
usually it's banned though
keenan Io is pretty common pick
60 FUCKIONG PERCENT
60%
mirana is fucking 60%
goddamnit he only has a 52% winrate
you dont even know
no keenan dont encourage ronalds timber hate
lol
not ld, maut, cap, or blitz
it's ok i forgot to today
the stage flamethrowers are a nice touch
they dont fuk up hats
im sure valve will make it good
tjeres only one item that changes omni slash color
join discord
im just keeping the stream on in the background
im cmoing
also i want to see who wins the film contest
ok
DC needs a break
#dicksoutforio
hes like my best carry
i'll probably actually buy the jugg arcana
chat right ow is pretty pissed
but their memes dont include io
the chinese have better memes than us
everyone voted for jugg becaused they thought io would win anyway
honestly it was probably because they didnt do the leading thing
all the comments say rigged lol
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4xl8xv/juggernaut_won_the_arcana_vote/
IO WAS PICKD 107
HE WAS PICKED 6 TIMES
IO is te 107th most popular hero, jugg is only the 6th.
107 > 6
I KNOW RIGHT
RIGGED
RIGGED
yay the muppets are back
last year i think you got like 10,000
plus you only get 2500 points for getting the winner correct so idc much about it
so it will be cooler if they win
i think DC are still the underdogs in the grand finals against wings
i'd rather see DC win even though i put wings in my compendium
probably not
at starladder, Arteezy completely destroyed a quas exort invoker as ursa mid
ursa almost always goes mid in pro games
ursa
keenan what do the people at gameworld think of the loud yelling of the TI games you're streaming
and depends if i can get my io game in shape
idk depends what it looks like
arcana vote results and film contest winner coming soon
like with puck or qop ganks
it can work if you get an early lead
i think their whole plan was win teamfights and push with TB
sumail needs to be on a late game core
brewnaster is a bad hero
yeah idk if you saw universe's void play game one but it looked like he was choking so hard
even if you lose you picked jakiro and fucked with them
the jakiro pick game 2 is whaqt did it
misery looks so exhausted
the 19 year old from russia
resolution
reso is so good
dc are the best avengers
now i have no idea who will win
i was almost sure EG would win against Wings if they got to grand finals
SUNSFAN
not for one player
no repeat champion
what a game
NIOCE BKB RESOLUTION
its the best you can do for all in play
and fear has rapier
only slark has buyback
4 buybacks on EG plus mega creeps
that was tense
HOLY SHIT
beast master rat
probably but whats the point if skadi slow gets re-applied so frequently anyway
ye he keeps getting kited with ghost scepters
you can tell it doesnt matter because eg still won the fight without him lol
doesnt matter if he's dead
actually no brewmaster is useless anyway
GG
SHIT
tide is basically a support at this point
the fact that kunkka is more farmed than tide is a good sign
it's a lot faster
it lets you run twitch streams without web browser and flash
you should really get the livestreamer command line tool
because thats probably why
ronald are you watching youtube
they got ursa later lol
in the ravage
if ursa didnt have aghs he would have died too
shit that ravage
did anyone on DC buyback?
cuz eg has no other carry
they win if they kill TB one more time
and a tier 3
they did get a TB buyback
if too many people from DC die here they will lose their buildings
i mean you can see how fast terrorblade pushes the base
good thing brew is exact opposite of that
EG usually loses when sumail isn't on a late game carry mid
of course
2nd only to artstyle
ppd is probably like the best dazzle player
because both saved him there
the health swap or the shallow grave is bullshit
idk maybe
i think it just lets him use it during disables
only if ursa has aghs
i really want DC to win but im still worried, EG  just needs one good team fight to even out the DC's building advantage
Base*
And if eg wins one fight they can easily push the back really fast
Idk i like EGs teamfights a lot better
I hate brewmaster cuz i was forced to play like 15 games with him for a challenge
It was pretty cool too bad any hero could have done that with blink dagger not just brew master
Brew master is a shitty hero
Idk terrorblade is pretty strong
I don't want EG to win
In fantasy draft i was going to bet on EG winning the series but i forgot to do it
Farm
Either team can win with wombo combo regardless of fanr
But in worried about mid JAKIRO lategame
This game is closer than the first
Ugh?
Mid
Miss jakiro
HOLY SHIT JAKIRO PICK
Which rayman
At gameworld?
After that I'll play
Probably more like 9 or 10
I don't think the grand finals will be over by eight
O
I might just play solo queue tomorrow
Why do you get bonus 30
Ronald can you play dota tonight
I also need to bet 2000 tokens before tomorrow night
I need to get all the summer skins before they run out
Ronald are you going to be gone before that
Keenan when do you get home
Watch dota with me Ronald
DC 1-0
🐸
Thanks for asking Keenan
Yes
Overwatch is just a tf2 rip off
You can play mccree any time
Why aren't you watching
Yes
Also universe mainly keeps doing shit chronos
Eg is choking so much
https://twitter.com/TheDanidem/status/764424282416025600
Phantom lancer concept art
It was there the whole time
https://i.redd.it/7wulolfq94fx.jpg
Yeah embers name is Xin, earth spirits name is Kaolin, and storm spirits name is Raijin
Panda
Oh wait brew master
Idk
I think all the spirits might be
Ember spirit
PL is very similar to what i think monkey King will be like
No one expected valve to actually make monkey King but it was a rumored hero that they were working on back in dota 1.
No one expected it because after the phantom lancer rework they basically combined him with monkey king
His intro video is almost as cool as wyverns was
Voiced by mccree
Ronald sounds like this is the new morphling
Probably new comic
His lore might be based off that then
I don't even know what to do we've never gotten a truly new hero before
No one expected this
Ask Ronald he's the mccree expert
Really?
So unexpected
Holy fuck
https://youtu.be/guGFT27SavM
No winner if fanatic and DC plays wings
Yay wings 2-0.
This is just like ti5
No they are one game away
But i predicted wings to win the whole thing so well see
I hope it's DC though
Wings will go to grand finals, eg will fall to lower and play the winner of DC/Fanatic which will def be DC and grand finals will either be EG or DC vs wings
One more and ez 5000 points
Yaaaaas wings won first game
ronald if wings win this series against EG i get 5000 points for my bracket predictions instead of 2000
you guys arent helping
lol you can subscribe to a duct tape purchase
i feel like i really need some ducttape
i should actually buy that
shit
i dont want a big wallet
whats an example of something fancier
what about this one https://www.amazon.com/Alpine-Swiss-Leather-Slimfold-Wallet/dp/B00MC1Q25C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8
not sure
how come all these leather wallets are 10-15 dollars, does that mean it's not real leather?
im kind of tempted to get one like this https://www.amazon.com/Blocking-Wallet-Minimalist-Money-Pocket/dp/B01FJ8RB3Q/ref=sr_1_21?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1471032429&sr=1-21&nodeID=7147441011&keywords=wallet
i hate shopping in actual stores
is this a good wallet https://www.amazon.com/Calvin-Klein-Leather-Bookfold-Size/dp/B001AI9ZD4/ref=sr_1_31?s=apparel&ie=UTF8&qid=1471032429&sr=1-31&nodeID=7147441011&keywords=wallet
look at this shit
i almost never buy their pastries but still
starbucks also has pastries and stuff, and vanilla shakes
no i drink tea
i transferred all the money to one card using the online app but i still keep the other ones because they look cool
thats the price range
i literally have 3 starbucks gifts cards in there
cuz i had no where else to put the sticker


ive had mine since 8th grade but it's obviously worn and one of the card pockets is about to rip
i think my existing wallet is leather but i cant really tell
whats a good price range for a real leather wallet
lol i forgot about that
i already do that
ew no
this is why im just your normal stupid wallet consumer
wow you guys are like Shawn forom psych i was only looking at the wallet
no thats just a random reviewers picture showing how big this wallet it
no why would i use that
what's amex
i bet keenan has been having the same fantasy
lol heres a picture of the wallet that i sent you the review of
my bi wallet is already kind of fat
my current one is bi but has an extra flap for the id card only

i would get a purse
if it fits in my pocket
my current one is almost dead
i need wallet advice
do you guys want to help me buy a wallet on amazon
doesnt look anythink like him
just look at him with his demon goat eyes
riki    is so cute he's like a little mouse
id's say you aren't taking full advantage of the situationhere
if skirts are allowed why didnt you wear a skirt
you should have worn a chase bank t-shirt
and if they say yes, say hold on brb
you should ask if they'd let you wear shorts if you shaved your legs
women have nicer looking legs yo
you  should have just not worn pants at all
i see you're using your last day to your advantage
guns make you fat
i think dota players just look younger because they are healthier because dota makes you healthy
some dude on TNC has children
each dota team maybe has one or two plyaers under 20, if that
thats literally the same as dota
https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3n6mb4/csgo_average_age_of_players_teams/
the game is only 3 years older or so
how come smash players arent fat
i still dont think thats the reason they are fat
is the esport older thouhg
the older ones almost always played dota 1
yes there are like 30% of the players under 20
id say 50%
a lot
dota is an older game than cs
thats not true
in dota there are like 2 fat people
when i watched the csgo major i noticed a lot more overweight players then ive seen in dota or smash
also it's weird that in csgo the players at least are a lot more overweight
lol
i mean players spotlight
aww htat mvp QO interview
this was a great interview with her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysI4RpotUgQ
no
anyway keenan it's possibly to catch up on the games for any tournament without spoilers using https://www.reddit.com/r/dotavods
if you used grindr you must be secretly a giant hairy man too
is it a grindr hook up
is this a tinder hookup then
sounds like fun although it's funny that you said after breaking up with megan you wouldn't date for like 6months
indianapolis?
that sounds like a whole lot of time with just one person who you likely met recently
games go on for 12 hours
why does that take all day
whats pt 2
why, working?
complete with dota mmr elo's
lol
this guys posts these rankings for every event

Underlord is one ugly fellow

fear isnt having a part of this kids games
iceiceice with the 5000 health morphling
i think everyone is fired
how does pitlord have +500 damage
depends who she is keenan
i think QO's name is mvp ti champions
maybe the guy who picked iceiceice
bulldog and unvierse lol
wow he's a big hero
lol
lol iceiciecie with the memes
beacuse someone's in game name is big dick lanm
must be iceiceice
big dick lanm lol
probably riot
i wonder if it's going to be pitlord or riot
fear aint h aving it
he wants to secure  the win
pit lord chants
ya.
because they are twins
QO is pretty cool though
lol
yeah
why is no one picking synderen
as he was walking away he muttered "i cant hear anything"
a guy picked dendi and EE walked up
EE lul
the pro players are surprisingly cool about t his
yeah
thats a lot of pro players
even the announcer is in it
the banter just keeps getting better and btter
this banter is pretty good
lol
nope
i didnt even like soylen on facebook
ok slacks is pretty savage too
holy shit kaci is savage
shh he cant text at a date
at manila there were guys too
literally all of the are girls
keenan the cosplay competition would be just your thing
rekt
wow
idk i liked roshan better for originality
nice to see someone cosplaying something thats not cm or wop
roshan is also good
sexy sf
the arc warden is pretty good
usually there are some guys who do this
how come they are all girls
pcp lol
literal omni bitch
"who fed qop" lol
i just like watching it to see what chat says
you're not even there
ronald you get uncomfortable too easily
its just a cosplay competition
a lot of the time chat also says really politically inccorect stuff which is funny
yeah
i also really l ike the wutface emote
honestly no matter how bad the segment is chat always makes it better
the chat is hillarious during these segments
that kid cheated wtf
or film contest winners
oh yeah arcana vote might be revealed too
i know and the segment that i said was good earlier was basically pro players making fun of her
she did one segment earlier that was really good but most arent
godz just said he went all in on TNC instead of DC so i guess he dropped down
godz
i think goz is still higher
no the leaderboards take a whioe to update
i should have done that
tobi https://twitter.com/TobiWanDOTA/status/763920663807561729
lol https://twitter.com/Leafeator/status/763920761769689088
like remember iceice, he originally played on big god at DAC
no their players were known just split up on smaller chinese teams
they legit came out of nowhere
except tnc
no one really came out of nowhere you just dont pay attention
wings
mvp and fnatic
sounds like they really enjoy playing each other
this w33 interview sounds like DC is the type of team to stick together after TI
🐸
lul
and before archon he was the highest mmr player in NA
he was the best player on archon
archon
WHERES PURGE WITH tHE NICE WEATHER
NICE WEATHER OVER HERE
because ush is their primary sub
you have to take out two players
waiting to be subbed in
lol slacks
"timbersaw baby, timbersaw"
yeah
look at him
im so hard right now
that initiation
wow
me too so you just torrent the book
greed
uh huh
are you just going to ignore the fact that mirana is op ronald
mirana has a 60% winrate and you aren't calling her op
he only has a 52% winrate
now he's only picked by the teams that have really good timber players
not really, he's not as commonly picked as he was
my timbersaw idol
moo is so good wow
godz and winter are panel people but i want them to be casting
im also pissed godz or winter isn't paired with LD and instead maut is for whatever reason
im sad this is cap and blitz's last cast
i just want everything to be a 2-0 so i can sleep sooner
lol
which is what puppey is but obviously he didnt work out
they would be good at drafthing they just need a strong in-game leader
all of them are very smart theoretical dota minds
or bulba
i think aui or EE would captain
i mean that was a good team
c9 2.0
good team
it just needs to be EE, aui, bulba, pie, rtz
puppey is too controlling, selfish, and stubborn
kemal, matt, puppey, all are bad management
they really suck
secret need to reform without puppey and the rest of secret's management
notail wasn't sure about them staying together which means probably a change
yeah probably you can tell from og's exit interview
also since they've done a good job at keeping the all star match a secret it's probably going to be something good
they deserve it so much after getting booted from secret after winning shanghai
which is amazing
if they win they get top 4
i just remember notail and rotk laying on the floor together
probably but all star matches are supposed to be fun not try hard
while everyone was playing around with techies/tusk/ and tiny toss
as leigon
it was the one where ferrari went really trihard
because you could see them coaching
rotk vs notail
no that one was really funny
no idea thats why im curious to see what it's going to be
i think it might have been an all star match for some other tournament
actually idk if that was TI match
right/?
that was the one where techies was revealed
it is
the all star match is after this too, ti all star matches are always good
yeah same
dc are playing amazing right now and even if the games are stomps it's still fun to watch the good plays
the first dc ehome game was really good
you should definitely tune in
oh yeh
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/4xaxxu/crowd_stfu/
i see
"Working"
are you just working really late or something
he's standing behind the panel in the crowd and one guy had a sign that said hail santa so pyrion held it up but then it changed to hail satan
lol i think pyrion flax accidentally held up a hail satan sign
i only used one liquid card i think and it was matumbaman
i put 2 dc players in my draft
all of the games were lower bracket
ll this kaci segment was great
and won in 30 minutes
so keenan, DC picked venge and naga in their draft and ehome drafted to counter a carry naga and even the casters thought ehome won the draft.
but DC threw them off by running venge carry and naga support
the casters are completely ignoring as they should but it's loud as fuck
the crowd is like randomly howling
this is so weird
HOLY SHIT SUNSTRIKE PRO
no tou just need to see it and tell me what you think
WOOOOOOO
i dont understand
like dogs
lol wtf the crowd is like howling
so you understand hero versatility
keenan you need to see this DC draft
"This was hilarious but I did feel bad for him.
Imagine yourself in his shoes.
You fought all your life to get the respect you thought you deserve

People laugh at your hobby and how you try to play video games "professionally"

There's this thing called liquidpedia you know
My fantasy draft
Fuck you
Damnit liquid
they are pretty good at the hero
its ok liquid will pick rubick more if they win
although jerax might be plying it
i own his rubick set in game
kuroky is one of the most famous rubick players
his coaching won EG the last TI
after being knocked out
oh shit bulba is coaching liquid now
he's known for being extremely laid back and humble
how so
who's that
i love how "niche pick medusa" is a perk listed on fnatic's team intro
for the all-star match
she's going to do a real timbersaw cosplay tonight
the last remaining hero to be ported over to dota 2
it's going to be hype
i think pitlord will either be revealed today or on saturday before the final
akke is such a solid dude
lol
he was just in a two year slump
except for demon, he's pretty experienced
i think it was their first lan alltogether
oh yeah, they werent even really a team before this
looks uncomfortable with his mom there lol
poor moo
momma moo!
and the player named mu
too confusing with the player named moon
woo
moo interview
most of the viewers know them by their screen names but a lot of these guys are all good friends in real life so occassionally they use real names
sometimes they use real names
call names?
team revenge is really getting revenge
its more like a ...gg because of how long it's taking tnc to call it
pro escape
wow how did they not kill sk there
rip
lol the position 5 wyvern is more farmed than TNC's void
he tunes in for 5 seconds which is enough to tell that it's gg
yeah
just find out where he's living and move in right next to him
you need to find out where he is now and say by to him
and the guy who told you to be quiet
yup
and you'll say you need to say bye to all your roommates
just tell them to come on sunday
they came so far
idk probably like 5pm eastern
yes
i'll be kind of tired and TI will still be going on though
probably
i'l be back friday night
https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/7/7f/Dkseer_attack_10.mp3
holy shit demon almost stole that
tnc has a really good draft for rosh though
decently early yeah
ronald you just dont like him because you play morphling
https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/c/c0/Dkseer_kill_01.mp3
lol i just checked dark seers voice lines, he literally has 5 or 6 that are racist against round heads
faceless void is awesome
thats not true
hes the purple short guy with a pointy head
dark seer is racist against people who have round heads
his most played hero
moo is dark seer
who did you predict ronald
yes it's game three
just like mei, a lot of people find wyvern annoying
and only makes the immune to physical damage, not all damage
cold embrace is basically mei's ice heal thing but can be used on other people
he lived from because wyvern used cold embrace on him
nice arrow from w33
but usually that is correlated with winning
i mean not win but perform well
i get rewards if they win
w33ha and misery are in my fantasy draft for today
yes
except for minute 0 where both runes are bounty runes and they are special bounty runes which just give a flat 100 gold
one of the psawns will always be a bounty rune which just gives gold an xp (the gold and xp varies depending on the game time, you get more the later the game goes)
two runes spawn every two minutes
no it temporariliy lowers cooldowns and mana costs
bounty, dd, invis, haste, illusion, and arcane
yea butminute 0 is the exception
exepcially this early, you can striaght up buy a bottle or something before the creeps spawn with that kind of money
which is why kuku still went for the rune since it's a lot of money for him
but alchemist's greevils greed multiplies that by 3 or 4
at 0 minutes bounty runes spawn.
the bounty runes give 100 gold at the beginning
they killed kuku at the rune
it is a lot of money for some guy in his late teens or early/mid twenties , likely without a college degree, just playing video games
plus you get bonuses for winning prize money of course
players on EG or something make 6 figures a year since that team is so successful
but when a team gets better results and more sponsorships they start making more
when DC first formed i heard each player made like 40k per year
the best teams are making like 6 figures per player
oh yeah
i cant imagine the pressure
winner gets 400k more
this single game is a 400,000 dollar match
i guess i dont like many things on facebook and you dont have a lot of fb friends so my likes are weighted a lot
oh lol
i present at that conference last semester
why do you have a mucsc ad on your facebook
you'll be so amazed by that game
also keenan at some point you really need to watch a VOD of ehome vs EG game 1
game 3 hype
i was wondering that at first but then i forgot that clockwerk's voice isn't actually coming from his mouth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=757Op_1Ejz0
did you see the guy who made a clockwerk puppet
thats the type of cosplay i would do

lol the io cosplay
and casted the newbie stream last year
purge is the guy who does the weather but he also makes really good dota guides on youtube
there was actually one tournament where dire had a 70% winrate or something which is what ronald is making fun of but they patched that pretty quickly
lol
especially if you know all the storylines
at TI the teams always play super well it's always sad no matter who loses
momma moo looks so happy
that graphi is a roller coaster
but the weakness of AA's other skills late game balance it out
its probably one of the best ults in the whole game
it does some damage every second, prevents you from healing, and automatically kills the enemy heroes caught in it when their hp goes below 12%
Ancient apparitions ultimate is a global aoe nuke that you have to aim but it's range is global
that was almost a great escape
wow
silencer's aghs upgrade makes his global silence last longer and it applies aoe damage on it
which is why alch's networth went down and silencer's went up
so alch gifted an aghs to the silencer
ember spirit just bought one
it's like a 6000 gold item that gives +300 damage but when you die you drop it on the groound and the other team can potentially pick it up
you know about rapiers?
some beautiful shit
THAT EARTH SPLITTER RP
THE SPLITTER
i want dc to win because Moo's mom and dad came to this event despite not knowing anything about dota and i dont want them to be sad
https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/1/17/Timb_ally_01.mp3
https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/dota2.gamepedia.com/1/10/Timb_rare_01.mp3
timbersaw has the best voice lines in my opinion
when i do, i play him support and devote all my money to giving my team items
i still never play him
i never played him lol
it took me like 300 hours in dota before i realized alchemist wasnt actually the ogre
hes such a cool character too
he's a little goblin riding on top of the ogre
also if you cant see, alchemist isn't actually the ogre
so he starts buying his whole team an aghs
you'll hear casters talking a lot about aghanim's upgrades when it becomes super late game and alchemist is shitting too much money to buy stuff for himself anymore
so it's more valuable than a normal aghs because normally an item that doesnt give very many stats is kind of a waste of a slot on carries who need a lot of items anywawy
alchemist's aghs upgrade is that he can use the aghs on an allied hero and it gifts them the aghs but the gifted aghs doesnt actually take up an item slot
most heroes in the games have a possible aghs upgrade
it's a 4200 gold item that doesnt give very many stats (you dont really buy it for the stats) but it gives special abilities to some heroes and/or buffs the ult of them.
it depends on the hero what effect it has.
sort of like hidden power in pokemon
are you familiar with aghanims scepter
actually yes, but only aclhemist can
if he's not like 5k gold ahead of the next carry he's not doing well enough
it's balanced by the fact that alchemist needs a lot more gold to compete against other carries
at max combo he's getting like 75 gold per creep instead of the normal 40-50
the more last hits you get in a row, the more each one becomes worth
which basically lets you combo creep last hits
his passive ability is called greevils greed
which normally happens
thats an exemple of an offlaner getting sacked
yeah if i remember correctly, timber was a solo offlane against a trilane
but definitely not void
tracer is arguably sexier than weaver
faceless void and weaver are much cooler than tracer though
basically
not mana or position or anything else
faceless void only reverts the hp from 2 seconds ago
weaver's ult is called timelapse which brings you back 5 seconds in time, hp, mana, and position included
weaver is more like tracer though
it also moves his position
at max level, every 6 seconds he can time walk which reverts the last 2 seconds of damage
kind of
faceless void is also a really well designed hero
faceless void is pretty good at not having a face
just like Axe is pretty good with axe
he's pretty good at silencing
his primary use is silencing
everytime he's near a kill he permanently steals 2 intelligence from them
yeah he's a pretty cool hero
he's the pink hero on the left side of TNC's hero icons
silencer looks sort of like a priest
so DC have three heroes with really big teamfight ults, but TNC has a silencer whose ult is a global silence that lasts for 6 seconds or so and it can really counter DC's teamfight ults
oh yeah i forgot about silencer
earth splitter is personally my favorite looking ability in the game
and eldar titan with earth splitter (it's like fissure in pokemon but instead of 100% hp damage it does 30%-50% of your hp as damage depending on the level
also keep an eye on the void with chronosphere
yeah but i would keep an eye on magnus because he can make really big and flashy plays with his ult
zarya's ult is more like dark seer's vacuum
rp is a hard stun
sort of, zarya's ult still lets you use abilities and attack
while they are stunned from the RP
so generally you RP heroes to group them toegether and skewer them towards your team
he also has an ability called skewer which does what it sounds like,  he skweres people on his horn and pushes them where he wants them to go
his ult called reverse polarity is an aoe stun that pulls everyone caught in it to one place
magnus
he has an ability called reactive armor which is a passive that gives him more armor and more health regen the more people hit him
holy shit timber almost lived there
there are some really funny but rare dota voice lines
it kind of illustrates how many more voice lines dota heroes have than overwatch
you have to rewind like 10 minutes from live
slark interview https://youtu.be/H08ZEAp5a2M?t=2h16m23s
they'll proabbly put the video on youtube in a couple hours
holy shit that slark interview was amazing
that is known as sunsfanning and may or may not actually happen
before TI, nobody knew about TNC and before TI, DC were well known but underperforming a lot and no one expected them to do this well here
i hope thats enough explanation of the teams
oh and i forgot to say that W33ha and Misery were kicked from Secret immediately after they got 1st place at the Winter Major in Shanghai.
Which is why it's great that they got their revenge and sent secret to the lower bracket of TI during the group stage

his face itself is a meme
he's also a pretty funny guy and the shit he does and says often become memes
the team is owned by SUNSfan who got his name by co-owning the most successful dota youtube channel, dotacinema
DC is an american team made up of 4 europeans and 1 american (Moo who plays offlane).
W33ha (mid) and misery (support) were kicked from secret in an unprofessional fashion and joined resolution (carry) and saksa (support) at the last minute for revenge
in probably 10 minutes
all new players except for demon and most people thought demon was washed out
they came out of nowhere besides demon and no one expected them to do well
so anyway TNC is a team of 4 random Pinoy players who are new to the scene plus Jimmy "demon" ho who is their captain.
Demon moved to the SEA region after almost 2 years of an insuccessful dota career in north america.
he was about to give up on dota until he coached and captained the team of brand new players through the open qualifiers and the regional qualifiers for TI.
or aoe damage
they will become really tanky and TNC have extremely little wave clear
it will get harder and harder for TNC to win the later it gets because of naga illusion spam
he used one of his best escapes (The waveform) to initiate there and didnt have it off cooldown to escape
it's kuku but yeah
and she can just split push with them while using the radiance to burn the creep wave down
eventually each of her illusions will be as hard to kill as a normal hero
naga is almost getting to the point where she is really strong
look at dat avg kda
proof http://www.dotabuff.com/players/83844576
ronald would have killed all 5 and still gotten out
this guy isn't as good as ronald as morphling
he has 3 different escapes, 4 if you count his blink dagger, and 5 if you count his 4 second stun
escape master
yeah thats morphling for ya
like the 3 sentence version
do you want some backstory on each of these teams
so they transitioned from early game to mid-game well
thats how it should end up
and the farm order is 1, 2, 3
yeah notice how they passed the batrider
that looked bad for TNC but DC just spent a lot of money for two buybacks to hold that
as you just saw
however the bat and morphling can fly up hill and get pick offs with lasso
because DC has so much wave clear
its really hard for TNC to get creeps up the highground
it is a little bit but if TNC make any mistakes pushing highground it's easy for DC to come back off of it
their plan is to stall the pushes until their naga can get farmed enough to carry them
they are good at stopping pushes with all those abilities
DC drafted a lot of anti-push heroes like Kotl with his giant aoe light blast that kills creeps, tusk which is long range shards nuke, and dragon knight with his breathe fire
their own late game carry morphling is not good against naga in the late game
so this is TNC's best chance
but she really sucks before 30-35 minutes
probably top 3
naga siren is one of the strongest heroes late game
part of the reason TNC is so aggressive early too is because they are playing against a Naga siren
which is why they can push so fast and why bat and morphling can do a lot mor e damage now
so their team is 5 ranged heroes and drow is passively increasing the damage of all of them
the other think about TNC's draft keenan is the drow ranger buffs the damage of all ranged heroes on their team globally
i think so
because they might not know they are roshing
but not completely because they still ahve morphling for late game insurance
this is kind of one of those strategies
there are some strategies where you dont pick a lategame hero and focus on dominating the early game
however if TNC wins this game really early then it wont matter
so TNC needs to make sure their real cores get farm too
he becomes more of an initiator late game than a real damage dealer
bat does a lot of damage with his firefly right now, but late game magic damage falls off and he's more useful for just his ultimate which can drag a hero after him
because those are the two heroes that really do the damage late game
so notice how bat is top networth right now but TNC needs to be careful that their morph (pos 1) and their drow (pos 2) still get farm
in pub games it's more common
he can be played mid or offlane too but it's rare in pro games
the supports are almost always the bottom 4 on the list
it's a rough ranking of farm priority
you can normally tell by the networth list on the side
yes
so the fact that batrider has the most networth in the game right now is really good for TNC
but more priority than supports
they have a '3' farm priority so after the carry and the mid
but the fact that he got a solo kill is really good for someone like him because usually offlaners are sacked
well not mid heroes but offlane heroes
those types of heroes are typically really reliant on xp more than gold
but batrider is typically a mid or offlane hero
because it's basically free money
so when you have a bounty hunter you want to get 3 or 4 people in one kill
bounty hunter's ultimate is an ability that gives people who assist in kills a lot more gold
so the total xp gain is the same but the gold gain increases when you have more heroes helping
if someone assists you, tyou get less xp but still the same amount of gold and the person who helped you is also getting some gold
if it's just a solo kill, the killer gets all the xp and a good amount of gold
so there are pros and cons to having multiple people invovled in kill vs just a solo kill
second most picked hero this tournament
batman so strong
which is a bad sign
but before batrider killed beast without any help
the venge just ganked to help the batrider get another kill
like this venge
normally kills happen in the early game because a support or someone ganks
but it's bad because that beast master got solo killed
no it's about average
no it just means some one peed inside of him
ronald stop spewing bullshit, morphling isn't water he's just blue-skinned
yes
his first skill is a pretty big nuke (nukes and magic damage is better early game than late game) and it's also an escape so he can survive in fights
late game but he's better in early fights than a lot of carries
you can also control the camera yourself and highlight things and read abilities, sometimes thats useful for learning
if you watch the game in the dota client you can see it
they usually show the order of the draft on the screen too but they are doing a special production value for TI And dont have room for it
heres the breif explanation of drafting phase
http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Game_modes#Captains_Mode
he's one of my favorite hero designs
i know
oh i thought it was battleborn
keenan every other gaming community unanimously agrees that dota 2 has by far the best memes
you need that up too
what about twitch chat
you can take away the online list with the person icon in the top right
what do you mean
oh
what did they do
i did it before
i cant figure out where to find faction winrates on dotabuff
nope
she doesn't know much about dota
she works for some seattle news station and literally only is associated with dota during TI
she's not a real dota personality
i mean there's a real reason why and it's not because of her sex
she asks really boring and typical questions
yeah i dont like Kaci's interviews
idk
demon is a player who was just interviewed
are you talking about demon lol
ronald did you watch Spotlight
i dont care about overwatch hats
i know you're kidding but im still trying to find what the actual stats are because im curious
thats not true
but there are other advantages and disadvantages beyond that
if you choose pick order, you pick first pick or second pick and the other team is left with choosing radiant or dire
the winner of the coin flip choses side or ppick order.
if you choose side you can pick radiant or dir, and the other team chooses wether they pick first or second
at the start of a match the teams flip a coin
by watching the panel discuss the draft
http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/Main_Page match ticker site
https://discordapp.com/invite/0Pj5D1QKnY7t1L9K
keenan aside from r/learndota2 you should also join the dota2 discord channel and use the #ti6 and #new-to-dota2 channels
Only 2 players on navi are has beens
Fanatic is more like 4 sheep plus dictator mushi
No TNC are the Peruvians of the east
The panel with redeye in between matches kind of does this too
Some of his videos for some teams may still be relevant
Although the teams ant their players and history change every year
The same guy made videos like this for most of the teams last year
Keenan watch this https://youtu.be/r_L4Q_FRcyY
Specifically harambe.
Not any other gorilla
They also need a gorilla pokemon to build awareness for harambe
No

Coral reefs are endangered you know
They needed.more coral reef pokemon
Aww yeah innards out boys
Favorite Pokemon
What are the first two
Oh good thing it looks like three dicks
Looks like a dick
More like MoreLUL
They are like marbles
I don't like its eyes
A land where mice use their own tails as hover boards
i do a lot of development work from home
but thats only counting time actually in the lab
during the summer it's probably more like 15 not including these recent few weeks
during the semseter im required to get at least 10 hours per week because of the scholarship
normally you get paid with scholarships or grants or not at all
only because we are contracting with noblis
but for this 2-week data collection thing it's a salary
during the summer i need to get grants
i only get paid because of a scholarship and even then it' not a real salary
you wont get paid much
but usually each station has a person for 2.5hrs and there are 4 subjects per station per day
no there are 2 other eye tracking stations
and answer questions
i only have to input the final decision and start them out
but if they are taking a long time to do a comparison theres not much to do
as well as calibrate the eye trackers
but during a trial i have to input all their responses and help them use the software
they do trials for basically 2.5 hours stragiht each and there are only small breaks in between
i just cant really use headphones because i need to be able to hear what they tell me to input
ive gotten so good at helping the subjects and calibrating them i can do it while i read or do other things
yes but normally it's pretty relaxed
no  i still have to run subjects after that until 6
assisting
but tomorrow icant
usually im running subjects from 8-6pm which lets me multitask a little bit
im giving a workshop from 8-12:30
i cant decide if i should stay up for the rest of this series
esp considering your price point those are your best options
i dont think you can go wrong either way
both the corsair case or the rosewill case are good choices
i doubt they will know what they are talking about

at least my fantasy isnt ruined because mathmatically they were ahead
ehome definitely threw that
ugh
4000 gold wasted inventory slot for -15sec respawn time
its literally 3 secs per charge
why the fuck would you keep that item especially if its at 5 charges or less
oh yeah definitely he also kept bloodstone until 60 minutes
iceiceice could euls that though
dagons and eblade on mirana and sd won that game
ASDFFFFFFO$J@#qwdwe
and why did jugg ult a creep wave
why did timber go so far out of the base
ehome were mathematicalyl ahead the entire game
why is this so tense
ew bloodlust golems
a 5 charge bloodstone aint doing shit for him
iceiceice should really replace his bloodstone with dagono 5 or something
chakrams automatically come back after a certain distance
we really need to do sd morph more
this SD is such a big BM counter
id call it evenly matched
uuugh
dont lul them yet this game is extremely even
but in general, two good performances across two games would get as many points as one good performance in one game and arguably the former indicates a stronger player
actually in the group stage it wowuld work since everyone plays equal number of games
but then you would get a lot of points for one good performance in one game even though the team got eliminated and didnt play any more than 1
yes
but yiu should watch noobfromua highlights for game 2
2-0
ugh ehome are losing a 10k lead
wings are really flashy in teamfights
it was amazing
you should have seen game 2
wings
this match is so hype with the USA vs EHOME chants
hoooly shit wings
how is this so back and forth
mvp picks it a lot
it's QO's signature
but at least either way its a happy outcome for me
i should really stop betting against the teams i want to win'
im just not going to root for either team and just hope for good games
i like all their players so much
i predicted wings in my bracket and fantasy but in my heart i want mvp to win
raven is tnc
mvp wings and eg ehome are both gokng to be amazing series
oh no another biblethump interview
no memes sign
this overview and graphs section is the new in game ui
splittling your bets let that is safer but you get less
lol fata almost walked off without shaking hands
axe and antimage is really good against morph
if newbee had the shadow demon they could try to win with morphling illusion spam and splkt push
at least i think i did
im so glad i chose matu
last night i was debating between my silver hao or silver matumbaman card
i believe in liquid for my predictions
yay i can finally watch
Dst
Day graph

It's looks like newbee had a pretty giant lead by the end
Goddamnit
But Keenan liquid is Europe's last hope
That feeling when Keenan gets to watch more TI than you

Fine 3 sea 2 Na 3 China and 1 eu
3 sea, 1 NA, 3 China, and 2 EU
So there are two EU teams
I'm pretty sure they are NA when losing
I also forget if DC is EU when they are winning or NA when they are winning

secret literally did that in their game yesterday
how is that cheese
watch a video on that one
higher quality and stuff
that corsair case is probably better
how can anyone hate og
you really need to see build videos specific to your case first
i wouldn't recommend buying a case in the store
so buying separate fans lets you customize more
but they always have many different kinds like silent fans or high airflow and different sizes
so most manufacturers of cases also make case fans and they usually just put their own brand of case fan pre-installed in their cases
well not always
the case fans that you buy separately are always better quality anyway
ronald you can always start with one case fan and monitor temps and if it's too hot buy an extra
but if you want really stylish look at nxzt and phanteks but they are more expensive
nice looking
they make nice cases
i really like corsair
they are all good brands except thermaltake
kuku is so adorable
you need overall ventillation
the graphics card has a fan but it will only be drawing in warm air and outputting warmer air if the inside of the case is hot
but the motherboard and hard drive produces a lot of heat which dont have fans
depends on how hot your parts run
PURGE WITH THE WEATHER
why hasn't he been on a good team for two years and now this
jimmy demon ho
he lost it when he bought a rapier
no
the cores on og didnt havebuyback since ember bought a rapier and tnc just went for throne
standing ovation for TNC
FUCK
the bottom 4 not bottom 5 and then it's close
ok maybe not
you can basically add the bottom 5 together and get drow's networth
everyong after darkseer is poor as fuck compared to the top
the wealth gap in this game
holy shit
they switched lanes halfway through and put drow bot
it was ogre tiny io vs venge dazzle drow
because it was an aggro tri top
either team can rat and oor push really fast
but they traded raxes thats all
they just got a pick off on ember
i dont think tnc ever had the lead numerically
except got nothing
tnc is trying to throne
wtf
thats a pretty good difference
going on
do you have a good deal?
but it's a lot more xpensive and is two slots
its good stats for drow
no you have to toggle it on and off to get both effects
ty miracle for ez fantasy points
flying ogre lol
neither did but solo killing a huskar as ember is really impressive
these plays from moon and miracle are unbelievable
so much damage
i mean drow and venge
plus a drow and huskar omg
ugggggggghhh
huskar dazzle
ugh
they even lost the first open qualifier round
yes
he singlehandedly captained and taught a random team of new sea players to 12th place
i have so much respect for demon now whether he wins or loses this
tiny wisp
yay og classic
along with the new end game stats screen
i think on thursday pitlord will be revealed
notail has a very faint mustache
they can also look up
and the timers and stuff, because the stage is projected just like last year
they see the icons on the stage
it will be really sad when liquid loses too
liquid is also like that
they are very humble.
they just dont talk and win
og is the only fan favorite team where i actually like all of the players
this is going to be really sad if og loses
everyone knows blue + yellow = green
someone probably peed in it
never predict the predicted ronald
It's more similar to pokemon how things are classified than overwatch or league
Yes
Like compared to overwatch it's way more flexible
Dota is not as strict in terms of meta as other games
You learn most of this from experience, like warding and what heroes play what roles
Pos 1 heroes take longer to get strong but once they do they are the strongest
Farm is both
And xp
Yes
Not just take the least but require the least too.
Pos 5 heroes can do a lot with not much money
Pos 5 players take the least
Pos 1 players take the most farm
Supports and cores are sorted into positions based on how much farm they require
It's support and core
There's no offense or defense
Cincinnati is literally 2.5 hours away
that costs money and its risky
do you think we can fly with 200,000 dollars of eyetracking equipment
we drove
im just at a hotel dude
yes
watch ti
drink my soylent
if it were up to me i would stay home
yesterday i had dinner with some other researchers and the head of the fbi latent print unit
yeah but usually its not just us
i just go to the hotel but have to go out for dinner again
and shows stats
and he draws shit
purge has a giant monitor that he uses to highlight and explain plays and decisons
weatherman purge is my favorite new feature
og tnc
its like using zenyatta ult while your team is at full hp and no one is damaging them
it was just universe the rest of the team wasnt there yet
i dont they they were focusing them in the chrono
not one, but two oracle ults
like why would you use oracle ult instantly when they get chronoed at full hp
did he purposely throw that fight
chuan used two oracle ults on two heroes with full hp
wtf............
eg can always exploit shadow demon illusions on morph
but they are five seconds
this game is super close
🐸
morphling is being OSfrog
morphling 🐸
zai juked some noobs
ZAW
ZAI WTF
even 3 for 1 i think
as long as they keep killing that timber it's a decent trade because he loses bloodstone charges
this kpii dude is like sand king master
i feel like morphling is only really picked in combination with shadow demon
they make really good cases
i would also look in to the cheaper corsair cases
neither am i but its by far the best value
i dont know whats wrong with the rosewill case
the turtles are better than butterflies
oh yeah
idk alch can give an aghs to all 4 heroes on his team
are you watching it muted
NEWBEE REVERSE 322!
idk i want them or mvp or dc to win
but a eg win here will ruin like half of my upper bracket and half of the lower bracket
no i had secret losing to dc but as long as DC advances the wrong prediction about secret/lgd doesnt matter much
if eg wins it will mess up everything for me.
the only other prediction i got wrong was secret/lgd and that can be recovered if DC beats LGD
goddamnit how is eg coming back
yes
like middle tier
he's semi-popular
no this is the first game ive seen him
or maybe its just some random dude casting frmo his computer at home
i wonder if that russian stream will jump to the english talent at the event in between matches
and are fat
and slow
and both are tanky
yeah both are ideal for close range combat
a team incorrectly going to losers throws everything off entirely
i really need newbee to win this series for my bracket predictions
it's okay you can proabbly read a whole comic during the queue time of a dota game
its literally overwatch, there are heroes and ultimates
it's ok if it's russian, sometimes i find that i can focus more on what's going on in teamfights without the caster sound sometimes
is it called alemalk
whats it called
which stream ?
ok let me find the hitbox stream
goddamnit newbee
or azubu.
whatever
or hitbox.tv
what about douyu.com
is youtube blocked
you could try some chinese stream
all the streams are listed on the trackdota app
that's pretty entertaining
you can at least watch the minimap icons move every 20 seconds in the track dota app
but TI ronald
you arent going to use 500 mb per week when you are at home or on campus
considering you only have like 3 days left in an office space with no wifi you might as well do something with the data you aren't going to use again when you get back home
ronald even if you streamed audio only TI for 4 hours straight your data usage would only increase from 1.8 GB to 1.9GB
doesnt that data expire after 12 months though
i am only on a 6gb plan for one week because my hotel and place last week didnt have good wifi
no that only works for 4gb plans and higher
ronald i have that too and ive passed 2.5 gb twice in two years
although the app lets you see picks and graphcs and minimap
you doont even need the trackdota app to do audio only stream, you can just use this http://audiotwitch.tv/dota2ti/
you can probably assume it's 64kbps audio streeaming which is like 0.48 mb per minute
no
there's an app
and listen to the audio only stream
use trackdota on your phone
just use the r/dota2vods
oh
why dont you have wifi
do you not have wifi
can you not use your phone
they have lobbies just not custom ones i think
they proably have some sort of team matchmaking
like you cant even go into a map by yourself and practice last hits
league is like the most popualr esport and it doesnt even have a replay system or sandbox/custom lobby mode
it's not just stats
but when you look at overwatch and other games like league and HoTS you realize how many features dota actually has that seem like they should be standard but arent
yeah they said they're working on it
but idk that either
the same way as the career profile does
there's not much they can tap into besides the publically avaailble career profiles
because overwatch doesnt provide per match data
it rivals dotabuff or yasp and looks really fancy
purge just did his weatherman stuff with the new end games stats screen that will be debutting soon
i kept bulldog though
yeah and most offlaners are like that which is why i recycled them
he always makes amazing plays but wont earn a lot of fantasy points since he's not a greedy core
yes ehome stomped alliance twice basically
then it's proabbly worth it.
i have a silver moon but id rather use a regular notail/meracle for that team
so if you have a mid or carry it's probably better to use it than an offlaner
so i think even if an offlaner like old eleven does really well early ggame, the other two cores will eventually surpass him in kills and networth
well everyone on ehome is doing well now, not just eleven
my draft for today was iceiceice, old chicken, hao, banana and fly
ugh i shouldn't have recycled my old eleven card.
i recycled it because it was an offlaner player but in this game right now he has more networth than the safelane and mid as sk
ehome mvp and dc
i think ehome is my favorite team right now
https://twitter.com/StatsmanBruno/status/762910164487852033
oh my god they turned the analyst panel into muppets
my gold EE card gave me 5 dust 😃
i think i opened 3 or 4 new card packs after recycling every one that was eliminated
i got a silver matumbaman today
i hope liquid wins
probably not
ugh idk if i should stay up for navi vs liquid
idk now i go to MVP
ESCAPE GAMING GOING TO ESCAPE THE besT OF ONES
http://www.trackdota.com/matches/2558255566
i even changed my reddit flair from liquid  to escape
escape gaming obviously
kick EE -> win TI6
should have kicked EE
well i mean they were supposed to lose but it took lgd 50 minutes longer than it should have
lgd was up like 10-0 in the beginning and have been ahead in networth the entire game but still havent won in 70 min
more like lgd lul
oh my god this game
so  the captain of secret is puppey and the captain of lgd is xiao8.
both are legendary captains who have each won a TI before.
so this is an interesting game because it's elimination and best of 1, loser gets last place and no matter what one of the most legendary captains is going out early
it's targeted towards new competitive viewers or people that dont play dota
usually they do
im kind of mad valve doesnt have a newbie stream this year
its okay alchemist literally shits gold so he can catch up
thats like 10% chance
yea the crit
he also plays offlane which is my fav position
he's playing beastmaster in top lane
he's named after bulbasaur and graduated from UNC
so bulba on secret is my favorite player
because last year and the year before it was gold and purple repectively which looked really nice too
at first i was hesitant about the crimson theme this year but now i really like it
kinda
what do you mean does to the ground
i really like this VR thing
uh huh
are your 3's backwards E's
K BACKWARDS 3 BACKWARDS 3 N A N
you changed your signature
Not eating = easy bucks
So i just learned that my per diem for food is $69 and I've been traveling for 9 days and only have spent $32
Apparently she was windranger
Epicenter
I haven't even seen that part of the opening ceremony though yet i only saw Gabe's part
Yeah so much that i had to check dota 2 Reddit because i didn't realize that was her
He's probably a programmer not a public speaker
I respect him as a billionaire more because of his clothes
Why are his clothes disturbing
Those would be my millionaire clothes too
Wings beat DC too.
2 for 2
HA i was right, mvp would beat og
but when we're actually in game we get similar performance and frame rates
it takes my brother 30 seeconds to boot up dota but it takes me 3 seconds because i have an ssd
and windows defender works well as long as you're not stupid with what you download
i uninstalled norton symantec when i realized it took 5 gb of space
it's lightweight
no i use windows defender
when you download stuff from the internet make sure you do custom  installs onto your seperate  drive
steam lets you put games on multiple drives
for games other than minecraft its more about load times
for minecraft, ssd's make worlds load and render lreally fast because loading chunks is a lot of read operations
but for gaming it only affects load times, so if you dont care about load times and dont do a lot of read/write operations than it's not worth it
ssd is the biggest single performance booster of a computer
if the reviews are good, then yes
so i just checked windows 10 on my laptop is like 60 but thats before I clean up old installations and stuff
Windows will be like 30-40 GB max
That's probably enough for Windows plus the games you play the most
Whatever it is it's still an amazing deal, you'll find cases that are 60 bucks with only one ore installed fan
What is it?
25 dollars is an amazing deal
There's no better valued case than that one
the 480 is the premier mid-range amd card right now, anything less could start becoming slow to run newer games in the future.
i wouldnt recommend it
the first thing will probably match your choice of parts better, but the second query would show you specific how your case is designed
when you can just search for mid range skylake gaming builds but also search for stuff specific to your case
k
just search "mid-range skylake gaming build" on youtube
i like your parts list but you really need to watch build videos
like 1x16 is more expandable but some motherboards could throttle performance or dislike it if theres only ram in one of the two slots
i think there are some pros and cons to 2x8 vs 1x16 other than price, so you might want to read up on that
is 1x16 cheaper
https://www.amazon.com/Rosewill-Black-Gaming-Computer-CHALLENGER/dp/B003YVJJ5Y
even the graphics card?
wtf TI is literally pokemon go now, they have heroes floating in front of the analyst's desk
ign will probably give it 6/10 not enough man
but it is called no man
thats probably not man enough
hmm
so thats like pig level
so a dog thats slightly more intelligent than normal dogs or slightly intelligent overall
on a scale of no man to man how man is no man's sky
now i can break in and steal them
isnt that a security risk
yeah im at least going to wait for reviews
what if it doesnt live up to the hype
what if that games sucks
although it's something you have to plan months in advance, ticket sales open up in like april and sell out in like 5 minutes
ok
valve has no sponsors besides themselves and the community who buy hats
the community
and almost mechanically identical to the current dota 2
the originally dota mod was  very popular
oh it's older than that
sex her
playing
is that lindsey stirling
i like gabe's flip flops
a lot of people who dont know dota watch this just because its 20 million dollar prize ool
https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti
so everything is three hours later for us
they are on pacific time
oh until late
TI lasts until saturday or sunday i think
maybe not in terms of viewership but in terms of money definitely
its the biggest gaming event of the year
sure why not
oh man the stage turned blue
but for only 8 hours more you're a lot higher level
if you add his time on my account thought thats probably almost 28
so i guess the lucio ball boost and the time spent on my account balance out
yeah but those hours include him playing on my account
i feel like ronald's overwatch level is artificially inflated due to lucioball
:((((((((((((((
is it more or less
actually no play it with me in  two weekends when lucio ball is gone
well then play iit with me this weekend
holy shit the stage looks epic
once a year he shows himself
The GabeN himself will be there
yo keenan you should watch the TI opening ceremony in 3 min https://www.twitch.tv/dota2ti
And real tournaments and stuff
You guys should seriously get rocket league when Lucio ball expires.
It's just a more fleshed out version of Lucio ball with more maps and not everyone looks the same
?
well im not deaf
im trying to fix the sound on my laptop
When i can play
Get your work done now so you can play later
But i have to wake up at 7 am Tomorrow and won't be able to play until like 10
On laptop
I can maybe play too, i downloaded it
i thought you said he moved in yesterday
BY MYSELF
ronald you made me play a dota game by myself
Who did
Who did
K
im not hating i just dont understnd
dont they all look the same
how can there be so many lucios in one game
but whats the point if only lucio can play in lucio ball
that makes sense the heroes all represent different countries
like they do in dota or runescape
oh i see this is like a special event
but why is it more than a week
is there still a normal weekly brawl
so it's more than a weekly brawl
why is it only until august 22 if they put so much work into this mode
overwatch doesnt have any soccer maps
make me understand
isnt it only 3v3
is it like dlc feature
so is it a weekly brawl thats longer than a week
i still dont understant  whats so good about lucioball
Where are your legs?
I call Photoshopped
Fuck you guys are too good at guessing
How did you know I was in DC
I think it might be new
No i was just here in February but I've never seen that sculpture before

Wow George Washington would be offended
Would you guys like to see a sculpture i just found
Or biking
Or hiking
It kind of is if you are on a road trip or a plane and can't really cool stuff
Soylent doesnt require a freezer.
Or even a refrigerator.
How would a smoothie last a week
But someone like you only takes like 1/6 of that serving size for a meal right
Literally for workiuts
2600cal
Is it like 1 serving of that per day
I don't think that's what one serving means
1 serving is a gallon?
A protein shake obviously has more protein, they are like meant for working out
Only in protein
Send me picture of label
Nah
Protein shakes are also around the same price
It's basically true
It's not because protein shakes only have Protein
This is like $2.40 per meal
I don't think so
Just read the reviews on Amazon they are pretty descriptive
I don't think it has that much sweetness, it's probably more like non honey nut Cheerios
The powder is less good tasting I've heard, and it's texture is more like a malt shake
According to amazon reviews bottled taste like the milk left over after eating Cheerios
That's basically me, plus its not like i really enjoy eating anyway
Well it was invented by grad students who didn't have the time nor money to spend on eating and preparing food
I mean that's what their product is
Yeah
Interesting
It's literally the most genius food invention since sliced bread
I've been wanting to try this for months
www.soylent.com
Guess what I ordered today
Keenan i think he needs his bagel.
Im not a chameleon expert but that kind of behavior is indicative of needing a bagel
http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/2548899546 here's the build
Ronald wings played supply morphling today and won
Lost to alliance 0-2 but beat wings 2-0 and are about to beat LGD 2-0and went 1-1 with navi
Also how is TNC beating everyone
Dota has 322k viewers
Yes I just watched ESC lose 0-2 to EG
And even if bad movies still make profit they will eventually build a bad public reputation and the franchise/ trademarks that made the bad movie popular in the first place will diminish in popular
But definitely not s much as they could
If they want more profit shouldn't they care about the quality of the production crew and not fund it until they ensure a good producer
Yes but someone has to decide if it gets funding
Then who decides who produces
How can they hire dumb producers
I don't understand why it's so hard to make a good movie
And fix it
DC should learn eventually that their movies need to stop sucking
This new Android split screen feature is really useful for watching TI and chatting you at the same time
What if it's good
Break
Can't you just bream that promise
Who did you promise
It seemed like you did in the car in the way to North Carolina
Why you pissed
I might be seeing it Saturday night
Lol
Is that what he goes by now
Phil?
Yeah in so glad it wasn't Mei i would have nightmares if Mei were constantly in my apartment
Roger flew to new York in may for her prom
Found her
https://m.facebook.com/mayaluvsmusic
And iu is one of the best piano schooks
No she is a piano major i think and went to piano academy at Jacobs last summer that's how they met
I wonder how much she'll be living with us..
she's a freshman so she's required to have her own housing but I'm kind of curious how much she'll want to stay with Roger
Lol
Yup
Keenan you can visit us and stay in my room over night so it's not weird when Roger has someone over and not me
Her Facebook name is something like itsa me mario
I see her in his profile pic but im too bad at Facebook to do d her
What's her name
Hold on i can check Facebook real quick
Yeah
Mei or Maya or something
I think it starts with M
I'm pretty sure she is but I've never met her
Why
Cascading style sheets
In*
He has a girlfriend in new York who is coming to IU as a freshman next semester so I'm sure she'll be with us some nights I'm his room
With Roger
I decided I'm done working today because I'm actually done working
I'm staying at campus view
I'm not sure if we'll be in Chicago or just near it
Because we need to get another person and do laundry
And Chicago
The week before classes i might go to Tennessee/Alabama/st Louis
2 weeks maybe 3
It's actually Cincinnati but same thing
I should probably be able to play games Saturday night if I'm not too tired since I'll be at home for one night
No but I'll be traveling on the weekend
Ok will do
No sorry Keenan i didn't have time last night to get to your porn recommendation
I could just as easily took a picture of it there
From our lab at iu
It's all equipment we brought
If you look closely you can see classified information
Yeah and 50,000 dollar eyetracker

Definitive proof

Good thing I'm not on Noblis wifi
When i ordered stuff from microcenter i got it literally the next day because the store is in Cincinnati
Yeah microcenter ships stuff and if the store is close is really fast
They are just a research nonprofit organization that contracts a lot with FBI and other government agencies
I'm at Noblis now
Or get parts i mean
When do you think you'll order parts
Better turn on shadows boys

I almost opened it at work and then i realized i don't have my phone at work
K bye guys snow I'm sleeping
Tomorrow night i have my own room though
and Tom Busey is my roommate
Because IM SLEEPING
Yes
You won't hear from me again after that
My bed time is 10:00
I hope they read it
This conversation is a NSA gold mine
That was pretty sneaky
Today i walked to the break room without an escort
If people aren't paying attention maybe i can get passed secure places
I also have a shirt that looks like i could be a legit FBI dude
I have contacts
Ok
If you zoom in maybe you can even see the targets
Here's what a sniper range looks like

But the roads in Texas dont have road signs saying "caution explosive containing vehicles on roadway ahead"
I also saw a truck that was driving right in front of us full of explosives
I can just imagine them watching the news and then being like shit we should get back to work on that
Inside the building they were watching CNN which was talking about the FBIs investigation of Clintons emails
I'm literally sleeping
and of course once you know what the inside looks like you can break in
idk because then you see what the inside of the fbi academy looks like
i took this picture before they told me it was illegal so really it's not illegal
i bet you never did
i touched a piece of 9/11
yes thats the real life pentagon they dont llike you taking pictures of it because then people know it's actually tiny as fuck

i cant sneak phone past security
no
would you guys like to see an illegal picture
how does this only have 1 point when i upvoted it
keenan you will be downvoted
did you really havev to title it after gonewild
ok i'll have time to play when i get back
is it only for a week
damn
is it the weekly brawl
idk what lucioball is
ronald you took fucking ap bio and we did a field trip for this stuff
ronald i don t know how you've never seen a crayfish before
lol when you sent that post i assumed it was a crayfish
Well really I'm held captive because i need to be escorted everywhere and I cant bring anything with wireless like a phone inside
Here's the FBI laboratory that i work in

I need to sleep
The link still isn't updated for me but it might be because I'm on mobile
So i sound like.im literally better than right in front of you?
That's some serious immersion
You can't judge because you haven't experienced better
Yeah shitty ones
I also doubt pc part picker is able to properly detect parts
That doesn't mean it's good
Good
Did you make sure the power supply is goof
You need to send a new link for the build if you changed it because the old link is still the same stuff
You have to read benchmarks for games
How could you have the Rx 480 be in your work computer if it just came out
Everyone knows that mccree is just a worse version if battle mercy
Lol
Also make sure you research that power supply and case a lot.
You cmhave to make sure your power supply is good quality or if it breaks you could ruin other parts
No you just read the specs sheet and check for antenna ports in the back
I almost never use wifi anyway but the motherboard comes with built in wifi and Bluetooth
My desktop using a mini ITX which is even smaller and only has one port for the graphics card and that's it
Micro ATX is usually cheaper and if you aren't going to use the extra size for anything there's no reason to
The second slot is farther down
You can definitely fit one adapter in the motherboard even with the card installed
The motherboard is micro ATX instead of normal size so there are less slots than usual and you just have to be careful
No it will
It does but even though that motherboard has two slots for adapters one of them may be covered up by a wide gaming card
Also that graphics card is about 250 and the price isn't included in that list because you have to manually enter it
You want it either built in the motherboard or connected right to it
You have to look at that stuff, idk.
But if possible i would try not to have to get an external USB wifi adapter
Although depending on the width of your video card there might only be room for one internal adapter
i mean that particular motherboard doesnt have them built in so you'll need internal or external adapaters if you want that stuff
You'll need adapters or a different motherboard if you want wifi and or blutooth
it looks like an entire movie full of memes
lol it has so many dislikes
