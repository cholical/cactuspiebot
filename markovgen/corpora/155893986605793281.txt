I just wanted to make sure he at least knew it was in bad taste
that's why i dismissed it
to relate a fictional event to real events?

just seems in poor taste when he's actually victimizing real people
but i guess discord is a safe space
just seems inappropriate

Considering though he‚Äôs s major star and make sexual assaults are never taken as seriously this will certainly be buried when the opposing headline for the last three weeks have been ‚Äúold Jewish man rapes all your favorite celebrities‚Äù
I for some reason though that shit with him and that kid had been around forever.
Shit what happened.

Out of everyone.
But also I think it‚Äôs funny Lina and I were the ones.
Out of everyone.
Not so humble brag.
<@!125452744440938497> so Lina and I are the only people who got a perfect score on our literary theory papers.
The average was a c- so our Ai is trying to convince the professor to curve it.
Too spooky
<@!125452744440938497> I didn‚Äôt get any sleep last night
i hate this game
The gang's all here
this chocolate scene has got me hard
Fuck

wait asher
its fucking hilarious
like this
asher are you just trying to trick me into playing an entire dating sim
or just reflective in general i mean
it is hilarious
i love how self reflective he is
the protagonist is the best mediator alive
holy shit
shots fucking fired
just women fighting about whether i liked their poem more than the other
i wish this was what my english classes were like
fucking curve ball
whoa
üòÆ
true genius

it is the most ineffecient fucking way to read
tbh though, get this bitch outta my way
this is some dangerous escapism
<@!125452744440938497> asher i fell like you and i must have picked the same anime girlfrend
I'm too scared
I don't know if i want this
asher....
I already accidently spoiled it for myself by looking at the steam tags
dammit asher

literally none of them are funny
except here is the kicker
"TELL ME IM FUNNY LIEK YOU"
all of these are just "BROTHERS VALIDATE ME"
especially the ben and jerys oner
they made me v uncomfortable
yeah dawg
basically what im saying is i want you to impulse buy a 600 dollar kimono

https://nextshark.com/t-kimono-for-men/

idk if you thought this
asher

Joi and Joe

You and I could just play in the car
Can we actually pick you up at about 8?
Hmmm
<@!71716577669550080> have you determined how you‚Äôre getting to the movie?
So I can vote for them.
I need to know who this is
Probably some intern bored at work and saw a comma was missing
I was about to say that
...
Okie dokie
One level at a time
If you are gonna be with Clara you can just get a ride with her
No big deal
Nah I was just going to say we could get a level of cuphead in

^ same
And then i also remember that he just still lives in bloomington and is going to ivy tech
but then i remember that I pray to him every night, so he is very much still a part of me.
sometimes, I feel like ronald isn't a part of our lives
yeah
üîë  --> ‚úâ  ---> <:preciousboy:234377704261156865>

And you‚Äôd never know
Because I could be playing hat in time at the exact same tome
Guys it‚Äôs sad
Yeah idk

Is 22 on eshop
I didn‚Äôt know there is a physical version of 88 heroes mac
Oh fuck

Rare celebrity sex tape.
in 4 its actually about encouraging normal people to embrace the sides of themselves they aren't proud of to better themselves
i like the persona plot to 4 a lot more than 5 because in 5 its about changing the hearts of perverted adults
asher are you ever going to play persona 5
so üñï
well i just beat it
in persona a lvl 100 caterpie would be like a lvl 5 gyrados
also you cant really grind in persona because its not like pokemon where a lvl 100 caterpie can whin
doesnt effect 1hit ko moves
10% dating teens
because this games is just 90% rng
i would love to see a speedrun
wipes my whole team
10% chance to hit
and it uses an instakill move
only for the boss to be at 5hp
an hour long boss fight
bullshit
actially
persona 4....is
probably the best song ever
lmao
YES
2049 is definitely more entertaining
i like both a lot
yeah idk
the final cut?
lol
persona 4 is so fucking hard
üò¶
maybe wednesday or thrusday
i cant tomorrow
yes
yes
and i plan on spending the whole time playing mario
the 27th is my last day of work
lol
I just doubt ill play it that night
so im 100% going now
i mean i just cancelled my order
ik but that would mean id get homea round 12:30
ill cancel mine rn then
okay
lol
yes?
oh i meant the midnight release
i mean i have class the next day
lol
i just wouldnt really play it
what do you think

i got us pizza
okie dokie
asher when are you off work?
Perfect
I saw that yoko taro one it was oerfeft
And we've seen he understands dope ass desert aesthetics
Yeah but they are finally very similar
I never saw arrival
I thought it was amazing when I saw it
Have you ever seen enemy?
Hmm
^^^
0% fresh
Like an actual anime hologram instead of a beautifully realistic Cuban woman?
If joi was like an actual hatsune miku type
Could you imagine how different the movie would be
You but actually though asher
It was both creepy and arousing.
Very ethereal
Because she has one of those faces that you genuinely fall in love with
That Cuban woman who played joi was also perfect casting
His ear made me want to die though.
Yes
Cells interlinked
Interconnected
Interconnected
Lmao
You know like 12 movies
Mac
Lol
And yeah if Macs never heard of a movie it can't be a classic
To old one
Sequel
Honestly though.
There was some twin peaks level dead air in that movie
Runner
Blade
Same
Best movie this year though.
That was the exact point where I had to make sure I wasn't having a stroke
"Cells"
"Do you ever feel confined?
Cells"
Yeah
Asher we should learn the post trauma briefing together.
ü§ñüêù
Here's the real question though: were the bees replicants the whole time?!?
I don't really see how they could have gotten that from the film.
üò≥
You mean the whole time?!?
üëçüèæ
Y'all should I buy a segacd?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4tLbzm3oAM
Still dorky but I'll only wear them while I play video games
These look way less dorky than I was expecting

mac you should get this
https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/11/16455534/ps3-emulator-rpcs3-4k-support
because it could be worth it to wait until we get really good seats, but idk the next time theyll be in chicago
the question asher is if it is worth it if we have like balcony seats or something
they  don't do photos anymore at shows
my thought was we'd leave around 12-1 and then get back around 12-1am
or would you skip it?
when is your class?
fuck yeah
in chicago
its a thursday
I want to buy a everyone mbmbam tickets for christmas and drive us all up to go see a live show
(i.e) how possible is it for you to get off work and class
<@!125452744440938497> ARE YOU FREE NOVEMBER 16th?
this
This game literally had a Mario bartender.

^
That you are 6'4" and 11"
Classic 16 bit

Guys
üò¶
you arent
no
yeah

The clothing store
<@!125452744440938497> express is 40% off this weekend
Still my favorite game ever
So if you get knocked in the air you're fucked
Because that's the only time you can't dodge
The ai is programmed to immediately air punish you
This game is ridiculous
So sometimes you will just get fucked over because two enemies will just do their 6x combo on you in sequence until you're dead
But you can only dodge 4 times
The ai randomly chooses between 1-6 streak combos
Honestly I don't know why people don't talk about this more the enemy animations are some of the hardest I've ever seen
It's not even the combos
I thought it was going to be a sexy easy baby game
did yall know bayonetta is a hard game?
dumb
because i can'y see my game collection from my bed
ü§∑üèæ its more so I can look at it when im jerking off
?
https://vgcollect.com/KeenanAM
just so i can brag
also
it looks pretty cool and apparently it is getting one of those notorious full overhaul updates that all the cool devs are doing these days
<@!125452744440938497> have you played strafe?
i feel like im having a fever dream looking at that
plot to gen 7: a powerful scientist has stolen the cosmic light of the universe and you must travel to another dimension to return order to the cosmos.
plot to gen 1: some thugs are stealing pokemon, and you've got to beat their boss so they will knock it off
im sure the commmunity was pissed
lol have you guys heard of this furry episode of hannibal
hands
you know what's sucks to draw
lo
yeah im waiting
becasue im pretty sure my puyo puyo skills would be mad rad right now
we need to play it together
in know
because i realized that puyo is just literally doctor mario
also i need to play puyo and tetris
exceot the japanese version doesnt even take place in the mario universe
lol
but im pretty sure the japanese version is very diffrent
ive played the us version
ah gotcha
also isn't tetris attacks on the japanese one?
like punch out would be fun in japanese
without really having to rebuy them all
or at least just happy to have acess to them
im more excited to play the japanese version of a lot of the games
nah
which is what imi most excited about
yeah and mystical ninja
and keep the us ones shut
play it
because i didn't know what i was selecting
im a woman in my japanese account
luckily i have a japanese and american amazon account
I always just have to guess
that would have helped
shit there's an english mode?
just got it
fuck
its down in price now!
with no real metric other than he thinks they look like bad games
but it just taking random games every day and marking them half off
because he left me a passive aggresive note when i refunded someone 6 dollars
i feel like ron just can't do cost benefit analysis
lol nope
so spencer was like then just change the return restrictions
it is because we are too lenient with returns
nope
at first i was worried that it was because he found out i was abusing my admin privledges
lol at this point it's funny
we do
We've had a switch longer than any retailer because we are charging 420 for it
have i also told you about our switch that ron cursed?
which means we need to have ron personally to do anything that isn't just a simple transaction
but also spencer's
mine
like not just mind
apparently ron took away pretty much all of our admin privledges
RIP eastside gameworld
lol spencer is quitting
rip entirity of super star saga
remake 1/10
geno gone üò¶
literally every episode is just what will be growing from the body this time
Golden lets do it
Hmm, bees?
did it
Shit, k lets make it flowers then
We already did that Todd
Lets have it so they find a body where mushrooms are growing from the body
writers room: guys what should we do this time
literally ever murder in hannibal is the exact same
^
literally perfect
the love seats they have there are still good seats
for the experience
yeah
cool
can ylu get tickets
ever
movie
pokemon
best
perfection
its literally a distilled version of the best pokemon story done with 2017 animation
yeah but we know the story
its the best pokemon movie ever made
oh yeah no doubt
even out of context
because the sparrow scene makes me cry everytime
i hate that im going to cry in the first 20 mintues of the movie
üòñ
üò¶
because hopefully it isnt
are you sure the showing is in english
its very nice
ive been to the theater it's at too
yeah sure we can go see it
is that the trailer to the best pokemon movie ever made?
oh im sorry
k
alright
yeah
k
is there a mario demo there
rn?
and how both of them havent improved that much
i love how long theyve been doing this
i hate how much im in love with simone
blue wario (that one is a classic)
picaso painting
worm
spider
dratini
all my favorite mario characters
http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m931tjgmlY1rrftcdo1_r1_1280.png
like im pretty sure everyone working on that game was smoking crack through the whole dev period
and is named rudy
and has a castle
who just shows up out of nowhere
he apparently a clown
with no introduction
who you fight
this is thte voice of the final boss
also
yeah its so out of place
to a puzzle game
this is a fucking 30 minute long story mode
but its still an rpg
also color spash is a paper mario game
16 years before it
yeah
this randomly starts playing and its so out of tone with the rest of the game
but litsten to this
i cant find a shorter version
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyDxZCAOQV0
speaking of music
for every step backwards they take they take two steps towards nipples
this is the company that literally a few weeks ago released marios nipples on the internet
you are so quiick to forget
mac
uhhuh
üò¶
nintendo would have probably appreciated that press more
you could have written "Nintendo has set up a special Miiverse channel to celebrate the over decade long service"
its so dreary
just saying mourn it's imminent end
"The Wii Memorial Channel"
i wish that was nintendo's offical press release
i love that phrasing
cool
guys have you ever sneezed so hard you vomitted?
i technically have this thing called "I don't feel like putting on pants tonight"
rn
we goin' to best buy?
I am literally the applebees #1 target demo
I watch pro wrestling
I'm more bees culture than you could ever bee
Ronald don't even fucking try
Trump was president.
And amc was offering 5 dollar movie tickets
Applebees was offer $1 margaritas
And made songs about Pokemon being sex slaves
And just released every game
Where Nintendo just literally lost their minds.
Kids let me tell you about the year 2017
We need to start that podcast
does friday work for you?
lmao i will
lol okay
nier
i still owe you money
speaking of which
if i had a think to play vinyl id get hte automata one
im suprised you didn't get both
link?
lmao
without any context
and play it
or you could own it
hmm
you could get the free trial
<@&227443709560619010> make sure you get mgsv on your ps4
Let's make quadcopters over winter break
Mac
Your favorite.
I'm having bagels
Come eat lunch with me
Mac
Lol
So let me know now or you'll have to wait
Actually nvm zzyzx is off in ten minutes
<@!71716577669550080> if you want it you have to let me know before 6:45

Lol this bad game doesn't deserve such a cool cover
Because you can only use that with smash
But I can't decide if that is good or not
It reminded me that I need a GameCube Wii U thing
We have a nice game cube controller come in
Or just you know...use the controller it came woth
But you could always just use the joystick if you are looking for precision anyway
They are slightly less precise if you are used to small controllers
Unless you are doing some speed run platforming I don't think it'll really matter
I mean I know the normal classics
But you can actually hold the pro ones
The classic pro are more rounded
The original is more like the wiiu d pd
I'd have to agree
And power a is the only good third party brand
It's so pretty though.
The power a one is 20
12.99
Just the classic pro
Yeah we don't have any actual classics in stock
Oh the first one yeah
Flase
Also this power a one
Looks almost brand new

Mac we have a really nice black one in stock
Whys that a problem.
?
k
lol
i have to eat dinner than we can play dotes after?
lol
Already got
They aren't even hiding that they are in bed together anymore
Yeah it's a good game
Because most of the games you could get for way cheaper than the combined but for minecraft and gta that is solid
But for your brother it is technically a good price point
Normally no
Is it for your brother?
We definitely want to come for new years
Hmm
This is what we are doing right now
When
Play with me
i knew all i needed on my 3ds was animal crossing until the next pokemon game came out
lol
the rest were garbage 3ds games
i mean tbf the only games that i sold that were worth anything were ocarina and bravely default
Mac golf story is exactly your humor
because i thought they had given up on it
before x came out
i probably had somewhere around 30 games before i sold most of them
but true
oh you mean by playing game world games?
I wasn't counting that
cheat?
I was just dumb and sold my first 3ds collection
ive definitely played more 3ds games though
3ds is my smallest collection other than psp and vita
i only have 10
you have more 3ds games than me
lol why
in two weeks i will have  more wii u games than 3ds
no
IM GOING FOR IT
http://www.ebay.com/itm/202061791098?&clk_rvr_id=1322164845269&mfe=si_en-US_recentAlertClick&mpt=1506632186896
but that'd be mean
because we don't test games
I could sell the broken luigi to gameworld
but the wii u ones have the sratch resistant layer like playstation
if it was a normal disc i could fix it
and mario tennis
monster hunter
pokken
starfox
mario maker
smash
4 amiibos
2 nunchycks
2 motion plus remotes
ill have only spent 200 for a wii u
but if i sell this bundle for the price im asking for
but both the luigi u disc is just fucked up
yeah idk
because they are crazy
disc side down
they just leave them on counters
ever
people don't put the game back in their cases
^
so you know they are actually insane
the sent me a message in all caps
the game is just too scratched to wokr
its beyond repair
no
yup
because ebay will give me my money back and ban him from sales for 30 days
actually its a pretty legit concern
Now I get to do this
https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/2076766542546404
to keep me from calling ebay
dude just gave me 50 bucks
this is great
lol this guy is losing his mind
lol
but it is still shitty
so I'm not going to return the whole fucking thing just for luigi
the other one is negligable price point wise
super luigi u
because honestly only 1 game doesn't work
but now i have a problem
I think they are just pissed I got it for less than they were wanting to sell it at
which is crazy
but he says I have to send everything
so my arguement is that if they work I'll just send them to him and he can give me a refund
which he claims work
even though I just want a small percentage refund of the games
this guy is arguing it's all or nothing
I'm trying to think how i want to play this
two games didn't work
no the wii u that came in
it's great
I'm having an arguement with a guy on ebay
if we got our tickets at 7 we could honestly just go chill at my house until 10
because then we don't have to wait in line
that just determines when we should be there to get our tickets
that doesnt indicate at all the actual bloomington demand
yeah i mean the thing is
just so we can be super safe
ill pick you up at 6 then
okay
weird
does target have any info?
Now excuse me while I go buy golf story with my share of the profits
Surprise: wasn't charming.
The guy I sold it to
Oh and guess what
<@!71716577669550080> look at your free fucking money

I can work past all star.
Literally not a sjw and feminist is the only thing I have problem with.
Reading this bio was a roller coaster

Go to bed
It's got like a day left
But I'm watching it
So it'll probably go up
It's on eBay
I'm at Kroger rn
There's a tb one I found for 300 white
Lol k
I could sell my ps4 to gw for 200
I may get it then
K
I'll run it through the Keenan test.
https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/1726318741004760
The controller is just a bonus
250 is already a good price on a slim of it's working.
Matter what you can sell them for
Doesn't matter what they are worth
50
For
I can sell them
So
I sell them every day
Is
100% os
That's basically a 200 dollar ps4
How does that not sound like a good deal?
You can sell it to me
Ik that's a good thing
You think I should bother trying
Used
With an extra controller
Mac there's a ps4 slim for sale in town for 250
fucking stupid
how many fucking golf games are they going to make this year
did you hear about this new golf game?
hey mac
ü§° üôà
and yes asher we would love to share
so im sure you could handle like 6
megan and i were going to just take a nibble off of one
you can have a couple
yeah mac
megan has lsd gummies
megan and i will drop acid
i think we would have to be there earler
if there was a midnight release i would change my opinion
50-90% of the community who wants a snesc in bloomington wants one casually
because all the swtich people spent their money on switch
but smaller
itll just be the demo of the switch launch
or even follow launch shit
you really overestimate the number of people who buy launch shit
but
agree
i will be shocked if there is 10% of the people that were in line for the switch
dude ive been gauging the hype for the snes classic versus the switch and nes classic
*even though there wont*
im going to feel like such an ass if there are 200 people in front of bestbuy and target
lol
and probably a jap snes
no hangover
at the end of this i will have 2 snes classics
wrong
or camp
and scout it out
mac why don't you go bike to target at 5
asher do you actually want to smoke?
"all 8 people"
"everyone"
we wont
yeah
waking up at 6 to go wait in line for something at 10
lol "confident"
especially since there wont be much of a line
1 person should be fine
eh
i dont think asher gives a fuck
lol
i'll at least promise you that
but i wont be any later
if i do then great
but don't expect me to get there any earlier than 6:30
ill message you when im heading out
id be more comfortable with not waking up at 6:00 on a friday
cool
ill pick you up around 6:30
thats the plan
I am becoming more and more confident from talking to people in the store that there are going to be 5 people in front of target if we go at 6:30
Lol
https://twitter.com/jrobertlennon/status/912874916357210113
I llove the new character limit
HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS
THERE IS A GAMECUBE WARIOWARE GAME
MAC
he's clearly very charming
lmao
aren't you proud
https://www.facebook.com/austin.forrest.39
<@!71716577669550080> this is who is getting your xbox
Also I have three copies so you can just have one
You need ps4 plus
Not yet.
I'm kinda done with dota, every since they announced that free to play one for the switch
Did you see dunkeys metroid review

Lol
That makes sense
Oh whoa
That's fucked up
Should I open it?
I only spent 20 on it
I wasn't expecting that
And it's brand new
Also my copy of Tokyo mireage came in
Whoa fuck
Yeah back when bowsers name was only in the game manual
Yeah
Back when Nintendo was really paying attention to their localizing process in the 80s
So bowser just comes from no where.
Some random Nintendo of America employee probably just names it after themselves.
King koopa
He's only called that in the English.
There's no source info as to why he's called that
I know but it made me think.
I was trying to figure out why bowser is called bowser
Lol
I wish the article was was the headline implied
https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/dc-mayor-despite-legal-pot-city-will-not-become-like-amsterdam/2015/02/24/c34a4d3a-bb9b-11e4-b274-e5209a3bc9a9_story.html?utm_term=.b397bf55881b
He's the poor mans griffin
Lmao
one of the slimesan boss fights is just literally the final boss from metroid
lol mac
literally skyrim
fuck
you know know words like "sword" "orc" and "necromancer"
keenan your grammar is great but you're vocabulary is pretty limited
I think ill write a dnd campaign in french to "study"
doing that made me want to write a dnd campaing
from just playing through
ive already gottten 4
so i can go super saiyan
regardless ill try to get it today or tomorrow
hmm maybe
since it wasnt changed on the most recent ps4 and pc patch
i doubt they will actually
when i just want to unlock the final level
but i'm not about to waste my time exploring around random stages
yeah but i don't think you are supposed to know that
the emeralds aren't location dependant
because you just do the geen hill valley one over again
turns out getting all the emeralds is way easier than i thought
$1 says ronald will never respond to that
just think of your assignment as literally skyrim
lol
if you do such they make you go find a new thrall for them
and you can either kill the vampires or negotiate a deal with them
in the cave you find a vampiric cult that has taken her
and he directs you to the cave over on the south east side of the lake
so you kill the wolves
you ask him if he's seen the girl and he says he's looking for someone to kill all these wolves around his cabin
the swordsmith's daughter is missing so you have to find her in the lake, but all you find is a cabin with an old man
(okay still easy enough)
but first you need the sword, the shield and the fire tonic
You've got to Kill the dragon (k easy)
sounds like an rpg
really drives it home
and having one word on the final page really summarzes your overall point
having a letter on each page diminishes the aniticaption
page 6: END
page 5: E
page 4:
page 3: H
page 2:
page 1: T
i got you
or fully finish sonic so i can focus all that time later on slimesan
time wise
so i could either swap sonic and slime san
i play like an hour of slime-san right now a week so its like a minor quest
myac
should my next sidequest be getting all the chaos emeralds or beating slime-san
mac
"oh shit hey what's up?"
"later"
lol
and ill probably do something after that too
ill wake up early for an snes and im working from 5 to midnight for lotus
im gonna have such a busy night friday
what if there is a really cool boss
but mac
üò¶
I'll let you know how good it os
Lol
I gotta make sure all my homework is finished today so I can play golf story all day Thursday.
Maybe it's not going anywheree
Gg best puzzle game ever
When dr mario comes out for switch
Honestly though
Lol they should have an auto accelerate and auto steer mode in chess
But we can play cjess
No you can't play
Yes I was just playing mario kart
Excuse me sir?
With who?
Lol
The most casual quick game ever
And ask someone if they want to play chess
And pull out my switch
Mac I should be waiting for a class
Uhhuh
...
And chess.com exists
I have like boards
Lol
Why?
Fuck
lol
üòà
im surprised this got through the safe filter

<@!71716577669550080>
thats good to hear
omg the switch home button for mania was such a problem
cool
I think we will easily get one from target
i really doubt its going to be that bad
but like i said
but if the lines too long im out
no ill get up early
that's what you can play then
oh shit
for nothing
beucase theres no way imi waking up that early
i need to be guaranteed one
actually no
well we can only wait and see
cool
I'm just 85% confident we can get one at target
but im all for hanging out
what im saying is that i guarantee we would still get one if we got there at 9 or 9:30
lol
but itll be nice weather and im chill with just haning out anyway
yeah, i think we will be fine
and this is divided between target, best buy, and walmart
thats no different than the switch
itll just be gamers and collectors
non gamers aren't going to wait in line for it
because it will be divided between three major stores, and there is probably less overall demand
theres no way the line for the snes classic will be longer than the switch though
if I pick you up around 6:30 we can swing by target and then go straight to bestbuy if it is busy
I fucking love the chain of quests in rpgs
but i'd definitly prefer 8 as opposed to 10 if at all possible
that way no harm done if the target line is too long
the mall doesnt open until 10
actually just one entrance
if it's not that long we can just wait there
before we get in line at best buy
but we can check both real quick
oh yeah
the other is in the mall
just one
if it opens at 8 we can just check
not really
we could just drive by target at six to see how long the line is
why arent we waiting in line at target?
i have class at 11:15
mac what are we going to play
this game is so 2015
just had sex in witcher
we should definitely call wednesday just to make sure
and me
blu-ray player
Lol
Also it looks like you are photoshopped into that photo
Teens

Look at these beautiful teens.

Fuck
It was kept in a smokers house.
But not long enough for any damage





Also vc games are just like free money for nitnendo
And if they didn't by now that would be incentive to guy the sn classic because they weren't going to buy them on virtual console any way
If they advertise you get 3ds games with the sn that will make Nintendo look so good but they wouldn't lose any money because everyone owns most of the games
Because they can do deals to look really good but know that most of their fanbase already has the games
I mean that's not really a problem that works in their favor
That would be a major step in the right direction.
I think if if you own the nes or SN classic you should get those games on 3ds
That is super rare and is garbage.
Which only had 1 backwards compatible model.
For everything except sony
Before with just physical games they won
I just think the market moving towards online stores has stunted it
And compatibility
Mario kart ds local play
I mean Nintendo used to have the best user experience
The online program once it starts I think will be a big step
At user experience.
I feel like Nintendo is definitely getting better thiugh
Yeah but if I own every Nintendo system I should have to buy super Mario world 3 times
But it's honestly probably the worst of the big three
You'd like Nintendo would have the best vc
God I hope so
Like earthbound.
It's crazy to me that if you buy a Sony game that exists in multiple platforms you have it on all platforms, but Nintendo doesn't do that with 3ds titles
Now I can also finally get all the smash dlc.
üòÑ
Because I don't want to play on the pad.
I really don't want to but a pro controller by I really need one for bayonetta
It's the Wii with the amiibos
Oh shit dog
I with the pro controller was backwards compatible
My Wii U just same in.
With bayonetta
I thought I was gonna hang with phil tonight but he's busy.
Probably like 5-7
When you free to play with me
Lmao
I texted you to tell you about the video in my dream but you never responded so I was scared I was dreaming it.
It was honestly the scariest dream I've ever had.
He was sitting in this maroon chair in a dark Victorian den and was just explaining how Judy manipulated him.
<@!125452744440938497>  I just woke up from a dream where a video of leland palmer explaining the ending of twin peaks was uploaded onto youtube
Ew
^
i feel dumb
i just made ff7 1000000x easier for me
......
but yeah if a game about being a detective that comes out 15 years after ace attorney doesnt have way better mechanics it would be a shit game
but ive never really considered anything in aa to be puzzle-like
yeah
considering grimiore is less linear
two very different games though
yeah
those two brothers will die
but like imagine what will happen once snipperclips becomes a trophy
i think kojima just wanted snake in smash because he really liked the game
lol
i don't think he is like a nintendo fanboy like the people at ubisoft are
well kojima is pretty established
can you imagine what it's like for the people who made bayonetta to have her in smash
to one day be labeled an honorary nintendo game
Thats my dream
I feel ripped off
the nintendo music livestream is playing okami
wtf
Lol
Oh geralt you scoundrel
Best line so far
I also have no idea how to use 90% of the games features.
There are really cool parts but nothing has been like "whoa"
The monster designs are 99% of why I'm still playing it
That was honestly pretty cool
It's just really over saturated.
It very clearly designed specific fun for you
It's also not one of those games where you have to make your own fun
But like I'm entertained
And nothing memorable happens
In just how I can play for hours and not remember anything.
It reminds me of kingdom hearts
It is really good.
But it's also really boring.
I don't know if I'll ever know
Still don't know if i like it
So many hours into witcher
Not even reggie
Lol
Nintendo did say they didn't want a repeat of the nes classic
Saw that

Shit sexiest thing yet
Half of these character models are just the same person
This woman is tripping so hard
Shit

We truly live in the greatest era for gaming
I didn't want to lose 16 hours of final fantasy 7
Dude but actually though.
That is some buckwild compatibility.
Dude I took my ps1 memory card and now have my save file on my vita
I have ascended

he's getting his ps4 on friday
is it for your grandma?
lmao
that's ableist asher
...
guy
How long are you there
are you in chicago or something?
give an example of absurdity

<@!127535721857679362> look what im putting in my power point presentation for tomorrow
this is perfect for gertie
we'd die
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T3kF2n75AY
we need to get high sometime and watch old cartoons prepared in adavnce by me and music prepared by you
lol
"now i will do a dance"
yeh
and couldn't handle the music
but i had to take notes on that video
or the main theme of the shining
but idk
my initial thought was empty bliss beyond this world
it needs a lot of work
good
i love the wiimote
a lot of people tried to beat him up during this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_YFq9X2QM4
there is so much footage of people trying to beat the shit out of him and him getting arrested he doesn't use
i mean that's what eric andre does
^
people will go along with anything if they are being filmed
"ima tuck u in at night"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMW-SzZKJ-Q
That or he just really like naruto
perfect design
perfect character
too perfect
Fuck
lol with zzyzx leaving our senior employee will have been working here for 3 weeks
blame the nip
^
why
yeah
which would be hilarious
Spencer said if we can get ron to fire me i can get unemployement for 6 months
I haven't been unemployed since senior year
im so excited to not work
god
lol
like that majora's mask wont work with a ram expansion
our job is super easy but you have to know technical shit
that's going to be every employee
.....gamecube?
"excuse me sir, where are your gamecube games?"
That's an actual crazy business strategy
he wants to start cycling through people more, because it keeps enthusiasm fresh
which is fucking buckwild to me
Apparently ron is wanting to get rid of "legacy employees"
and spencer is only staying because he is manager
Zzyzx and i are both leaving
üò¶
us teens with our shitty bosses
oh no
Mac said "listen keenan you've given everything you've got to this company, now it's time to give something to keenan"
which is funny because it was exactly when ron started being shitty
mac convinced me to quit a few days ago
but i don't really need cash right now
and i just got hired to do something for one of phil's professor
sort of i have a graphic design job at IU now
when the dude who spends 4k a year at the store leaves
its going to be really funny though
he's just going to come into gameworld one day and I wont be there
I love it
so passive aggresive
and he keeps texting me asking if i've been doing certain things
and Spencer was like "oh shit keenan?
no he's the only one of us that does anything"
ron asked Spencer if there was anything slacking in my performance at the store
except its a practical joke where ron just looks like an asshole and we don't correct him
and spencer and i don't want to tell him
Ron is basically having spencer find reasons to let me go, but he doesn't know i already quit
lol things have gotten buckwild at game world
when does it come out
?
but "haunted ragtimecore" isn't a genre yet
i gotta find music that syncs better though
it's my new favorite thing to do while relaxing
just for the next time you get high

this game could even take place before most mario games
which i am willing to believe
unless we are to belive this takes place before he got his tattoo
because now that we've seen him shirtless it can be confirmed he doesn't have his tattoo
<@!71716577669550080> do you know how i know super mario odyssey isn't canonical?
K best game ever
tbh this is revolutionary for rpgs at the time....
Mmm such engaging gameplay
that would be such shit if i didn't
lol of course
I NEED TO GET IT

Am I "Facebook user"?
Lol
True diversity now.
ill come
Lol oh shit
Lovely.
Asher I made the new guy feel so uncomfortable.
Because he made a joke about Senran kagura because someone brought one of the games into the store and I just told him I owned it without giving him any context.
And one NASCAR game
There's just so much information.
He bought two wrestling games for the n64
The head and the body aren't even in the right grey palette.
The photoshop job is so terrible.
?
This guy

It's all so hard
I can decide if I'm going to marry asher, ronald, or sweet baby mac yet
Also player to player marriage.
Oh:-(
2017 for the Ninten-boys!
Really great for all those 180 no scopes you have to do
Not really
You need to be able to aim
Aim
^
Not an fps port
So nothing else matters in the port expect aiming
Pubg is a shitty game
Let's make something clear
K hold up
Especially from a port
Microsoft studios doesn't know how to make console fps
Yeah like I said garbage
And all those Microsoft studio shooters are amazing
Yeah
And they have no experience porting console games especially shooters
The port though is going to be shit because bluehole isn't outsourcing it
I think this will at least be stupid fun.
At least as much stupid fun as any other clone, like loadout or league of legends.
That's going to be garbage
As opposed to the more realistic hp of pubg
Also it has the fortnight mechanics which is v different from pubg in that characters are way more tanky
I think that's why they eased up on the royale mechanics it seems.
Making it less intense
Because paragon was sort of garbage, but epic does know how to make really good console shooters
I wonder if it'll be better or not.
It's only 30
I also want to get the wolfenstein bundle
Asher you did this.
You tempted me.
Because I want boxes for all my cartridge games so bad
So they are hard to find
Yeah the problem with cardboard is that is decomposes.
I remember the half life one being dope though.
Yeah I think it came out a little after companies eased up on boxes
Nice.
I've never seen that version of it
I thought the orange box one was just abnormal cd case
Lol
N64 boxes are still the best imo
So much packaging for so little.
lol I have a shit ton At my parents
üò¶
I can't hear you

What's that mac?

Can we just acknowledge that to tonality of my ps4 games are all over the fucking place?
I'm glad you got your closure
lol
I made it to philip back when it came out and he didn't get it
lol I'm so glad you made that ron Howard joke
Lol
I'm ready.

For the two minutes?
Correct I told them all I had dota

i wont have a pc by the time cuphead comes out
because i want it
sell it to me
mac seriously though
............
.......
.....
....
Found then
Nvm
I should have like 3 or 4
That is crazy
How to fuck do I not have 2 PlayStation av chords
Video games the sequel: less of a movie
Ronald Mac and I literally made the sequel to video games
Lol
But also how good sonic 2 was for the time.
I played like an hour of sonic 2 yesterday and it just made me appreciate how good sonic mania is.
That horrifies my capitalist sensibilities.
They still just announce over twitter: "tomorrow!"
That's pretty shady
Lol
I need to beat Earthbound first.
What day?
Lol
Btw mac
I want to play!
https://youtu.be/j8-KTdNdizE
Mac you should really watch this to catch up
i would give her so much shit
emily moon one of my friends in high school did that
http://steamcommunity.com/id/griffinmcelroy

like a clan that just meets up in game to do bible study
i wonder if i can find a relgious-centered clan

I'm woke
*not for babies* üò¶
"we are an 18+ clan looking to get a large number of players who are serious about pvp"
it definitely is not a game that rewards precision
its just like playing halo with a controller
eh
i wish there was a way to find a bloomington clan
you should be my destiny wife
Asher
and magic
it literally is what if halo 3 had a good story
the emotes are so good
oh yeah dawg
i feel like im going to hate the people
it's persona themed
i joined a clan on reddit
lol
because i know you can play with your na psn friends regardless of the server
im not sure how the na servers are split
we live two different lives
lol
then i played again
and there was an update
then i went to class
ive been playing since 7
my character has a dope ass lifesteal though
I'll just have to get gewd enough for senpai to notice me
i dont think there is a way to find a way to play with them...
apparenty r/polygon is just about hating polygon
there is no discord ill check twitch
thats a good suggestions
oh shit
How do I find griffin on this?!??
Look at this pretty boy
lol the big bad in this game is just literally thanos
I'm a space man
destiny 2 is pretty dope
or even have a predesigned narrative
its almost like it wasn't designed to be conherent
i never understand why the arm helps
this shit is crazy
christ
yeah
is he even present at the conveince store meeting?
only because he has no origin
and then saw Judy "the face of god" and repented
my thought was that he was a malignant force that came from BOB
and we know bob and mike were basically one at a time
because we know bob came from judy
I'm just very interested in what judy's relationship with Mike is
differnent times?
gotcha
i mean i thought everyone in the convience store was connected
of a younger mrs tremond
so that could work with the whole time thing
arent there theories that the grandson is supposed to represent leland
gotcha
didnt the second mrs tremond give cooper the letter from the diary?
ah
in fwwm
mrs tremond is credited as mrs chalfont
maybe making him realize what was going on
so the repitition of the events would have triggered his memories
becaue dale went through that same interaction when Donna brought him to where she thought mrs.
tremond was
because in the original series mrs tremond says they purchased the house from the chafonts
im just thinking as to why there is the repitition though
and the chafonts who sold the house are who we know as the tremonds
See my thoughts were that alice tremond is the real mrs tremond
that's the third instance where we get a character named tremond who isn't consistent
I'm just saying
no i know
yeah her name is also mrs tremond
oh you mean the other woman?
alice tremond
yeah it is
but she could also be completely different because in the original series they go back to the tremond house and there is a competely different woman there
because we could assume that the woman in the palmer house was a past or alternate version of mrs.
tremond
I think its sort of like title or something
also with the whole treemond thing
see it gets really hard when you realize everything isnt inherently in chronological order
yeah
that phillip jefferies is trapped?
so is the zone sort of the limbo between the two universes?
"it is in our house now"
you should join phil and i when we watch it saturday
you think he was seeking out judy?
I thought he was seeking out naido
i dont see why else she would be there
and could have put audrey there for some reason
it would make sense because bad coop would have known about the other dimension
thats what i thought since coop finds the letter on the stand
like who even was the dead body
pretty fucking freaky
I agree with you though that if it was just lynch that's season would have been kinda garbage
10/10 actually.
What a good show
I really like the theory in response to this one
Does it explain that fucked up sex scene?
So much
<@&227443709560619010> I like Saint Pepsi now
but it was just metal gear....
thought it was knack baby

RONALD
Join call.
Hey Mac
wow
did you watch the video?
<@!127535721857679362>
"Ill have you know sir I beat deadspace, and i only had to sleep with the lights on for three nights"
üë∂ <:blueboy:352580077671677952>
we are babies
and i breed bugs
you only eat bread and spend all your money on amiibos
fuck
what if we are just babies?
what if he is right
mac
wait
shit
*who lives in his grandparents basement and collects comics*
"excuse me sir?
Do i look like a baby to you?
Ill have you know i am a big boy"
the whole time
with rabbids open
i had my switch out on the counter
THE GAMES FOR BIG BOYS
HE WANTS THE SERIOUS GAMES
that man is just actually an idiot
i just like the playstation more
but see i don't even not like the xbox
lol
the fact that someone could not like the switch blows my mind
i beat the game in 2 hours
and id know
i would beg to differ
oh im sorry mac
sir?
excuse me?
"it was too cartoony, i was expecting something that wasnt just for kids"
he did say it was "too cartoony"
actually
winston is the bitch character
he was wearing a fucking overwatch winston shirt
what kind of arrogant prick thinks he has the right to call botw easy?
stupid baby game
lol
isnt that game for switch though?
this man is a serious gamer
this man was not a jokester
mac
as the dumbest thing you could do at a game store
literally everything he did was like a sketch we would come up with
and lost 100 dollars?
yeah you know the nintendo switch

I need you to call me in a bit
Ongmdifhdjsbd
Omg mac
My new favorites rack icon
half of nintendo's branding relies on dabbing
with a tripod set up in our living room
when i was half naked covered in blue paint
i cant believe my parents didnt say anything
at least i wasnt in blackface in our satire project
even worse
because we were old enough to know better
nothing is as cringe worthy as our sophmore satire project though
hopefully albinism
ü§∑
and looking like she is about to cry
and walked him around outside carrying an umbrella over him
we had stefan be a albino person while ronald played his mother
it is actually offensive
the albinism one we made is way worse
that sort of group trauma
because its the reason phil ronald and i are still really good friends
in hindsight im so glad i did it
yeah....
lol
im pretty sure i did almost all the cinematography and ronald did all the editing
i love how after i made that i watched it an somehow though "yeah this is good enough to turn in as a school project"
that's why i said it is racist
yeah...
i think the one you got was perfect
mac i'm at home but can we get a ":blueboy:" emojii?
i dont remember any of this
i have definitely aged the least
im excited for phil and ronald to see this
lol
i love how speed equals distance over time wasnt brought up once
pretty sure
im pressure we got a c for that mls
i dont even know
dude
im trying to get my dad to find it
you should really see our albinism one
it is gold
im so glad this video exists
this video literally stops time
this feels like it has been going on forever
we desrved the grade we got on this
with annotations
ps3
im playing poing on my ps4
this is racist
my dad just found this
lol
@everyone https://youtu.be/1SmIA1nUrIw
i cant wait to have a son
midboss fight
well i thought you meant if the visual style looked like the cutscene
lol
i recognized the music
we live in an amazing time
lol
oh i thought you meant the other weird snake game made my the guy who made katamari
this reminds me more of hohokum
the sound board is perfect
the sfx are probably my favorite part
I'd be shocked if there are not 4 more of these in my lifetime
I
this is also for sure going to become a franchise
but maybe you do it again in hard mode
im shocked they didn't do 64
and i think 8 levels per worlld
because there are 4 worlds
i think there are only 32 levels
also rabbid mario is just literally a porn star
so it wouldn't vibe well
i feel like wario would have to be a post game or dlc character because his personality is too close to the rabbids
literally the only thing this game is missing is wario
ie wario
i hope they add characters in the dlc
rather than just embracing it
the made it try to look like it isnt linear
it is just a bit tedious
except its got a sort of collectable mentaility to the world design which is okay
gameplay is super fast too which i love
yeah it is great
It is hilarious.
It's usually mario is the straight man and Luigi is the goof but they do so well when they are both serious
Mario and Luigi are such good straight men
Is so fucking good
This rabbids game
Yeh
Nice
Idk which one that is.
It's the 30 year old man riding a balloon to make maps
Tingles name isn't interestingg
Not good enough.
I'd be happy with even a grave sight that could be interpreted as his
Even ganon
I think you should be able to pay 100 dollars and have a special orb in botw like all the other special abilities.
But instead of calling on a ghost bird to help you fly in the air, tingle just comes down from the sky and just murders anything you are fighting.
I saw it in his ducking beady ass devil eyes
Henry knew
The only reason they aren't called rabbits is for copyright issues
I can say that rabbids are a fair and accurate representation of a rabbit.
As someone who has lived with a rabbit
Just like a real rabbit
Rabbids are dumb but their gimmick is that they are batshit shit insane and also evil.
Because minions are dumb.
That's their gimmick
Yeah they are
Lol
I wish it was like fire emblem and I could marry Luigi to rabbid peach.
I'll choose mega hard then
Cool
And just fucking fail at cartoon chess
If rabbids has a difficulty I'm going to choose the hardest.
Oh wait.
For honor but it's all the popular characters from different Nintendo franchises.
And those are all the modern Ubisoft games I know.
With Luigi
Assassins creed
Or the happy mask salesman?
Kilton?
I still probably won't get the dlc until I get bored again
Friendly?
I thought it makes it so every monster is cautious of@you
I wish there were more roleplaying options in zelda.
So benevolent.
Nintendo you are so gracious.
!!!!!!
I need the majora amiibos and whatever else I need to get the tingle set
Mac
Nice
But botw amiibos are so useful that I want them all
See I don't like having amiibos unless I really like a character or you give it to me
üò¶
Nice.
Is the tingle amino humanly possible?
I get to play rabbits today!!
Just do it appears on my master file.
I really want it
God I fucking love the idea of these crazy motherfuckers running around giving people their shit.
And by puzzles I mean they put down a rock and if you move the rock you've solved their "rock puzzle"
Which is why the only thing they do all day is set up random "puzzles" where they reward you with shit.
But because they are eternal they have all gone batshit insane
And koroks are eternal.
Hylandians live about 120
Bird people live about 70
Zora live about 300
Btw this is my theory Gorons live about 30 years
They are just sexy orbs with tentacles.
They have no anthropomorphic features.
Just guardian orbs
Not even guardian men
So now she has to look at me every time she masturbates
Doing he goofy wave pose.
I put myself in all three of the photos
She doesn't need a boyfriend.
But now she gets to jack off at those sexy photos you took
What do you think about the lady who is dating a sphere?
I'll get it if a) it ever drops in price or b) I get an amiibo that works in it.
Cool
Does hard mode start you over?
I want to
I killed the lynels.
Using tricks.
Lol
It ieven says so in the wuest
Horses don't live 100 years
Yeah.
Except it's a "descendant of Zeldas" horse
But I love the idea of how they geographically designed that.
It's the only giant horse in the game.
So you can easily see how Gannon got a horse of that breed
Which is really cool because it is endemic to the plain right by gerudo valley
That horse is the same breed as ganondorfs
Kind of but that's not really all of it
I need to stock up on some better weapons.
Ew
He's honestly probably the coolest character in the game.
Because I'm pro and my horses don't die
I've never gone back though.
Yeah close to the beginning
He's so big
I got the big horse last night
Oh mac
One of the reasons why I haven't gone back to read homestuck is because I want to beat earthbound stil
üëçüèæ
You'll probably need to read it first before you play anyway.
lol you could just read homestuck for the fox music.
Mainly earthbound and friendship
I don't know if it was directly inspired I just know tony fox did a lot of the music for homestuck and they are both inspired by a lot of the same sources and themes.
I got present at the time but never read after.
I never finished it though.
Only because the homestuck fanbase is fucking huge.
It'll probably sell better than undertake.
Yes?
Hmm
Mac you should teleport back to 2010 and read it all
Lol
It's sort of like your webcomic but worse.
Twin peaks, homestuck, sonic being good?
What fucking hear am I living in?
join call to cheer me on
give me five to finish this assignemnt though
it
do

It looks like my handwriting but what the fuck.

I found this in the back of one of my notebooks
I wonder if I did anything.
Everytime I see her she looks very unpleased by my presence.
It was awkward so I just left.
I just saw Miriam and congratulated her on getting engaged and she looked at me like I was about to follow it up with an insult.
And flagellate in the middle of class.
Bring your rosaries
Pray before every class
Yes I have strayed from the path in many occasions, but through the grace and glory of our lord and savior,*Jesus Christ*, this class shall bring me one step closer to salvation.
I have been saved 8 times.
Or I guess it's online so you can't show off your jesus knowledge.
That's how you should introduce yourself to the class
Shit.
Sorry.
My bad.
Ronald im really curious as to what's going to happen once you actually know about Jesus.
Sounds like they can't teach you anything.

i hate novels
I've only read 2 of the books so I have to do twelve
or actually 14 in total
in my literature seminar we have to read a novel a week
Everytime I see all these pretty women it makes me wish I had the ability to speak to any of them, rather than just messaging them over the internet like a creep
why would they lump ancient and medieval
that's a fucking dumb sounding class
I forgot how atrractive women my age are
what class
lol
and W-385 "what even is an independent clause"
my class is basically R-450 How to interpret fingerpaintings

I get free tickets.
And condoms
Games and books
Only two things I buy on Amazon.
I was about to say.
The only reason they exist is because they are the closest thing to an Amazon store.
My cousin works there.
I don't like him.
He ain't my boy
I hate best buy
No one will want an snes.
The greenwood toy r us is si shitty.

he just leaves
wow
play dotes with me
ronald
good job
you added two songs
hey
and jsr was mostly japanese
all the people making it look french
yeah
because they wanted to make a soul succesor to jsr
its not i just look it up the devs just got the composers
http://thegia.com/archive/xbox/jsrf/art1/char06.jpg
considering he is literally a jsr character
also jsr is just the music lucio listens to/makes
they use it to like bring it home or right before they drop the beat
and it definitely doesn't get repetitive
the vocal stuff they use in the original they only use for like the chorus or something
you only think its more repetitive because you can hear the vocal sounds more distinctly
same with the melody
the beats in the entire song are just the same 5 second loop
its video game music
lol
not like actual vocals
its basically just a soundboard
its all shit like "ha" "pressure" and "come on"
they don't even know whay they mean
yeah
they are just using certain words for their sounds
so they aren't singing
they just use english words for their rhythm
the lyrics aren't really in english in the jsr
i never really compared those two
it is so much like the splatoon soundtrack
shit
its just music
because it's not really video game music
if you don't like the genre of jsr though you probably wont like the ost
have you listened to the space channel 5 ost?
the year majoras mask came out
in 2000
that a game has a hip hop soundtrack
i mean you have to think of how dope it is
but it is very different from jsr
i still think the jsr future ost is really good
they got a couple of the main composers for the second
there were a bunch of songs composed by different people in the first
with pretty much completely different people
thats a completely different soundtrack
it also has a bunch of liscensed songs
especially considering it came out for dreamcast
it good
of the music?
space channel 5 is third
jet set is second
katamari is my most listend to soundtrack
and played it
yes
lol
?
i love constructing history from tiny personal sample sizes
love it
its just like the diary of some random girl in the 16th century who luckily knew how to write
its not like the diary of some war general
but its not going to be like "primary" source about anything
love that
its just going to be reading a lot of diaries and shit
which is legit my favorite
its all about micro history
im excited for one of mine
and just talk with asher's dad
I feel like we should just go over to ashers house sometime
S'ice
I just want like the general idea of computers
i don't want to take one of his classes
to give me a personal lecture on the history of computers
i want ashers dad
s'ice
he has 10x more followers than me
lol i wish asher were here
s'ice
i think you mean
https://twitter.com/NEnsmenger
oh wait...
Lol what doofus said that
I now work for the Indiana University School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering.
S‚ÄôICE, S‚ÄôICE Baby!
wait is that for real?
lol
"Loud boy, careful not to irritate"
i wrote a note on the guy's account
he was mad because he thought i skipped over him
no surprisingly
I fucking hate people
with people in it
in a store
who even fucking does that
some guy just fucking yelled at me
omg
you playing a 20 year old game
i love this
lol
why?
because i already have a terrible time focusing in class
which scares me
just most of the criticism is that she is boring though
thats fair
j400
and there are like 20 reviews
the prof has the lowest "ratemyprof" rating ive ever seen
the hardest class of tmy semester
im scared
im trying to motivate myself to do my homework
I will
I haave done nothing my whole shift
lol
its like the perfect game for someone under 11 with a low attention span
yeah it sells pretty consistently
its such a 2004 game
imaginators is a great idea executed poorly
itll be back
that's because their latest game sucked
lol
why not mr.
skylander
ew
actiVision
the big v
ooof
and that's why they all failed
like no other companies had the balls to try to make their mascot a racist charicature
but no one else has done a human
and so many countries tried to duplicate it with sonic and crash
mario is realy the first video game marketing mascot
you know whats interesting
lol
just like when i found out all my favorite gba games were actually snes game
who thinks this is a new game
because there is some eight year old with a switch'
its funny
yeah
megan said the same thing
it does what nintendon't
so fresh
so new
its not at all like mario or megaman
sonic the hedgehog?
HEY HAVE YOU GUYS HEARD OF THIS GAME?
you sound like me when i played metal gear solid for the first time
lol
so maybe she got farther
and then megan took it from me
i literally booted it up
act 1?
greenhill zone?
umm
I'm like half way
scratch that
I'm only like a third the way through
idk yet
the story mode?
also I can have monster npcs live in my village
oh yeah
but hes ugly
i also have a troll as a pet
its like a bat thing
no
I have a pet monster
also
oh shit
with these statues that shoot fire
I also have a danger room
then the rest of the buildings are for the npcs
10% for npcs
i have a castle and 90% of it is for keenan
i live in a greenhouse i made for myself
no
yeh
its like some mc esher shit
my place in dqb has gotten fucking crazy mac
minecraft is too casul for me
and dragon quest builders
i'm that good in dwarf fortress
and llamas
and a bunch of japanese house that don't fit the aesthetic
except with a giant cube
aww
bring your dog
i feel neglected
hmmmmmmmmm
and you said yes?
but didn't give a time
so people asked you if you wanted to hang
and your'e saying yes, unless another friends asks to hang with you
that i am asking if you will hang with me
so what you are saying is
how do you not know your schedule 24 hours in advnace?
are you free to play dota with me tomorrow afternoon/morning?
mac
hey
^
and want him to be happy
but because i love asher
not because of clara
im concerned about asher right now
k
lol
because then we'd have to figure out what to do after graduation
literally the only difference is she doesnt live with me
no
now compared to when we were dating?
lol
for you
how is it different>?
is it not?
nah
i see henry all the time, you arent missing much
i mean now that megan is pretty much there when you are
so what do you think now?
lol
fuck
i forgot about this
‚î¨‚îÄ‚î¨Ôªø „Éé( „Çú-„Çú„Éé)
were you friends with megan
mac what are your stakes in this?
lol
oh
?
because that is a healthy way to deal with things
i have beer and whisky if you need it
lol good luck man
phil and i are going to watch some lucha tonight, you wanna join?
shit
good bonding time
hey
<@!127535721857679362>
this will be a good thing to read today at work
guess i do
oh wow
i dont even have a different browser
trying to hack me
nice try mac
And I won't learn bad habits.
I feel like if i just learn form you guys rather than figuring out shit in my own.
The learning curve to at least be a "beginner" will go faster.
üòÑ
I need to be told what to do the whole time.
I refuse to play a game at least for now without being supervised.
But here's the thing
And then I can practice is Zorro when he comes out
Maybe I should have like 3 heroes I practice with now?
I'll get there.
This is literally my dream
I can have an axolotl follow me around
Omg
I need to be able to play with real people by the time my pangolin buddy comes out
But I'll assume it is
I don't know if that is a joke
The pangolin has spoken to me
@everyone I need a coach
Cool it plays just like fire emblem
I like physical copies
Ik
Yeh

Mac did I ever show you what I got?

hey <@!71716577669550080>  until dawn has the guy from mr robot in it
I'm surprised the cgi reddit is filled with more nick memes
lol
lol
My biggest hope for ultra sumo is that they will redesign the ui
Yeah that looks so fucking good
Lol
I could easily play gen 2 in japanese
lol.
If you want one I'll swing by tokyo and grab us some
I almost bought one for us
Yeah
They did that with red and blue in japan
Me too
Mac which version you getting?
And the new rockdog form
Every year it just gets closer to digimon.
Set Pok√©mon hype to "yes"
Fuck fuck fuck fuck
Link?
Are you as strong as a piledriver?
Lol
Lol
<@!125452744440938497> heading home
Is this a dota thing?
he put them in your bag
Probably around 9:10
Cool.
I'll message you when I'm heading home.
<@!125452744440938497> are you coming over once I get off work today?
I guess.
I'm just v confused
I have t had anything to drink
I bet you Indiana farmers hate that they can't keep up with the latest vegetable trends
I always see someone my age asking about avocados
Everytime I go to the farmers market
Micro transactions
Seperate
We well that seperwte
No
Just oranges
Just says: organic raw marmalade
We should start a booth at the farmers market mac
Not this orange goosh
Give me some avocado on toast please
Why would you even
Eww
Ronald is that legit though because it said it is like jam so I sort of believe you
That's worse than apple butter
Ewwwwwww
#marmagate
if you were born before 1985 please explain this mystery to me
please save me from my ignorance
bio: help i am millennial i dont know
@whatismarmalade
I gotta make a twitter account
It looks really thick
I think I've seen marmalade and I don't think that's it
I don't even know if you are fucking with me
But lemonade?
It's like orange juice?
Okay I just looked it up
Marma?
Is it lemonade made from.
Lol
What is marmalade
A lot of these sound like fun articles.
Lol
So they could midnight release.
Poor comics:-( they wish they were video games
There's no one here.
I'm probably going to leave though.
Literally ironman
I'm not even joking.
It is literally called batman metal.
Specifically batman metal
Iron man
I'n going to laugh if it's just me
Apparently they are doing a midnight release
I'm at the comic book store
rather than having to scramble to find one
itll probably be good to have time to search for jobs in indy during this
thatll keep you busy too
also good juob
wtf
i just learned phoenix wright is supposed to take place in la
what if i drive you?
üñïüèø
lol
right now?
but with wario
it is literally super bomberman r
mac come over and play wario blast with me
I gotta work on my brand
interseting
hmm
oh
because i use it to ask people random questions, as if it was an email
it makes so much sense now why people don't respond to my dm's over twitter
lol
does it have indisious connotation?
that's it?
<@!125452744440938497>  please don't make fun of me.
But what does sliding into DM's mean?
Let me know how sonic is.
I probably won't get it until this weekend.
That's why they keep remaking them with better mechanics
Each takes place in a completely different planet with only some constants in the world.
Also none of the stories blend into each other.
Then it's one of the YouTube movie cuts of the game
I guess if it is just cutscenes.
Lol
Also I like the idea that if they can make a game that combines 3 2d platformers with the same story in each into one then they can also merge 6 100 hour jrpgs with completely different characters and plot in each into one game.
Gameplay is almost identical to sa2 though
And this same year they are making a game that combines the best 3D sonics into one
Mac are you going to become a sonic fan now?
Lol
For everyone mac doesn't take ronald you should take one
Smart
Good call
Asher's just a light weight.
That's the only way they kick in
You are supposed to take one every hour for six hours
Ronald
Just to get your money's worth
You should probably take two more
<@!127535721857679362>
Ronald
Save yourself
Because you were crying about your friends ignoring you.
Shit
Ship
Mac on a scale to 1-5 how high are you right mow
Lol
Go hang with her
Where is your mom?
I'm sorry bud
Lol
Mac you look 3 feet tall in that
Lol
Lol
Lol
And it'll be hilarious.
If he does.
He will just throw up
Omg
Lol
Mac is pretty high.
Lol

I'm going to get wasted
In my town
GARFILED
WE NEED TO GO
CARDINAL STAGE IS PUTTING ON A GARFIELD MUSICAL
GUYS.
HOLYSHIT
Even though it did hurt a lot of people which isn't cool
Of just being an asshole kinda
So nicks vices are sort of refreshing.
Most comedians are either suicidal or rapists
Honestly though.
And dumb.
This is why you only work with your brothers.
Because he's very similar to nick.
I think he's going to try to take his position.
Did I tell you that the comics journalist I've been following since 2010 got a job a polygon
To the new nick?
Do you think pats going to get a promotion?
But I still hope he comes back in a different way
Yeah.
Polygon 100% right in letting him go
If it's with the same person that's predatorial if it's with different then it is lonely and pathetic
That's what I mean
That's not like predatory behavior unless it is persistent, but it's still not good
Eh.
That's p bad
I'd need to look at the messages
I think the public is right to do what they do, but I don't know if nick is a bad person
I'm trying to find any screenshots of his DMs
I'm scared he will become a martyr for the alt right gaming community.
https://twitter.com/chrisgrant/status/895772905736482816
The 10
Chris grant tweeted it
Kotoku published it
Polygon officially fired him.
You guys seen nicks new post
have any of them commented on it?
lol
I'm gonna hack their web
now i can break in
mac
It's only rated T so don't even worry
Asher I got gravity rush remastered if you ever want to play through it.
Probably sober
You are such a martyr
It's probably the most relaxed you will ever be in your oife
You're going to have a great time
Lol ronald
lol I love it
Too cute
Omg
Omg Mac
From macs angle you look almost angry
That looks so much better than from Macs angle
The best
Remember when this blew your mind?
*you should sneak it into Macs bag and make him your drug mule*
But then I realized they were white.
My cousins used to go on vacations with me all the time with weed and it was always bananas to me as to how they never got caught
I'll pay your bail
üòÉ ty
Lol
Since possession only counts for normal weed
It is just illegal to distribute.
I'm also pretty sure once you buy the edibles it is legal to consume them in any state
Idk if meth produces an odor
P sure it's mainly coke and heroine.
I honestly don't even think they train drug dogs for marijuana, because if someone smelt like it that'd be inconvenient
I can't imagine a drug dog would be tipped off by the smell of watermelon sours
Especially if you keep them in your carryon
But I've taken so many illegal things through immigration that I can't imagine some cough drops would be hard
I used to think that
Lmao
Lol
How does Macs mom feel about it
Should bring back some
Lol the fucking future.
Did you get the zootsrocks?
The future
Oh shit
Who'd you buy drugs from?
This is the whitest thing I've ever seen.
That's the best substitute considering Hatsune miku can't sign it
Lol
That is an aesthetic
Lol
That's close
At least your lanyard is in the picture
He looks younger than asher
Is that Asher's chip zdarsky?
I'm so glad i didn't come
ah
at this
so you are both on your computers
are you guys just both on your computers in the aibnb?
because their references are so fucking esoteric sometimes, that I only get because of some random slumdog millionare-like reason
yeah tbh i don't know how most people listen to it
awww üòÉ
how is the asher-mac bonding time?
lol
when does ronald get there?
cool
have you guys done anything in seattle yet?
nice
no one selling like handmade lina body pillows
but its just all pretty much valve sponsored merch
lol ew
:/
like cool vendors>?
are there any vendors?
lol
lots
lost of cosplay?
nice
how is the demographic there compared to C2E2?
have you guys meet gaben yet?
maybe the game is haunted
the fuck does that even mean
so apparently the producer of the ace attorney series has said that they really want to released the dgs for the west, but there are "certain circumstances" that make it difficult right now
at least it is a shitty collection just like the first one
ha that's pretty funny
and they all look so fun
also i'm looking at all the capcom japanese exclusive 3ds games
is legacy collection 2 not coming for 3ds?
?
also i saw on polygon that most of the na teams are gone?
sell it for 39.99 easy
since the first three games were all gba they could easily be ported
I'm surprised capcom hasn't released an ace attorney collection for the 3ds
yeah
so im sure they will want to space them out a bit
because the most recent phoenix wright gamecame out in the states early 2016
i just think itll be about a year
I think they will localize dai gyakuten saiban though
and resident evil 7 before that
ace attorney was the last actual game they made
and street fighter and monster hunter are just remasters
2 bundles in the same year
megaman legacy 2
resident evil collection
lol im looking at capcom chronologically
that's pretty good considering physical copies go for like 50 now
nice
yeah
the only new game they really have rn is mvc infinite and the new ace attorney
well hopefully then i can get that new ace attorney game
lol
didn't capcom specifically say they had no intentions of localizing it?
i thought no us release was confirmed?
would you buy the japanese version?
nice
<@!125452744440938497> I want to take her to goth prom

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwOcI5ANVi0
Saved Megan and I 120 bucks
And told them I bought them in my phone.
I just walked in through the accessibility entrance.
Did I tell you I got in the shedd aquarium for free?
Which are super easy to buy in all colors.
It's easier to do at concerts where all they have is wristbands
And make a bunch of fakes that you go outside and sell one at a time in desperation.
What I'm saying is you keep a real one
Not before
As you are going in
After you get in
Just go up to people in the ticket line and look worried and in a hurry
Also no one is going to check for the radio chip
Got invest to make money
Another grift you could get going is printing out fake week ids and going up to people saying you have a family emergency and have to leave and if they'd be willing to buy them off of you for really cheap
If that's true he lost thousands of dollars
It's all about the look
Exactly.
You could where a nice suit and go up to dumb looking people and say you are a streaming producing looking for casting personalities and make them fill out a survey that has a $10 deposit fee

I feel like ti would be a good place to get a grift going.
they are the only ones that don't overbook
southwest is the best airline
what airline does your mom work for?
lol wut if everything is full
are you guys not flying together?
dota = wolveine
except one is wolverine and the other is iron man
captain america and black panther are basically the exact same
doesn't matter the actual powers
thor = wolverine easy
nah man
I guess he is an iron man
doctor strange is difficult
= wolverine
fantastic four
yeah dawg
wolverine = bad accident
iron man = smart accident
wolverine was experimented on
captain america was given drugs
what do you mean?
he was
flash = wolveine
no
plasticman = wolverine
superman = wolverine
lol
i'm pretty sure we hacked comics
black widow = wolverine
captain america = wovlerine
spider-man = iron man
the hulk = wolverine
there are like 30 batmen
dc does that all the time
so they can sue
someone should tell disney
oh damn
unsure
hmm
so mrs.
invisible then?
yeah
mr fantastic
cool
its also a lot more difficult to follow when i am only looking at it every 30 second
because i don't know why certain characters works together and whatnot
i guess i also need to lots of explanations during drafts
coo
lone druid is just jungling?
but i want to know what they were trying to do
and get ganked
or they are going across the map
but then run away
sometimes they attack
eh
because that's never clear
or "this person is running away"
like there should be a pop up that says "this guy is trying to kill this person right now"
i just want to know their individual motivations
I just need to know what is going on
although thats not very helpful
yeah
searing chains?
what is going on
i have no idea
i do
i like 1 because its a horror game
its just an action game though
its pretty okay
yeah
and bits of 2 and 4
and zero
ive only played 1
i still need to play 7
yeah
kinda like resident evil origins
so revelations is just a way to continuye the more popular one
because the resident evils are loosely connected narratively
and wanted it to continue
yeah kinda except the reason why revelations exists is because people were really invested in the 4 plotline
that has an entire other series between two of its games
because there is another series that does that
i'm trying to think
so its just the story
its just between 4 and 5 i think
almost nothing
sorry i was working
resident evil revelations is like a tangental series
its like actual sports
lol
they look like real people
ah
yeah thats the one im watching
im just playing it full screen at work
i cant
ah
it was no different
it didn't
ik but during it
i don't see the overlays
will radiant win
it doesnt help that its muted
thank yuo
just cahnged it
i am
!
i guess i am
i sometimes wonder if im even watching the same games as you
also apparently you can unlock free mode
and now that im getting to know the npcs its awesome that they all have personalities
yeah dude but 81 different types of rooms
i mean i just mute the tv
there are 81 different room recipes
because i listen to actual music
i still love it
it has so much more complexity than i was anticipating
dqb gets fucking wild
mac
its the only game with actual characters
yeah]
agreed
i forget how good dota looks when it isn't running on my computer
Lol fuck
Like a fucking pro
Poached

Love that Wii draw studio
why does the steam version sims 3 have to be pc only üò¶
Dqb just makes me want to play sims
Monkey
Monkey

Monkey movie
Yeah
K wanna go to monkeys at 5 I'm taking phil for his birthday
Have you been on the cgi subreddit?
Which is the only scenario I would pick her
Because it'd 100 be pearl on team coffee
I want coffee v tea
Ewwwww
My senses didn't need to be offended
Lol
No.
But begans were all against ketchup
I played 2 rounds.
I can't believe mayo won
They should have just launched minecraft 2
Yeah but that's not and excuse
It's a game for children?
It's like what if minecraft was made by competent people.
It's a fucking weird game.
And I love it.
I played through the first one a lot
Lol
üò¶
hiint of what
he has a problem but still
he drinks a lot
it could have been v different
i dont know the details though
not justifying it, its just interesting
it kinda sucks that his career might be ruined because he was probably drunk and dumb
hmm
links?
but itd be interesting to know still
like anything would be bad
i wonder what actually happened
hes a genius
mac and i were super into him
my innocence
^
this is why i have trust issues
now nick robinson
first bill cosby
üò¶
Thank god they already released the cool games inc for this week
Link?!?
D-:
Was he drunk
üòÆ
I think she has more hours in splatoon than I do
She will play for me
Nah.
Megan's got that
If that's still cool
I'm coming back from Chicago so I'll probably be home around 9-10
Saturday night works
My tonsils are fine now
Asher.
<@&227443709560619010> when are we going to play katamari and watch lucy?

eh i just bought the normal edition
think i shold get the mask?
lol
thanks
fuck
I can't find it on amazon
<@!71716577669550080> are they not doing a physical release of absolver?
thank god
I just realized i can play cars 3 on the switch
not even close
no
I just got one that crudely said  "you are valid"
the splatoon messages are getting amazing
The rest are just things I'd pick up if I ever see them.
Cloud
I'll just check out Amazon.
I only want one amiibo that I don't have.
I'll check it out today.
Hmm
I do
For the preorder
Normally when I buy from Amazon I only get 5 off
Hmm how I do that?
But I just want the cheapest splatoon
And then I save coupons so I can also get more off
I get extra as employee
20 dollars cheaper.
52 but I'd get it for 40
In need to stop buying games new
We just got splatoon in used
Goddammit!
When
You should have known introducing any subject would create a patented Mac-Keenan fight.
Fuck off
K Mac.
K Mac.
If you can save thousands of dollars it is.
Not all the classes work like iu
It's a different academic structure.
You don't know what you are talking about mac
It's literally a commuting campus
A lot of students commute there
That's what Philips mom does.
Who teaches there.
Have you thought about commuting?
Yeah I feel like the whole of iupui is geared towards people who live in Indy
But I think the freedom of having control over you'll whole life will maybe ease that a bit
Being cynical is probably a proper response.
Do you think you are ready?
Probably not a good sign man.
Could be a pretty cool and liberating chapter honestly.
üòï
If you are just living in Indy getting an apartment would be way cheaper than living in student housing.
Student housing tends to be more expensive if you aren't in schooarship
Ooof
What a loser
ronald?
even i made my picks
come on ronald
i just want to play splatoon
ü§∑üèø
remember when we played minecraft
hey guys
This sounds like some post modern novel
I'll start sending our wedding rsvps for 2076
I've been in the longest relationship of my life and didn't even know it.
Lol
Like I said I've trapped myself in a cycle.
lol yeah
2014
Last cycle.
But it wasn't dating.
We hung out/made out for a hot minute.
I don't know.
Honestly.
I'll probably respond and keep it super superficial
Yup
Or just let it float
Ronald should I respond?
Not even named in the scripy
She's just a background character
She doesn't even have her own character arc
Lol
Every night.
I should tell her that I know.
I've been trapped in her dreams for the last month
Which you know doesn't mean anything but it's still interesting that she's in a relationship.
She's dating a woman
Only if you've been dreaming about me.
i had to call att because apparently they lost my check
lol
that'd be like if japan was playing emerald by the time red and blue came out
that means there were 3 ace attorney games out in japan before the us got them
but not in the us until 2005
it is crazy to me that the game came out in 2001
especially considering ive only played phoenix wright for 11 hours
that's pretty good
thats like a fifth of the way
im 10 hours in
otherwise i will never play it again
i also have to make sure i beat disgaea before rabbids comes out
yeah but its a fighting game that tricks you into thinking it's dark souls
i doubt you will play it as long as i will
probably not
i gotta beat absolver
beat mario, rabbids, metroid, and everything else
i don't know how you are going to do it mac
^
with a smash-like fighter
we need a gritty reboot of the humongous franchise
ill get you it for your birthday
we got time
we will see
if it doesnt have online play ill get it for ps4
i doubt itd have local multiplayer but idk
worst thing IVE ever done
100%
or ps4?
should i get marvel superheroes 2 for swithc
also important question
with our nostalgia cutlure and steam sales
actually millennials are probably the only thing keeping it alive
its not their fault the genre died
idk they had so much success but then dissapeared because they could only make one game
i feel so bad for humongous entertainment
so i'm surprised im even still in that consciousness.
The crazy thing is that she has pretty much done a 180 in terms of her identity
That every 3-4 years just pops up.
I feel like this is just a permanent installation in my life

<@!125452744440938497> ^

Keenan can't play it
I will pitch this to Mr.
Bachelor
And we both realized how great a fake dating show would be.
I was watching the show asher recommended and there's an episode where he creates a fake dating show just to meet women.
There is only this now.
I threw away all my comics and video games.
This is my new dream
This is not a joke ronald
Without it being obvious.
And you have to try to be as unappealing as possible
And I want to make you the man that ten women compete over
I'm going to produce a dating show
Ronald
Lol
K go play pubg
Megan killed family üòÉ
Lol
That's great
lol I just looked
?
?
Then
Yeah but asher will be at my house them
We are hanging tomorrow
You cant do whatever
Tomorrow we will when to play something different.
Lol

I'm excited to give you shit.
Neon pink and green are such a good combo
Lol
So you know wut guns do
Yeah but lvl 28 means you've at least played more than 1 match

Asher
Never heard of it
No I use a lot of references so I needed to do something on the boat from my noggin
Lol

I did a fun robo boy on a boat yesterday
Make is faster and sketchier
I wanted to make it more fluid looking
Yeah
Like his face is oatmeal
He looks like a nasty boy

But I wanted to use a brush.
Normally I use a very small pen
Most endangered animals are tagged
Tags
He's like batman but for turtles.
He's been tracking her.
Making sure she's safe
The guys walks up onto the beach and asked me if I saw a turtle
It's crazy though about 30 minutes after she went back into the wayer
Yeah
Yeah
I spotted another Loch Ness monster last night

Two
I should bring someone so i can get teo
I forget easily.
Will you go with me?
Is there a confirmed midnight release?

Waiting in line?

Grifffin is adorable
And people like making characters fuck
Splatoon?
Cat Mario?
Animal crossing?
Almost every Nintendo game is
And the bird guy
Yuuuuuup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xX_owm68ZQ
Lol
It makes me so sad Andy serkis doesn't have an oscar
A little trope heavy but when the tropes are with apes it is more forgivable.
It was just an all around good action movie
It was great because it was a post apocalyptic movie that never called attention to the fact that it was.
Like it didn't rub it in your face.
Asher the planet of the apes movie was probably the best post apocalyptic movie I've seen in a long time.
Vanilla new vegas is still one of the most nostalgic things for me.
Lol
Sounds game changing.
So cool
I almost started crying
I thought she was going to get too scared

She crawled up the beach less than a foot away from me


I just saw a turtle lay her eggs
Guys
Literally bioshock
It's hilarious though.
No clue.
Lol
Ownership transferring is no different than transferring data on my Nintendo 3DS
@everyone we should play minecraft later tonight
Not sassy garf?
I want it without the bottom text part
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl57zJ9IFPU
<@!71716577669550080> shiny tapu koko
so it just uses emojis
I love the idea of a robot that can only communicate through an led screen on its face
^

I like this robot I did on the plane
the internet here is so good
god that mong one is so bad
I don't think he individually pc-checked each one.
I just ignore them.
He got them from the Internet anyway
There are like 8 different racial slurs.
Interesting.
You must have gotten some tame rng then
Lol of everything so far.
That's the problem you have?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2ZCuMXjVTg
it's worth it
you gotta listen to asher's commentary on flubber
yuh
<@!71716577669550080>
minecraft?
guys
Pick number 3 m'lord
Antichrist high would kill you
You can barely watch twin peaks sober
Like you really really really shouldn't.
No
No no
No no no
No no no no
It was me
You got me
I'm guilty
Also i already admitted that I built it
Also the fountain was there when I logged on this afternoon
The progress on my castle shows it wasn't me
So don't tear it down until she gets there
Megan wants to see it
Ugliness
I tried to fuse all our elements so no one could tell
It's no longer fun
It was me
Alright I'm done
Confirmed asher
It was herobrine
Guys here's the thing
I agree
That's Macs mo
It uses laterns
üò¶
It's gotta be asher
Nope
It was you or asher
Mac
This is literally clue
Behwsbbrhrbrbsbbdd
<@!240129712645603329>
Someone is fucking lying.
Someone is lying
Did you build the fountain.
<@!127535721857679362> this is life or death
THE FUCK
That u?
The fountain.
Did you make it?
^
???????!?!?
<@!125452744440938497>
Nerd
McCloud is such a need
they literally just built a new infastructure to fix our wifi
<@!127535721857679362>
roll up that sweet sweet ball in 1080p
Asher when I get back we need to get high and co-op this gem
LOL
but only if it lasts longer than 5 minutes
yeah ik
just realized i cant play splatoon in cayman
I got really sad
mbps
which is why it lasts 5 minuttes
i think my internet is buring the candle at both ends
71.4
lol i just ran an internet speed test
i really think thats a good idea
you sure?
and without being able to place beds, you could stray to far to gather resources
like mining would be almost impossible without being able to place torces
it would still make certain resources really valuable
but you can only build in our area
so you can explore and gather resources
but there is the same border for placing blocks
for breaking blocks
also ronald our idea was to make it so there is no border
how long is it going to be down for>
lol
@everyone ^
there you go
HEY ASSHOLES IT IS GOING DOWN
we came up with an idea of how we want to expand
rona;d
ron i have to stay up until 3 am timorrow so we should play then
we miss you
üò¶
the game
thats when the wifi starts getting better
probably after 9
ill be on later
<@!71716577669550080> I need to go im getting too angry
<@!127535721857679362> can you get on at all today?
when the cube is so small
rails are kinda a waste
lol
üòâ
no
no
and make an embassy for ronald's kingdom
just do what im going to do
it ruins your illusion
but i don't want something coming out of the ground to randomly connect with ronald
yeah but you can get to your base from my castle
maybe if yuo built something mac
i forgot
oh yeah
if you do make it underground
pls
no
No
NO
as being a thing that is hard to get to
i like the idea of a castle ronald
yes
üì£ I DON'T WANT THE BRIDGE üì£
no
stop leaving holes to the jungle
also mac
why
i could blow up both
hmm
monuments get destroyed all the time
does anyone have any sand and gunpowder
speaking of which
after a while i was
and it takes like 5 minutes to get all the way back up
because i keep falling
the tower went so fast until this last part
cool
it's not to far from my place so i can spare the journey
and ill come check it out
let me know when its done
mac honestly your base is the best thing on the server
quit your internship
then play
üò¶
*mac don't give away your secret*
cookie farm
[redacted]
he built the chicken coop
player unknowns battleground
ronald that's just literally pubg
im honestly okay with never expanding if we were to spawn in sugar cane, a cactus, and two cows
what have you built?
yeah mac
my tree
yeah
That's a safe and healthy assumption
<:curse:248225815005757442>
What if I'm always pissed?
But mac
"Doesn't seem like the type of person"

lol she's probably going to get pissed
ah
I didn't think it was that popular
is that true?
Finally my life is fucking complete.
he's got a job
like he's one of those people i thnk i can respect as long as i never have to remember they are a real person
while also being nice and strightforward
but he also makes me think hes groudy
yeah
as far as people i really respect as artists, but just wish they didn't exist in the world as actual people
Lynch i think is a lot like George Condo
the psycho guy
thats how lynch got the guy who plays audrey's son
<@!125452744440938497>  have you seen chained?
that article secures a lot about what i think about david lynch

*the best*
its the tic toc one
he did
and have a layer of nostalgia on them
mainly because they parody some of my favorite movies
the early treehouse of horrors still are my favorite
10 years before i saw twin peaks
i thought that shit was the best when i first saw it
clues
eat the
don't
Chief Wiggum
That's mac
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDa-_Vq51I
<@!71716577669550080>
I have weird priorities
I love how I've seen el topo and holy mountain but not blue velvet
El topo is my favorite of his work
Have you ever seen el topo?
I think even if lynch had full creative control it could have never been better than what jordorowsky would have done
When he doesn't get full creative control it seems
Lynch is sort of a bitch though.
Like yo what extent lynch was familiar with his work.
I'm curious as to what the whole situation with moebius was
Never paid attention to the director
I've seen that movie so many times.
thanks ronald, I worked really hard on it
I just learned that dune was directed by lynch
i feel like such a dummy
i want that lina figurine
;idsfjgjahdfga
ronald can probably reset your inventory to the last backup
üò¶
id shut it down
i never saw anything in the chat about it
what is it?
is the map and stats up on a website?
wait
i sent this to ron
that means super mario galaxy is retro
wtf
the article categorizes "retro" as older than 10 years
you do you
lol
and the publishers are all about it because it minimizes second hand sales
it allows companies like steam and amazon take advantage of the publisher's greediness and create a monopoly
so it's v different now
but that was before the internet
rather than against them
but they decided to actually work with the stores
comics had a similar problem
yeah
honestly it boils down to publishers realizing they can take advantage of the situation
yeah but it's not game world or any of the game store's fault really
https://www.polygon.com/2017/7/17/15974096/what-it-costs-to-run-an-independent-video-game-store

<:ronald:230126993008623616>
help
everyone should be in bed
that's the least popular time for gaming
that's okay
which you are also working on
it will require internet 2
<@!71716577669550080> have you finished minecraft 2 yet?
ronald is like the landlord of oir cyber space
<@!127535721857679362>
Oh no
Give me 10 minute
I'll be on.
I'm just making food
is having someone who has never played a game before play cuphead
it was like a thing they did to promote the game
model
http://media1.santabanta.com/full1/Global%20Celebrities(F)/Kate%20Upton/kate-upton-76a.jpg
I can't believe kate fucking upton gets to play cuphead before me
Since sam didn't get to watch it
If that's cool

Yeah dude

uhhuh
lol okay mac
you and i both no those are even close to comparable
itd be the worst game ever if they weren't
lol
i want to try that
it'd take a year to beat
also i realized that if you do one day of persona a day
yeah but i could be playing persona
i can just do one
plus i like the idea of that if i ever get really really really bored
they are the least interesting part of the game
i also don't really care
theres no reason for me to
lol fuck off
once stardew valley comes to switch
i will
There's just nothing on switch for me until rabbids
Nah I'm still playing recent stuff
It'll be inverted
That'll all change in august
Fair
But I play my ps4 almost everyday.
True
I feel like my switch isn't getting the love it deserves

But I'll move everything else sure
I moved that bed a long time ago
Oh the thing that isn't a hole anymore?

<@!127535721857679362>  WAKE UP
<@!127535721857679362>
<@!127535721857679362>
<@!155893986605793281>  let me know when you up
It sounds over by Asher's neighborhood
I can hear them from work
That's what im saying
Are they doing fireworks near your house
Asher
lol
to write an identical poem?
the biggest mystery of 2017
did anyone ever acutally find out why it was connected to that internet post?
lol
i almost reboguht super star and smb
im so glad i asked
im so fucking jetlagged
im at work
i will
just to light up the tree farm
i only need like 4 pieces
if he did, ill just steal his
does the nether have a perimeter?
he finally got his redstone lamp
oh nice
did you add to it?
i saw it this afternoon?
what area?
yo can i get that list?

because i think she was trying to do something with it but idk
that other one could be yours but maybe talk with megan about that
also just the center mountain
just faces ive seen
idk who specifically though
hmm a lot of people from north
which isn't as great as it maybe sounds
or 26 year olds who want nostalgic college dick
its all either 18 year olds who want college dick
actually yes
whereever you do buddy
going back to bloomington tinder has never made me want to move more
I'm gonna build a mountain of chairs
I'm gonna build a mountain of chairs

I'm gonna build a mountain of chairs
When do you think you are going to update the map btw.
Which is communal
That's literally all I've claimed other than the tree farm
Yeah
Cool
Is it a dsi or ds lite?
Thank you very much.
I'm worried I'm going to rebuy games
Could you let me know all the games of mine you have?
And consoles.
Besides the ps3
Asher
Yeah I think that's where a lot come from
Could mobs spawn from outside the perimeter?
Mac
Glowstone will be v nice
I probably can't get on until I get back from work
Thanks.
Cool just make you keep at least enough for us to make enchanting table once/if we get learher
*most
Mac you aren't wasting diamond are you.
You have lost if it right?
It's still coming from you though right?

Idk dude
I told her
Yeah consider she's asking me whose number 9196662564 is
A text?
She's worried she broke something on the server.
I'll have to tell her
lol she's really scared dude
Idk
Yeah
Lol
?
(317) 938-5222
Probably more than me tbh
Yeh why?
Except for the ship stages
Yeah.
Smb3 level design is garbage though.
Only 1 and 3
But also yes
Shut up
Stan lees wife you mean?
Now he's finally single.
Oh man.
Stan lees wife just died.

I'm hoping I can play tonight.
I just got back.
Llama room?
Lol
I can't play all my PS3 games
I'll get a pc at some point.
You should give me dark souls regardless
I want to play both of those games so bad
I'm makes me miss watching the bachelor.
asher's job may have better availability though
our manager just left at the east side so i effectively make the larger decisions now
regardless i can put in a good word if you get a callback
but being fully available and only being able to work 10 hours a week would be more desirable than somone who could work 30 hours a week but only nights and weekends
yeah no you should prioritize your other job
because nights and weekends are what everyone wants
i mean it would obviously make you less desirable but yeah
then i would get to train you
if you do apply see if you can get an eastside position
which would not be fun compared to the east side
the thing though is that im pretty sure just the west side is hiring
ive been working there since 2014
asher left
ive obviously had ups and downs with management and the owner
and ive never been able to not tolerate anything
i mean ive been there a couple years now
isn't complete ass i mean
and no it isn't
define complete ass?
hey ronald
^
*it's still a bad movie*
im sorry ronald
I feel bad
sometimes i cross the line
üò¶
i was being a big dick
I'm sorry for being mean earlier today
hey <@!71716577669550080>
coo
did we get the seed yet?
i don't even need it now
nah
<@!127535721857679362> the church scene wasn't even creative
Hey <@!127535721857679362> Kingsmen sucks
<@!127535721857679362> Ronald QUICK!!!
the ceo of dow chemical is in our discord and he is looking for someone to go on an exclusive networking cruise with him!

<@!127535721857679362> looking for sexy singles in your area?
HEY <@!127535721857679362>
you are like a bard, singing to us the glories of our past to inspire our futures
you hold onto the our past
i like it
also mac is the seed somewhere
"the perfect storm"
lol
and screaming in russian
he was just watching
also it was funny because he wasn't even playing
because you have met so many dota players
yeah asher
did no one else think my russian kid story was funny?
also
ty
lol ben get off so i can sleep
*keenan will lose all his shits*
and the people bellow are so pissed
there is this city built above another city
that's literally a chapter from guilliver's travels
<@!240129712645603329> how are you still on if you are at work?
you accidentally go too deep mining and you stumble upon my mole kingdom?
you should
this is going to be an interesting test for me
im already such a control freak with other people in mc even when im 1000 blocks away
im going to fucking lose it
and just space
as far as managing resource
god 6 people on this little map is going to be really fun
because i didn't know alt tab was a thing
i just wrote it down
do you remember how to get wood though?
this guy is amaizng
he just recreated the whole of chrono trigger using redstone
he already slayed the ender dragon
he's already on
it is ugly
don't look
come on in m'dude
lol
if i don't take everything super serious and minmax every game i become flaccid
thank ronald, this is the only way i can get hard anymore
then we will just go away and do what we always do
not once it gets big
but oh well
see that sort of detracts from the fun though, becuase then its no longer a map that builds on itself
i guess ill just build a moutain castle then
well
okay
just resources
it doesn't say anything about living
no it doesn't
then can i tear it down?
but once he's finally done with it
i don't see in the rules where it says anything about housing?
also
they are only okay if the person removes them
that i don't agre that accidental uglies are okay
also i forgot to say when i first saw the rules
that's cheating
eww
also you guys have altered stuff
then id have to fly to the coords
not since they were first sent out
so i can do shit in creative?
<@!127535721857679362> can you send me this map btw?
where we live doesn't really matter to me though
i just want to build things to build things
i thought we were going to live together?
and youll build inside the mountain?
and a hall of thte mountain king
good place for a castle
or was that through resource gathering?
did it originally look like it was in an explosion?
also i made us a bucket, so we don't have to live like peasants anymore
because we have enough lava to just smelt coal if we want
i feel like once we get a nice looking tree farm together all the challege will go away
why did you pick this moutain btw?
touring it made me want to make it in minecraft so bad
im so inspired by the desing of edinburgh castle though
and grain if you were lucky
and the fruit you gathered
and poultry
yeah and in realism you would mainly eat fish and eggs
i just don't want to make a huge wheatfarm until i can actually make it graze land
its not like we will actually die from starvation mac
so
so we have apples
we have an oak
eggs, melons, fish
but most of our food should rely on fruits and domestic animals
i'll maybe make a 8x8 thing of wheat for now
no im only going to build in that formula
but we only have enough space right now to get to the domestic part
only llamas, cows and horses would qualitfy as prarie animals
but basically it goes city->mining->fruits and flowers->domestic animals->wheatlands->prarie animals
fuck i cant find it right now
i want to follow a macroregion outline
i agree let me send you what i want
also you know there are sheep in our perimeter right?
either in outside buildings or whatnot
yeah you can do that.
but i want all farming and agriculture to be outside
in the lava
and replanted them
i took the stems
can i break these melons?
his last cube was out of contorl
idk
i think church service should be mandatory
and contorl the church
and ronald can mine
and you can build or whatever?
can i be in charge of agricultural and food management?
you mean his ugly cube?
i made a few jungle wood planks for you
eh the ammount we have is more than enough
nice
lol
also did you cheat to get the cocoa just so we could have cookies?
ill destory it
that will be destroyed anyway
like making ugly farms
fish is the best early ingame food source
fish
why
make a sign
ive made huge chicken farms with no seeds
you could just trap two chickens somewhere
you aren't actually in any rush
why?
gotta be slow and deliberate
i think you just arent patient enough
ill let you know
ill let you know when i run into a challenge
because it hurts too look at
well we can make a real farm and then destory it
ew
rather than getting a bucket and doing the right way
you just sloppy put down some water and tilled the ground
is that you didnt even plot out the farm
but what im saying
but a fountain is cool
no
you made a fountain before you made a non garbage farm
especially early on
there is no challenge
lol
ugly
fishing still
also fishing
they will just respawn
it means that they can't be exhausted
but there is a pig spawner
the pig spawner
except for you know
???
all the land isnt even tilled
still ugly
that's just laziness not resource management
why wouldn't you just get iron?
its ugly and in bad location
the dirt staircases
the hut
the farm
the bridge
the cube
yeah but everything build is ugly
also we don't have a limited ammount of wood
i don't expect an ugly cube of wood
harder to do what?
well it looks like shit
and yelling at them
there was this russian kid watching dota videos
lunch today was hilarious
fuck
oh shit i forgot
ty
is xmx the ram?
like asher hasnt beaten nier
and every one of you guys has a major game you havent beaten
but i get back friday
üò¶
also it's already ugly
üò¶
i missed all that first build day fun
:/
you still could have waited
that's what i meant
but i thought you were going to let me confirm spawn...
why the fuck did you already build?
yo @everyone
You are stealing my detective flair.
Dammit mac
I see discord on your computer
Honestly
Nice
Ronald is probably writing a code that every hour there is a 1% chance of him getting a stack of diamond
I know it
I don't suspect it
Is the only person who can't be caught cheating
The one person most likely to cheat
lol I have such problem with this
Configure the instance
Asher stahp
^
Should it increase exponentially or incrementally?
Yes please
That'd be dumb
Not hardcore
If you only lose your items at night.
That actually would be funny
Lol
How about every hour there's a 5 percent chance the server will change into hardcore mode for one hour.
How about no
Lol
150x150 that's about 100 chunks right?
Torches will mean more if you only have 100 chunks
Giving us shit to make depleting resources go faster would defeat the point.
The point of the map is to use up everything.
Why?
Yeah because there is an actual limited ammount
I think that's only fair
But no cheats
Yeh
I do like the idea that if something is so awful because we have limited space we'd actually have to go through the trouble of removing it
I'll just have to go underground.
And I'll be trapped with it
I'm so worried y'all are going to build something and it'll be ugly
^
What's the ip?
Sorry ronald I missed that
150 could be good for now and if we want to increase we can
Thanks bud we got tbat
Like in the middle I don't think you should be able to see the border
It's got to be enough chunks to be comfortable.
That's.
good question mac
Anything flat is fucking boring.
And good mountains
Look for bears
Yes
üëçüèæ
I can probably get on the server here but I wouldn't be able to really play
K but let me get on first mac before we set spawn
Which don't overlap but I will try to make it close
I need to find something that has Bears and parrots
Lol
I can't play until I get back though.
I agree
Confirmed
Lol it'll take ten minutes max
Parrots are what I'm all about
Yeah I gotta play 1.12 ronald
thats enough to give me an american-dream hard-on
with a decent living and good looking kids
They both seem to like eachother and are very attractive people
i know this is uncomfortable, but have you ever thought about how sexually satisfied your parents must be?
i also approve
no
now
new
megan has blue highlights
lol
you would go for the sjws
even megan is pretty far in
I'm gonna be the last one:(
i've never played it
holy fuck
you should casually ask for just a thousand
how many did he give you
shit
my hero
you are amazing
lol didn't even capitalize the i
AvocadoAtronach
idk
And I said it was because they had more interesting plot.

My grandmother asked me today why I only draw women.
why didn't you screenshot?
hey ronald?
thank you
can you though mac?
also mac cna you send megan the ftb map sometime
we should have another
^
yeah probably
it is 30 minutes
i want you to at least play the first chapter when i get back
mac
the little puns remind me so much of botw
except its capcom
it is classic nintendo humor
it is just your sense of humor
PHOENIX WRIGHT IS SO GOOD
MAC
^
being able to appreciate "reality"
well aren't you cool asher
It makes me want to play minecraft
The view out my window
and often times you should just tip out of curtosy anyway as a reflection of whether or not you enjoyed their service
anyone who does anything for you outside of a standard fee you tip
that's because you also have never heard of tipping before
you always still tip
not supposed to because of the agreement with airbnb
I love how we are sheer opposites of how we treat service workers
I love you
lol
(no mac, I'm not)
do you tip?
ronald answer with integrity
this i gotta know
do you tip bnb's ronald?
and roub their ass on your pillow sheets
meanwhile they go around and piss on your floors
lol
boy have times changed
and nikil
ron
keena
new york was ewan
loch ness
^
it's like half the size of bedford
it's like the size of bloomington
nah washington?
how big could the whole state be
he lives in washington
when you guys go to seattle you need to find bigfoot
*shh* mac

*enhance*


oh wait hold up

loch ness monster confirm though
also that's not the cougar
tommy dedek invited me to his birthday

And.
Ow I'm going to find the Loch Ness monster
But basically I've spent the last 12 hours with way more confidence than I deserve.
And she asked me what I was laughing about and I said "memes"
That was a really good joke that made me laugh in front of my grandmother.
Rent is crazy cheap
I'm so moving here
But that could have been because she was Scottish.
She definitely was not better at sex
Our hostess was definitely in her early 30s
Also asher I have officially checked the box of sleeping with an "older" woman



I'm very not chill like stalking this woman because her face is super interesting
my body is broken
lol holy fuck
was he high?
(or maybe get my kidney stolen)
*except maybe kisses*
whatever that is supposed to mean
we were flirting this afternoon and she told me i could "swing by her room if i got bored tonight"
85% sure i'm going to make out with the hostess at our guest house tonight
also
probably good idea
just wondering
im not judging
gotcha
#420blazeit ?
so are you turning into a weed boy now?
yeah i just never got around to it
oh ive wanted to play that so bad
didn't have the same effect
i played that at the store
yeah
abzu would be so nice to lay high
lol
shit i couldn't have planned that better
is it actually>?
i got him to sign all star superman for me
that is frank quitely

For new donk
I need to make a fake passport
Lol
Yeah
He was born to write it.
Also all the writers games are complete flops except for the Phoenix series
Phoenix wright may be the most buckwild mainstream game I've ever played.
Mac
"oh im too lazy to close the app, becuas emy computer can run more than one thing at a time"
classic sign of processing privledge
i appreciate how you guys always have skyrim and dolphin open
also can i just say
kubrick faking the moon landing
it would make for such a good movie on its own
because on the surface level its so well thought out
i love the moon landing stuff though
lol
lol
like they just KNOW this shit
its also cool how no one in that documentary thinks their views are subjective
my favorite part is the minotaur
I made ronald watch that
sort of boring after a while
that was a cool thing to watch

i honestly treat it like a dating sim where the win condition is real life sex
bascially tinder is a very elaborate rpg
yeh
which i don't have
everything except like and dislike are dlc though
repeat means i go back to the previous person
ah the middle one means i boost myself
repeat, dislike, idk, like, super like
Theatre kid
100% can confirm
*cums in pants*

this is so good
Yeh
gotta get ff14
see guys
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0pH4RCCMdM
It gets you a personal handjob by gaben
Ie dota and mario
Like it works for all of us because we have so much in common in the discord
That's why it surprises me that you have friends with people who you don't have an immediate through line with
Now that Megan is obsessed with star dew I feel less obligation to keep a server going.
I would have
Like what kind of secret lives are you all living.
I feel like I can't trust any of you guys anymore now
Gift code to sims 3
So I'm curious as to how to manage those relationships with others
But we see eachother infrequently
Like I consider us very good friends mac
I think why it throws me off is time
Duh
We love you mac.
It's just surprising.
Macgate 2017
This is fucking watergate
^
^
Ah
Just casul conversation
Like just joking around talk?
Sweet dreams my prince.
Mac this isn't over
H and M girls are my white whale
Fuck!
We cover a broad subject range from tiddie to toe
Because I legit can't think of anything.
You do
Mac
Yes actually
Like?
What do you talk about?
But when you hang
Right
Is that what you talk about
School?
Ik you go to college
Also.
I need to start torrie hating

When you are with them?
What do you even talk about
Having friends.
I feel like you are cheating on me
Because now I'm jealous
Who???
Let's parse this out though mac
Or both
Or get way too competitive.
Until I start crying
Like I'm not joking
Do you have friends that aren't us?
Mac
"All your friends"
Wait
Wait
Wait
Help
Yeah.
That definitely doesn't he'll.
If I went clubbing in Japan and stuck to my morals anyone can
You're good though.
All Jewish people do
Especially if you have a jew fetish
lol that sounds so fucking dope
I can't wait until I make you play Phoenix wright btw
Life is just beginning.
It's 6:30 for me
We can't all be try hards like Keenan

This is what all the Scottish men look like btw
I feel that
I'll introduce you sometime.
She's pretty cool
Lol

She's lanky but has a perfect butt

I actually have the perfect woman for you
Oof
Anything red needs to be kept long and free
Ack nah
My red headed deer goddess
There is a girl exactly like her who was in my cancer class that I had a one night stand
Lol
^ she's boring enough to listen about r crumb

Which actually is just misogynistic furry art
Who are just really into fritz the cat
I'm just usually more into his very misogynistic fetish art
Yeah it's p good
*also I save r crumb for the third date*
Everyone here knows their shit about comics
Yo
Also guys here aren't that tall
And by the time they hang out with me it's too late to really be picky about it
No one can tell my height on tinder
Eeeeeh
Their men on tinder are so ugly
These poor Scottish women though.
You are the perfect catfish model
lol I've thought about that actually
The best thing about my grandmother going to bed at 9 and waking up at 9 is that I could actually get away with some of these women.
^
A red headed woman with the body of an angel and the voice of an ogre
And that's what I need
They'll sound like shrek
Then I just cum in my pants immediately
Because then my overwhelming personality does all the work
That's the best

These two I'm messaging

lol I thought that one was cute
I gotta move here



Sorry mac
The way the world should be
The red head to not red head ratio is beyond perfect
It's be worth it for some of these ladies
Because I'm foreign
I've got 55 matches
Just a cornucopia of cute redheads.
Also the Glasgow tinder is like a dream come true
Because miyamoto is a good guy
But a lot of the shortcuts were made very obvious as a means of overcoming that
Yeah I mean that's how nes era stifff artificially increased gameplay
You're probably good
So as long as you die every five levels or less
You can get 1 per every four or so levels
Especially if you are playing every level
But iups come pretty easy
Nah you can't
Lol
Yeah that's the gimmick
And the last 6 are the only ones worth anything as far as challenge gors
I mean it does only have 32 levels
Lol yeah maybe
Now you never have to play it again.
I'm so proud of you son
Good job bud
You did it!
No
I just realized it's not that crazy late for you guys
I'm just happy it's okay to be into Garfield in 2017

You just said you found a child attractive
So basically
Yeah ronald
I'm just so glad Garfield is making an ironic comebakc


@everyone i cant
fuck yeah
there is a frank quietly exhibit at the museum i am at



Just looked up the stairwell and almost had a heart attack
and i can't think of what he looks like without a beard
I've known ben since he was like 8
do you know what's funy
i can't really see it
lik ben briles?
yeah there is a really scary scene that wasn't in the video
we had to watch a gaspar noe film in that class
lol
and imagine being high
start it at 3:30 though
it's not boring it is just not a narrative
and it made me want to die
we had to watch the whole thing in class
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2s0piWs1CU
it's called l'ange
^
let me find out
so it looks a lot like the scene from the convience store
and the frames are aranged to correspond to the pitches of the static
but there is static playing in the background
because there is this scene that would just be smoke coming from a cigarette
I also think lynch was inspired by a scene from that movie
dude the flash finale was bonkers
that is just the fucked up part of that epsidoe stretched out
there is an entire two hour long movie i had to watch in a class
also asher if you ever want to fuck yourself up
dude twin peaks is amazing
lol
lol
I'm sorry dude
i
oh no:(
im really envious
it also seems so visceral
i wish i felt shit as powerfully as you in regards to weird shit
i wish i had your tolerance
i mean this
asher
good idea
oh
it is my calibrater
everytime i get new headphones i listen to stankonia
or watching sex scenes on my tv without having to turn the volume down
whcih was just playing ps4 without my ears hurting
they are really nice headphones for what i wanted them for
if i wrapped electrical tape over the vents it would be quiet and sound a little better
i rarely use headphones outside of my room anyway
im just going to use them in my room
so i can never use them around peope
i can hear these headphones clearly from across the room
also asher
lol
compared to my other ones
well what i mean is that the music doesn't sound as "surround" on these new ones
so ill probably use them more
but these are way more comfy
I feel like my other headphones are a little better
you got it bud
a little loose but nice
they are nice
the headphones came in
<@!125452744440938497> i forgot to tell you
i got excited because i thought we were talking about comics
if you want ink thats an extra 10
but it only has the graphite setting
that like something ron would write
basically no lag
not no lag
"basically no lag"
Real problems‚Ä¶answered.
You could write with basically no lag, if your computer was the new iPad Pro.
actual tagline for the apple pencil
Lol
They're back bitches!
So it would be difficult to fix that without redoing them from the original
Right but a lot of these games were scaled down in the pal version
Imagine Japan to na censorship but greater
The censorship is just taking out blood and historical references
Also I'm sure they fixed this but early pal games have huge lag problems
Not gameplay
The big change is censorship
The pal games are slightly different yeag
Lol
And we know what a starfox fan I am
Except starfox
Yup
lol I'll come with you to the midnight premiere but I don't really have any interest in it
I have dkc 2
üëçüèæ
Good thing you live in 2017
Considering most high ups at companies go on like random month long vacations
I'm sure you'll have more agency though as time goes on
Until you retire at 35
Are you going to find yourself?
The whole summer?
5.5 housing is just two hotel rooms
But ronald and I are still undecided.
Yeah that's pretty much the idea
Should travel with me
<@!127535721857679362> do you know what you are doing next summer?
Who was the only competent person there
But our manager left
I do
I've been applying for jobs
I have no clue
lol I hope so
Because he needs benefits
At a bank
He got a better job
üòÜ
üòö
love y'all
im going to actually go to bed now
going to museums and bars
18
looking for the loch ness monster
i doubt ill beat even one of htem
im bringing fates smt and two final fantasys
ill just stick with fates for now
thursday
but then doctor who
i was going to go to bed like 2 hours ago
i wake up at 9
idk
i only use microsoft edge
that sometimes too
i pla that at work
we could make a company in a week
lol
probably making hte game
or you making a game that gets any attention
be getting 1000 followers
lol we should have a competition and see whats easier
i have 69 followers on twitter
media
nice
its really nice when you think you recognize an obscure background actor
nice
nice
this is nie
ive never seen amazon xray before
holyshit
it invented buck wild
I fucking love doctor who
^
at a different time
in a different city
at a different hotel
make it easier for everyone
i will just buy my own room
no thats pretty standard
what?
so im going to need my own room
i just sort of want to try to pick up chicks in seattle
yeah but they will charge a lil more usually
or make you pay 50% more per person over
most rooms have a limit
its not
no
only if i get to sleep on the bed
ill decide no earlier than thursday
yeh
i could totally pull off a david tenent look
you can never be worse than me
i spent the whole day today watching glee
don't worry
üõ†
üëçüèø
like a tool
he looks like such a tool now
mac is your mom single
GUESS WHO ISN'T LEAVING THE HOUSE
AMAZON PRIME HAS DOCTOR WHO
OH FUCK
but anyway back to what's importnat
right right right cool
ill sleep on the floor
ill go only if you promise i can stay in a room with your mom and her friend
we could just live in the abandoned house two hours north of seattle my family is trying to sell
itll work out
see
and stay until pax
why done we just go to ti
seattle
that sounds like a nightmare for me
lol
leave sunday morning
you take a morning flight on friday
or i guess thrusday classes
unles you stay for monday?
on a friday?
you mean one class?
september
and use it to got to pax instead
what if i just decided to not spend this money
one day
beyond just maybe checking it out
i just have not interest in any day
lol
he said maybe wednesday to sunday
for the experience
and you can give me like 20 to go whatever day you want
ronald ill buy the ticket
lol
no dota is also an option for me as well
well im okay with whatever
ah
is it sold out?
are they sold out?
sure.
I can also just by my own tickects
ew
so ti starts on a monday?
all 12 of them
or maybe just try to hook up with all those dota women
not everyday but somedays
maybe i could just try to fuck around while you guys do ti stuff
probably the week to make it worth it
idc
idk
whichever
no way she'd say no
cool ill ask my grandma about it during our trip
her final week was pretty brutal
yeah it was pretty sad
^live
they only like 2-4 years
she was 3
3
old age
and i can just show ronald all my favorite shit
so ill come to seattle
and now my chameleon is dead so i have nothing to live for
nah i don't give a shit about work anymore
i come
i ronald comes
well then a week probably
whichever comes first
or until i find the loch ness monster
just a week
Scotland
unless you wanted a mic and camera set up
true but if you just got a capture kit you could still play from your bed
you couldnt play in bed
id watch it
that'd look amazing
lol
you can also just buy preprogrammed 3ds's
or do it yourself
and send it in to get modded
just buy a burner 3ds or 2ds
there is pretty much only one way
what do you mean "figure" out?
or maybe we can just make a game
i guess i need to focus on a pc first then
üò¶
audience of one
just for you
and stream my ps2
if you pitch in i can get a box
those were the days
we should hang before i leave
hi mac
It was pretty cool
Holy fuck
I don't like when rpg allow you to experience ever narrative thread.
Makes you more selective.
I think that's better
Duh
They probably use the same pricing service
Amazon probably changed the price.
From 150 to 50?
^
I'm also bored
Sure dude
I'm out of whisky
Oh no
üëçüèæüíÉüèΩüï∫üèºüëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüëØ
Lol thanks dude.
I'm just draw some pretty ladies to distract me
I just needed my teen quota
Nah I'm done
D all of the above
All
And now I'm depressed
I've been watch glee since 10
Lol
I dont
Hannah does
What about for my asmr?
Get good
I bought them on my phone
üëçüèæ
Please

2nd to last
It's me kissing him
Mac already gave you his picture
I thought it was midnight.
Whoa
Makes sense
It's just flashes a white image on the screen at max brightness
Innovation
Lol

The iPhone has front flash
I am

Or you know...flash



That better?
Or face shaming
I feel like you are body shaming me right now
??
Why?

üëçüèæ

^






ITS ART YOU UNCULTURED SWINE
Stay determined bud
oof
WHATS THE POINT
Lol
Hmm.
That was always my guess
Is he just into weird kink shit?
üò¶
Does he have a 14 inch dingus?
If just muscle
Like like 6' 4" 215 pounds
Macs just messing with you
Lol
And really buff
He's hot now ronald
^
And can't sleep
I'm dancing in my basement to shakira
Interesting
Are all the boys sleeping in one room?
Is lina there?
Cool
...
You
Are
...where
My list of male friends I've slept with versus actual men I have slept with is surprisingly incompatible
Let's shut down that heteronormative bullshit right here buddy
If ronald was a male I would
But we still have Skype sex so it doesn't really count
The only person I don't sleep with on a regular basis is ronald
Nah
I don't have a single one
But not being flirtatious
Not about not hating men
I've gotten bwtter
Lol yeah I wish that was a thing I did at iu
Yeah I've been hanging a lot with Megan which has been nice but I really want to sort of meet people
Lol
lol I need to meet people
Lol
Since Milton is god
Except way worse
Sounds like milton
Love it
Lol
And nier
Smta was v good
Lol
Ever heard of it?
Name of the rose I think or something
I still have to read this one book
No
Once my copy gets in from Amazon you have to check it out.
Yeah.
Philips mom lent me an anthology of Norse myth and it changed my life
All of shadow of mordor is about revenge which isn't very Tolkien
Yeah he likes the lore.
You probably like the themes
So idk
But then again sam really likes it and he's the biggest lotr fan I know
It ruins a lot
Good call
üò¶
It's pretty fun and mind numbing
^
It's the exact same as batman
And way less hrd
This is way less stealth
And there are slight stealth mechanics
With dope combos
Killing monsters
Like you just go around and play as batman with a sword
And by not very I mean not at all
It's not very lotr heavy
Neither am i
More of like what if the nazis won with alien and demon tech
Sort of
Yeah v similar mehanics
With robits
But it's nazis
For sure
It's got similarities in layout
Lol
Except I guess doom but I wasn't a fan because I don't like throwing up
It's like the best non core Bethesda game
I think ronald would enjoy new order a lot
That way you know it's real
That's why I used an emoji
üòû
I actually feel bad now.
That was earnest for our game talk
Whoa.
I love you mac
Lol
So just new order
Only new order
Wolfenstien 100% was not
I'm watching glee
Did people actually use MySpace in 2009?
Also only new order is Bethesda I'm pretty sure
Wolfenstien is far from core
Ronald like core bethesda
But it's also not bethesda
I agree
Although I do have over 100 games to keep me occupied in the meantime.
I wish I had a pc
So you'll have to call and ask your parents
They are probably rated m
It's a lot of killing in both games

Just fixing a nes


Best investment ever
It's the Seinfeld of games.
Nothing
It is stardew valley with no farming
They are all your favorite games
And I didn't say I'd try very hard before I'd give up
Also mac most of the grunt work is going to be writing
I haven't either!
or you know...just help us write it
we start selling it today
earliest access
or as i'm calling it a social puzzler
social sim
a good game
i want dead by daylight to be good
you got me there
lol and definitely not a comic that keenan has read
majora
its actually modeled after your favorite game of all time
itll be minimal coding but yeah that'll be necessary
i already know i'm going to end up trying to do all the work and giving up in frustration
lol okie dokie
....
gotta get in
<@!125452744440938497> mac and i are making a game
ge digital is still a real company also ronald
but it fits so well around the chest
really?
ronald i love how your shirt fits you better than the ceo
Makin' our future bright.

That sounds cute
lol
i am
k
Yeh
Weeding.
Through a sea of teens
Yeah we've all been there
Nice
I didn't open it though.
Oh.
Nice.
We got those in at gw
lol I'm playing shadow of mordor and completely forgot it was a lotr game
Lol
We also have the bowser amiibo.
It I wish it wasn't so boring looking
Yeah
I want to get one but I don't have splatoon
We have splatoon amiibos at gw
Because it would have just been a ten dollar kk
I saw that same set at toys r us for 10 dollars and it wasn't worth it for that amount
Yup
Good find
Yeah can't imagine it had a huge demand
The animal crossing ones are nice and always cheap
Nice was there a sale?
This is destroying my mind
This hurts me
My favorite cool games inc episode is a stealth game where you play as Reggie trying to buy a vita from bestbuy without anyone recognizing you
PlayStation pets was a fucking gem
Yo
I lol this fight is buckwild.
I'm watching people doing no damage runs of this fight to inspire me
So gotta go learn those
It's one of those fights where you actually need to block everyone of his attacks
Use all the buffalo
And even magic
I do
Expected level is 50.
I'm 59
I just suck
Nope I know what needs to happrn
I've never spent longer than a day on a dark souls boss
Yeh
This is the most time I've ever spent on a boss fight
Day 3 of the Roxas boss fight
As in a bunch of people do it but it's so exciting the first time you do
I just know that game format is a lot like solving a Rubic cube
Oh okay then idk
But is three any different in the puzzle?
He just must be very happy
There's no way that's the first win
Yeah people beat that all the time.
Isn't it just the 2048 game?
How is it the first time?
Lol
?
Love it

Lol
lol let's do it
"Strategy"
Lol
Classic rpg
Why don't you change them?
It's orange
Ik
Yeah?
Not everyone can have cargo shorts like us mac
I don't see your problem.
Boat
Other than Megan who just wanders around in a boay
Yeah I'm the only person who's actually been on it
Like two hours ago
I literally told you that asher
Glad we could have that talk.
Shovel Knight
Sounds good
Lol
And it continues

I actually don't either mac
It has a lot more subtle acting moments than normal which I really liked.
Eh I really liked it but it definitely wasn't a lot of crazy shit
Honestly me too.
I've been up since 5:30.
Did you watch the previous one
Awesome.
You home?!
You commin'?!
They do all the time
I found him in my filter
Asher
Say hello to trash baby

https://youtu.be/ra7xjfJaMyU
I leave and rejoin the server but I never restart my client because that takes forever
Ether hope it goes away or stop playing
Does the same thing in single player so it's not the server
After like an hour or so it'll just freeze every 30 seconds
Pretty not so great
It's over.
Time for new map
Yeh
the flamme still burns

\
ph
on a pc i literally had to hook up and install minecraft on
ronald im going to laugh if i get the server running before you
^
very cinematic
its got a lot of similarities
yeah
lol
nah i use a condom
and only two of them are porn
i use three websites
^
or did it just come with ten
did you install it for me?
send us a screenshot
asher
or i guess i dont now since everything got deleted nvm
but i never use it
i have another antivirus thing
hopefully
so i guess when things stop updating itll calm down
i guess the two biggest function is wondows modules installer and my antivirus
its just nvidia capture, steam and windows defender
k
will the cpu usage go down though after time when all these background processes are done?
almost ready to use my ult
lol
75% cpu now
love u
k
wut?
lol
what even are computers
now its at zero
wtf even is there
antimalware is using 59%
[10:09 PM] Dankey Kang?: hey is there any reason why my cpu is using 50% with nothing running?
also bump for my previous post
that is a good sign
thats normal ronald
hey is there any reason why my cpu is using 50% with nothing running?
i use my pc as an actual computer like twice a year
thanks ronald
lol
ty
what is the pc equiv of activity monitor?
www.downloadmoreram.biz
lol
i'm gonna try to get it going on my pc then
thanks ronald
lol
cool
8 gigs
thanks

Yeh
How I check my ram please
?

How do I view the ram on my pc?
I honestly had to restart it a couple of time ronald and the after that it started up pretty quick everyone.
Time to hack
Lol ronald tries too hard to launch it but gives up easily
How did I manage to get it then ronald?
üëåüèæ
Probably not
Lol
Lol
Or you could just keep it open like you do with literally every application you have.
Lol k
üëçüèæ
Mac what are you working on?
Since you aren't in game
Once the client is loaded though ronald you can minimize it and it isn't very demanding
My laptop is unusable when I have it running
Lol yeah
2015
Idk what year t is though.
Mine is 4 I checked this morning
And I honestly don't think I'll be able to run it
I already know my air is 4
K
Mac do you know if my pc is 8gb or 4?
...
This is unplayable.
Okay maybe I need to restart my computer
The inventory screen is the best feature it tells you how to craft everything
They aren't useful though.
Lol you can spawn them back it
I am so frozen
I only have 4 ram and this is definitely some heavy duty stuff
It's probably me
Mmm
Like it's actually unplayable now
As opposed to the last hour where it was okay
Also mac is there any reason why I would be getting unplayable lag now?
Yes
It's loading literally 10 different games at once and trying to mash them together
It'll take about 5-10 minutes
Eveytime
Just literally hit play
I'm bad with computers
I don't know how he is good with computers
Lol
Yeah which is what I'm doing though ronald because it literally won't run unless I use all my ram
I made Megan's 6
Lol
In the news menu
Yeah just select ftb beyond and hit play
Because the FTb profile you are on is already 10.2
Then you just just be able to hit play
Did you launch through twitch?
Also I already have like 20 different vegetables
When you break it you get all your items back
So turns out that tombstone thing is really useful
Or do it in the presences for the profile in the launcher.
You can either do that in twotch
And it crashed...:-(
There are 189 mods ronald
The heaviest.
Lol
Wtf is this even
I need some orange dye to make a chisel
And even then
It is basically unrecognizable except for the actual overworld
Cool then you can just launch it from the twitch
Holy shit you can infuse wood with blood
Yeh
I'm playing on Mac rn
Are you playing on Mac?
Yeah
Yeah beyond is the first one
Install
Click it
?
See the creeper icon
Lol yeah
And didn't know it
You were probably streaming kiddie porn
Twitch is preferable.
Yeah or twitch
K see the creeper icon?
It'll install it for you
K that's okay
He doesn't but I'm just wondering
Also do you already have minecraft installed?
Yes
^
But trust me
I think twitch bought curse and turned it into a sort of minecraft client.
I have no idea
Honestly ronald
Seriously
Step 1: install twitch
Ronald I can do it
Good ol stone and picks
I think I'm just going to make my first thing in vanilla and then v slowly experiment
Yeah
There are worms
Wtf
I'm on page 5 of 191 and I'm already overwhelmed
This is a lot
It is a built in wiki
This mod is so nice
Omg
Lol
Shit.
I can make a grave yard
Nvm I thought it was permanent.
It's destroyable.
I don't like that
It just gives me the date and player who died here
Ew
A little tomb stone pops up where I've doed
Oh ew yuck
Thanks
Perfect
But I want it here because I'm going to build a nice little base
So it keeps spawning me above
lol i made the sown bellow ground
Yes please
Kill me again and I'll give you the exact coords of where I spawn
Yeah no it wasn't sending me there when you killed me
You did 232 66 866 right?
Yeah it needs to be changed though because they were wrong
Yeah
Let me double check coords
Yeah it didn't work hold on
Yeh
Try it again
Yeah
If you are going by x y z then yes
X z y
No
lol I would have killed us all
232 866 66
Actually let me double check that
233 868 102
I made a waypoint for spawn since I couldn't set it
Thanks
Lol yeh
Mac how do I make it survival?
But because you want to see us naked
I'm pretty sure you can just build an X-ray machine ronald
Cuckoo clocks
Fuck
Yup and waypoints which is nice
I thought about spawning in a bunch of diamond but then I reealized I didn't even know if diamond was valuable anymore
Usually I'd hide a bunch of shit around the map
I haven't spawned in one item
Although I'm v proud of myself mac
And Keenan can't have creative.
Stealing from villages is okay though.
Mainly to not bios ugly shit, ruin the environment or rape and pillage villages
In the spawn room
Yeah.
I'm making a rule list
Was probably me
Just crashed for a bit
Did you just do something with the server?
I sort of want to start off building underground so I don't ruin the wildlife
Map
This is a p nice ma
Oof my CPU load does not like this
Yes
Why
Lol
I'm talking about for me
Time for mc
!!!!
K
I don't know why it worked on my computer instantly and why it's such a problem on hers
Mac I honestly need help.
Can you call?
Thanks
CREATIVE
GIVE ME PERMISSION
Twitch KEEPS USING THE SAME FUCKING LAUNCHER
I timed out logging in
lol it's taking so long to log into this server
Okay I'm home again let's see if we can get this going
Ronald, give me your computer information and I will install it all for you
K
I uninstalled everything
I literally deleted everything and reinstalled it through the twitch
It didn't for her:-(
I know what the launcher is
I deleted all of her minecraft and reinstalled it, would it have automatically put the new launcher there or  do I need to get it separately
I redownloaded minecraft as a whole, is it a separate thing?
Hey Mac, I need help getting Megan's minecraft installed.
It's opening up the old launcher and giving an error message
Scouting time?
Core is just there way of politely telling us it's not mystery dungeon.
Core literally means same as the last one so not mystery dungeons
And unique rpg or innovative rpg
They would say traditional rpg if it was different or hardcore
Experience.
So it can't me a new rpg experiment.
Core literally means main franchise.
Either stars or gen 8
And also just be a good game
Yeah
Mario is literally giest
This is actually what I though prey was going to be
That is horrifying
Omg.

it's so bad you made ronald leave
im excited to hear this
lol omg
?
is the server up btw?
k
what should i get
mac i get a free ps2 or ps1 game
that's dope
i saw the thumbnail and thought it was a joke
oh but like actually?
lol
god i forget how actually pretty the elite controller is
adlfkjglakdfjg;lakfg
ugh i can't wait 2 hours
dark cloud and bgae are definitely series id like to have in my collection
its same price as steam though which is nice
id still prefer to have it physcially though but o well
the hd version is on psn
oh nvm
i just love rayman
which we had a copy of 2 weeks ago üò¶
at least not compared to our price for the ps2 version
its not
how uch?
ew
yeah im sad none of our stores have bgae
itll probably go up in price soon
and its 12 here
okay ill wait for monster hunter then
i want to get ni no kuni because it is harder to find
if i wait until switch will you promise to also get it?
or should i wait for switch
yeh
should i buy ni no kuni or generations?
mac
so hype
Even mac
Literally all of us are getting it asher
Kinda want?
Boobs
Good I need someone to explain this
Let's se
This is a little out of my league
Oof okay
You mean twitch?
How do I assign that?
It's stuck at the same place so I think I just need to be patient
It'll be worse truer me
Lol dude
This initialization is not going well
Lol
Lol
You should tweet at dunkey
....
No chat got it
Lol k
Can you hear me?
Mac
https://www.feed-the-beast.com/projects/ftb-beyond
Are you watching in twitch or the tube?
Mac
good schedule
lol
for that
we should chat
nice
half life 2 epsidoe 3?
super meat boy 2?
overwatch for switch
mario kart deluxe for pc?
with all the different ores and shit the combiation of these mods would generate though there is no way we can contrict the world
i just want mac to teach me how to set up a server
it seems dope
okay yeah we should definitly go with beyond
what is ender io?
i like aquaculture
ah
lite and beyond are the most updated nonskyblock ftb so they definitly will be best
but i could be wrong
just ic2
i didn't see buildcraft on either of them though
"appleskin
especially since beyond has applecore which will allow for us to add any hunger mods
infinity lite or beyond looks like the way to go
looks like ftb is for 1.10.2 which is my preferred version
yeah it is either forge where you just install and drag or ftb where you just install
but even i did it in ten minutes
youll need to install stuff ronald
are their any ftb for anything past 1.8 though?
lll find that one and check it out
k
k
but i looked it up and you should be able to run a ic and harvest server without tekkit
i have the hermit pack downloaded
kh be getting crazy
Minecraft
You know what'd be better though?
Nice
At 4 I was set on generating ocs
I never used existing ips though.
Nah my comics from my childhood are somewhere hidden
He's 37
My cousin made this for me



Keenan only wears slacks and tight t-shirts
I'll get different colors though.
I was worried they wouldn't fit
I'm gonna order some more because I really like these
I'm in ecstasy
I just got 4 identical pants in the mail
Attack box!!!
We should do it together so you can teach me how
It didn't seem like they did
that im running
so mac i made a functioning mod list
klei is trustworthy
perfect title
rebecca cordingley  is the next eric barone
]goty
hype
yeeeeeeeeeeeah
god i'm excited to make an underground powerplant
i followed him and ill chekc him out
cool
i'm on the industrial craft wiki right now excited by all the features ill get to ignore
you are also welcome to download the map ronald and see if you like it enough
so we will see
i mean i was playing on what hopefully becomes the map this morning
because there is a lot of agricultural stuff in industrial craft
i think the harvestcraft and industrial craft will really blend nicely
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B65b1mro-oj_V3pMakk1bFdQV00
it has a lot of dynamic stuff in a short range which will keep it interesting in the beginning
yeah okay im going to send you this map so you can see what you think
well just pretend the mods are an update and you are secretly playing on 1.15
it is really cool
i really think we should use this map i just spawned
we can't even use most of the 11 features
lol
so fuck off
also the last version you even played was 10.2
lol mods pretty much always need to use previous versions
havent tried 11 yet
harvest craft is working pretty well with industry craft though on 10.2
and it is a tiny ocean in the middle of nowhere with an ocean temple right below me
i just spawned a map
lol holy shit
because fuck you
k
i'm checking right now to see if harvest craft can run in tandem with ic
üñïüèø
lol k
we should chat and talk about serve
ew
cool
is ubisoft happening today or was that last night?
also when is the next conference?
like?
safe
10.2 seemed pretty sagfe
but idk
if you want to try to get it running on 11 i'm up for it
and forge is not functional for 12 yet
i'd love to have llamas from 11 but it just didn't run very good
i mean the only big things about 11 and 12 is the maps and the colors
lol
and that one ran the best
because i installed 3 different versions of industrial craft
so can we do 1.10.2?
its the only good one of that meme
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2KVGAE2Z0s
yeah
1.10.2?
?
<@!71716577669550080> can we make the server 10.2
that was fucking genius
Thanks
Lol
YEA!
i can't hear you
mac?
but phil is here
oh you mean chat
on youtube
i'm watching the ign stream
in what?
why are you watching on twitch?
ah
you watching the prestream?
I need to be drunk for this conference
K it's over.
E3 time
Lol
I can give you the account info
You have wifi?
This is the most fucked up episode yet
Holy shit asher
10:30
Twin peaks is still going.
Too bad
Expert in nothing
Jack of all trades
We've already addressed that
It's okay I was asleep for half of it
Lol
So we can hook you guys up with the same girl
Asher and I have already done the sex thing
Who is a third party that actually knows us all?
In think that's a really cool idea ronald
It's Miyazaki copying moebius and it's brilliant
yes
THANK YOU
Lol
And sex
What's the metric?
lol no ines going to play
^
And even sec with animals
I get perks with sex and animals
You should join
We are starting the server tonight.
Lol
How?
Lol omg
Mac was bored
Because everyone knows ronald is packing 13 inches
I'm glad we haven't seen each other's dicks
Asher we can only prove that by having sex with eachother
Lol
Yeah?
We just started it asher
Can you explain all the new memes to me
Mac
Sorry
Lol
They did last year
Maybe not
Either on nick or griffins yoitube I think
But it's not like an official pre game thing
They have just been live streaming all day
Kinect adventures.
I wonder how many of the people worked on the best rare game of all time
Lol well pirates are canonically not as good at eating bananas as a gorillas.
Then they disappear.
I mean clearly not.
In dk you just walk into them
Lol
It would take me a week to make this
They are born content creators
They do this so fast
Lol
ik thats the only reason id even consider it
i guess
maybe
k
lol
üëçüèø

my greatest creation

12 of them will be sports games
Most impressive thing they can manage at 4K rn
Honestly that's probably the safest demo of the x
Nice
Forza?
Next generation
Sleek design
Speak deaign
Innovation
It's name is even backwards compatible
Is it really called the Xbox one x?
Is that not a joke?
The most powerful console
It's all being processed through the scorpio
i just love the idea of a dynamic soundtrack for a ds game
lol
lol this is a ds game
Unlike in Final Fantasy XII, the music is entirely dynamic and context-dependent.
Each track possesses different parts, ranging from musical themes of peaceful moments to frantic battle cries, which are activated when the actions of the players require it and are looped until the context is changed again
like maps are designed so you capture areas and then they start spawning creeps that are weak but allow you to create diversions or get extra strength to capture all the points
a mixture between turn based combat and capture the flag
pretty cool concept actually
im summoning creeps
this is literally dota
holy shit
ideal
thatd be idea
so i can just play it with one hand
this ff game is really nice because it only uses the stylus
lol
did you get to the punchline?
puff puff means putting your face between boobs
skip to 2 minutes in
this is the highest quality i cuold find lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9sv6nvSwPc
üëå
just like fe
there is melee ranged and flying though
and you controlled max 4 characters
it actually is like that but if it was a different map every level
yup
its real time tactics though
i'm playing a pretty good ff tactics game
lol
or 12 i guess
first fifa game since 08
I may get it '
lol
so all these cool designs are going to waste
because legally these characters wont be able to be used agaon
it sucks though
no way
especially since they are promising an august 2018 laucnh
that game should not cost that mcuh
yeah it is just way too much money
so getting a taste of that is still good i guess
considering the music is the only part that matters
still better than nothing
it is just concept with a guy rapping over it
yeah but it isnt gameplay
they just released to preliminary footage for rap rabbit
btw
lol
oh
is that hollow knight?
lol


i hate this
also the yl jokes are actually pretty funny
and i can say xbox is the worst
i have held all of them many times
it is a pretty okay game
but even as is
i got a red one last week
also i have decided that yl is not a bad game
4 player and i just get the snes
lol
why do you need a dualshock and xbox?
why do you have it?
is the xbox one new?
if you just look through everything else
like even if you don't read the chat
i love how mcuh of a story can be told in our discord server
ha
eh
from dota to smoking weed
lol
i want more categories but i cant think of any
lol
which is basically a trivia major
and i am a history major
like i know about sports from my dad
yeah well and my interests i think are broader than ashers
savage
lol
üëå
lol final fantasy
drinking is so much better
because it isnt worth it
not that i'm saying that you should keep trying
and asher even longer
i took me a long while before i got my first high
same thing happened to asher and i
also ronald that is really common
you vaped weed?
....
i rarely masturbate to porn
nah because asher masturbates more than i do
lol
actually i know he does
asher probably enjoys sex more than i do
fair
i feel like ronald has definitely smoked more times but asher enjoys in more
<@!127535721857679362> care to weigh in?
asher only started like a week ago
really?
seriously though who smokes more asher or ronald?
mac it's illegal
why do you smoke the most weed?
Mac wtf
especially before i started working
because i also go to three or four places during the summer
so i feel like we travel the same amount mac, but i just have decycles to put me ahead
ü§î
^
i definitely win in lifetime
but i can make like actual dishes from scratch
you have me beat in grilling then im sure
i make like actual meals
i feel like i put more effort into cooking though
why is ronald first in cooking?
wait
ethan literally goes to elementary school with my sister
ronald still lives in bloomington
he didn't even visit you
and bloomington the day before that
and then cayman consistently
i go on like 5 major trips every year
so i think mac is secretly travelinging the world and not telling us
plus ive biked through most of the states in the country
i mean ive got japan and scotland coming up
you don't even know
he doesn't really go anywhere except to visit family
asher should be last
i was wondering that too
like jeopardy
no
so trivia
general trivia
lol
make charts
lol
that's not true
that's why you are last
lol
hes gone through like 500 hours work of mbmbam
thats what he does at work
i dont think you listen to more than asher
agree
and twiter
i only use pinterest
nah i rarely use tumblr
lol
ronald loves rotom
oh
reading
oh shit
since i stopped
i feel like we are all tied for last except ronald
also hatsune miku isnt anime
lol that i got him
how is asher higher in anime?
lol wtf mac
we need more categories
i seriously love this though
because i am the only one of us that actually owns phsycial pornography
and i am 500
you are zero he is -5
asher actively destroys porn
mac you just don't watch porn
yeah but you don't do anything about it
like he writes blog posts about how bad porn is
so he has to be last
asher actively hates porn
i fixed porn for you though mac
mac i actually know songs and musicians
i'd be last
or maybe asher idk
you are first for musician though probably
but as far as actual music knowledge goes i am by far second
we both played music for a long time and took music theory
so?
just because you know about vgm
although there is no way in fuck you are higher in music than me
i love this
lol this is amazing
k
don't scare him away
*shh*
speak of minecraft and he shall come
when can we play minecraft?
mac
lol
that's it
yup
there is a spot that definitely looks like it could fit the toad
i already see the perfect place for ity
okay ill do it when i get home, just remind me
lol
can't imagine it'd be that hard
maybe
lol actually
the good toad
i wonder if i can find anything in the button reflections
they look like they are made of wood
his shoes are weird though
i doubt it but maybe
and it was the most beautiful thing i had ever seen
i remember when the same thing was released for the brawl version of mario
or just the promotional model
do you think this is the actual model though?
i think they are the same character but put into robot bodies after a tragic accident
http://img13.deviantart.net/7fc4/i/2015/077/7/d/politank_z__tokugawa_choujuurou_and_hamusuke__by_kamiomutsu-d8m6s9k.jpg
the robo cop
yeah also arms took a character from it
we can play when i see you next
yeah
it has the craziest campaign ive ever seen in a fighter
but it is so good
because i thought it was a different game
its that neo geo one on the switch ive been ignoring
and it actually really really good
its a fighting game
but seriously though waku waku 7
yeah
and chat like i am rightnow
yeah
yeah ill be at work until 1
it is buckwild
you should get waku waku 7
nvm
ugh
it doesnt start at noon
we shouldhang for nintendo though
that wroks better anywa
no prob
yeah
when i checked this morning
thatws whay i thought
lol
what's that like
i heard you and hideo kojima were bffs
so miyamoto
miyamoto is always gold
i meant the interviewers
i wonder if the e3 miyamoto interviews are as bad as the c2e2 stan lee interviews
if i invited mario i would too
d you think that's his body guard?
especially if nintendo does anything smash related
that'll be interesting i really think they are going to drop the ball on that
i gues mvc
because injustice isnt real
do you think any non nintendo company is going to talk about a fighting game to compete with nitendo?
also i was talking about 8-4
lol well they start with the worst
E3 HYPE TRAIN!!!
youve got 8 hours
now
get it done
or nba jam
you can just play fire emblem during twin peaks
do you want to hang then?
good point
i did not think of that
hmm
its an hour and i cant just immeaditely kick philip out so i can start watching e3
so i will miss a bit of the bethesda
shit twin peaks is at 9
we should call for that
bethesda is at midnight right?
i work until 5
hype
yup
yeah but i made sure ill be home during all of nintendo
wonderful 101 on eshop
whoa what if man
and turn ice climbers into an actually good franchise
it could literally be a fusion between kid icarus and kirby
but i can't think about it
smt i am beyond hype for
hearing the 8-4 guys joke about a new ice climbers game made me realize how fucking brilliant a sakurai ice climbers game would be
over 50%?
i need objective numbers here mac
any incarnation of it
what is the percentage of any news about animal crossing
mac heres the real question
They inspire me
https://instagram.com/p/BVMZh-FHXW4/
i think at the least we will definitly get news about octopath
they may want to try to stack that and marvel
idk
lol
I mean that's literally the point of e3 thugh
lol why is octopath unlikely/
i think if we get anything earthbound related it would be mother 1+2 for 3ds and switch
lol it sucks nintendo legally can't use fan translations
17 years
so they will probably way 7 years
and mother 3 came out in 2006
well mother came out in 1989
like mother 3
this is just pretty much just them following up on everything they've shown at some point other than bonkers stuff you pulled out of your ass
like its v possible there will be an elder scrolls in november
lol what if they can't get skyrim out for switch before the new elder scrolls
its a little too early
i don't think they are going to have anyting about mario
geez mac
i'm here now
hi mac
PLEEEEEEASE DONT LEEEEAVE ME
When you go away, you won't hear me say
Lol fair
Not my Scotland trip
Lol Wii theme
!!!
I'm so sad.
I heard he had cancer but he's rich so I figured it'd be okay
Yeah
Adam West just died
Guys
Have fun btw man
üòÑ thanks
No:-(
Of course
Lol
Is the cars 3 game coming out before the movie?
Wait
this is litterally a dunkey video if you read this while showing footage form battlefield 1
lol
it did
i honestly cant tell the difference graphicalluy
lol
other than fe stuff i guess
I can't think fo a game not from the nes era they could remake that i haven't played
that's honestly the problem for me
i mean nintendo could remake any game older than 5 years and itd be a genius idea
maybe
lol of course
you don't think they'd just port it to the eshop?
lol
hmmm
really??
really?
lol
which is already so close to being a parody
i think its funny that they are parodying polygon
yeah but itll grow
yeah but i feel like console owners don't really care about htat
yeah but also if you want to buy sonic adventure you actually fucking can
which is why xbox's service seems like itll also be superior in that way
its stupid
ik
most of playstation now stuff isn't on psn
no that's what im saying
if you have playstation now and only end up playing like 5 games you can't buy those games
on playstation you can't
yeah but you can
like i thought if you just wanted to pay money to actually purchase the game by itself you could on xbox
but i can't get
because that is the biggest downfall for playstation is there are a lot of games on their thing that id spend a lot of money for
at least for xbox
yeah also im p sure everything in that service is offered as a purchasable download
yeah
interesting
hmm because thats like the only way im able to sell xbox ones
how can they track that?
thats so not true my sweet baby boy
its really gearing itself towards people who don't like spending money on games but don't know that pcs exist
also i think the only thing xbox has for it is it's new service and its backwards compatiblitiy
i just want halo
^
eh idk actualy
because consumers are dumb
depends on how sony responds honestly
apparently the big suspicion is that they will talk mainly about scorpio specs, their new service and backwards compatiblity
and i need your live updates
ill be somehwere else but ill have my phone
yeah dude
pm est?
cool
or 10?
isnt that not until 3?
we only talk in the offical chat
lol when do we ever chat?
then i can finally change mine to helix
lol
yeah üò¶
i wish i had a cool birthdya like you
lucky you
those four letters are such good indicators as to why language is dead
gj ea
stay humble
or at least leave a good review
stop
lol mac
no Kaityln we don't
"do u have any mario?"
everyday
you should see the personal messages i have to deal with
yeah that was weird
welcome to me job mac
that one is one of my favorites
oh shit
ps4?
gangs all here
still not bad
its $120...
WANT
WANT
WANT
WANT
WANT
just to make fun of you
you brought ronald out of the void
actually i 100% will post the good toad
yeah i thought you were yelling at me
Last week was "PS4? üòû"
Literally every week
Is that why?
That's seems really specific man.
And every time I make an ad I always get a comment from a different person that says "no pa4 games?
This is why I don't shop here"
My favorite thing about my job though is that majority of our sales exclude PS4 games
Yeah which this guy doesn't want
We still don't give money back
Even if you have the receipt!
We don't even give you your full money back if you return a game you just beat
But mac

My job ladies and gentlemen
honestly this is porobalby going to be the best 3ds game of the year
these are amazing
gotta start banding myself
man i really gtta get my online personality going
zane was a little shit
alex, nathan and the other guy were good
that's not true
they were really good players
I can't believe that group is still around though
grimiore or whatever
he also voices asher's favorite boy
thats how i know him
hes also the only good character in naruto
yeh
because griffin writes the campaign
also there are a lot of good subtle video game references
i think after a few episodes it would make you want to play dnd
you should really listen to adventure zone sometime
that's what youtube is for though
which a lot of people are
unless you are huge into fantasy
and dnd in its purest form is very boring
yeah but honestly the biggest problem with cr is they are trying to play dnd
but it will never replace my love of the mcelroys
liam o'brian does a great job though
most good improv people are actually really bad actors
being good at acting is very different than being able to create story lines on the fly and setting stuff up for later payoff
they are good actors but only a couple of them are good at improv
just sort of boring
which there's nothing wrong with
because most of the stuff in cr is pretty generic
if you are going to make it enjoyable to watch/listen
thats why you want improv actors to do it
is the voices don't make dnd
but thats the problem
yeah
only dnd thing i like is taz
yeah i'm not really a fan
because i got bored
tuesday i wrote an entire dnd campaign
thats funny
because it is just a beta of botw
and 4 is honestly the best besides blood dragon
ive played blood dragon, primal, 3, adn 4
yeah i really like the far cry games
far cry 5 is the only time ive ever been interested in a far cry game
savage
you just don't understand art
it's art mac
no
lol
with lucio ball
thats what rlm will be
that just means the switch will be the frist to get Rocket League Max
do you think we will ever get rocket league for switch??
everything else is just sort of stuff that makes it a normal sports game
that's literally the only thing that makes this unplayble
thats awesoe
goty
!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!
also nothing in the animation
but there is nothing to visually indicate that timing
you can only get it if the timing is right
so when you take shots
a fucking visual timer
i honestly have only one change i want with this game
because it was a cross over of things we liked
my dad and i used to play it
as in makes no sense
the original is pretty fucking weird
but hes the campaign character
no
its more a punchem up
lol kinda
marvel v capcom style
2v2
thats racist mac
I just only know everything from one game
but ive never watched a basketball game
and my father and i could finally bond
what if i  learned a shit ton of basketball
lol
lol
fine on tv
yeah it is bascially unplayable in handheld
there is a lot more racial diversity in this
it has like the same res as snakepass though
who is the only bball boy
I just don't think michael jordan is in this
yeah
no
lol
i honestly love sports games
thats not like most sports games
whcih is actually really cool
you can only play with characters youve unlocked though
lol
they all look the same though
and i feel like im supposed to feel something from these names
like you unlock player cards
but i think would be higher if i knew who any of the baskeyball players i win are
this game is like a solid 6
k
and it makes me wish real basketball was like this
ive been playing nba for a while hnow
because they made it about real sports
i feel like they didn't understand the concept of esports
was bad
sony tried to get into esports
i just sort of meant with games
and valve season
sony season
I wish we had nintendo season
i honestly like that though
thats not true dawg
lol
and switch to different games
like had the desire for knowledge about a sport that doesnt get updated every three months
could you imagine if we were into real sports
lol mac
splatoon 2 will be first
yeah nintendo seems to have the right idea rn though
yeah
pokken
thats just basically this year
what else?
melee
splatoon
arms
puyo puyo
especially if they could market competitive speed running into esports
yeah seriously though
lol holy shit
Melee port confirmed
I want mr shifty but I'll get that on ps4
I should also get minecraft
Also I should get shantae and kamiko while I'm here
Yeah
i wanted nba playgrounds after the update anyway
i'm down
doooope
you sure ill get shaq fu?
ill buy it right now
ill do that
whoa
shaq
i liked shaw fu....
what the literal fuck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2ZN_akgTMg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG5KfJ503J0
Correct
limiting our exploration and forcing us to work with what we have
like less than a chunk a day
we could also get rid of the resources all together and just have it increase by x chunk amount over a long period of time
lol also i realized with these commands you could make a map that spawns us all at random corners of the map and is slowly shirinking
idk
or maybe another resource dik
maybe it like adds x chunks in radius for every x stack of emerald
or make a cap for an arbitrary threshold amount
then we would literally just be increasing the world size everytime we gave it resources
http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/World_border
why can't we just have a command block that manipulates this
actually
with concentric circles
and we could do it attack on titan style
https://mods.curse.com/bukkit-plugins/minecraft/worldborder
well this exists
let me check
that you could just set permissions to
i feel like there has to be border mods
idk
and theyve been making fighting games for 30 years
and they have never made a balanced fighting game ever
because it is netherealms
but apparently it is still broken as fuck
itd be okay if it was a really well put together fighting game
yeah
its on par when spider man gave mary jane ovarian cancer from his radioactive sperm
its close to the worst super hero story period
because the actual story is garbage
there is just one campaign as it should be
because a lot of what injustices campaign does that is smart is makes it so you don't have to beat the campaign as a different character
where it is a story mode designed for you to fight every character as everyone
probably because it is designed in the same way
which isnt a high bar but still
tbh injustice probably has the best campaign of a non smash fighting game
so it kept land we havent touched yet in good condition but also gives incentive to rape the current land
and then made it so the only way to get into the next grid was to pay a crazy amount of resources
what if we did it so we made a premade seed and blocked off areas
about my minecraft mod idea
so anyway
literally everyone knows
"you never know"
and jesus mac
i had an idea for a minecraft mod
love you
lol
it is
for your punchline
i love that you actually had to look that up
the rhythm portion of the games are a rip off of guitar hero
but im talking about the first one
both are amazing
ü§∑üèø
that's when i knew he had power
which made me question whether it was a good game
ill never forget his oot video
its like his super power
he can make any game look bad though
lol
why?
it is just garbage though
tbf injustice 2 probably deserves a 9
only games i know ill never play
I never read the reviews for games i want
lol ew
thats good for them
polygon 8/10
speaking of arms
how do you even
yet only 13 acheivements
currently in game
i saw that
art

lol
with spash effects
its just a random grandient block
but what even the fuck
lol thanks i get that
what is that design even?
your brother is my favorite
That south East Asian build was actually pretty cool
Lol
<@!71716577669550080>  dota?
I can bring it to work tomorrow if you want.
<@!125452744440938497> I have your jacket
gen 2
i got the only thing i wanted

"Yeah I'm sorry?
Do you mean acceleration?
Yeah dude we are all literally physicists in this room we know what the fuck acceleration is"
"You see flash this represents your speed increase over time as your run"
Some guy just spent a minute explaining the concept of acceleration to the flash with out ever once using the word acceleration
Lol holy shit
Camilla is life
Which is my least favorite part of fe
Unlikely though.
Considering how popular they are
They could be very bad writers in Japanese.
Or at least the people who translate them are genius
I judge her
I can't imagine being fluently literate in a language you never yse
And she literally never uses it
And is really ashamed to admit it
One of my professors just learned Japanese to read manga
God I wish Japanese was an easy language for children.
And that I didn't only want to learn it to make video games more accessible.
Yeah that's my job
And have my family in Japan translate shit
I just learn how to actually localize thinngs
After learning a lil more like localization it's funny how these fan ports have about as much work put into them as real ports the only difference is the legal shit
Yeah
Yeah
Fan games are cheap
It's 2017
No
Even though I could just buy one right now
Lol
That fans have made gba ports of
Nah they have pretty good translations
And mother 3
I gotta beat earthbound first.
Is golf story coming for switch?
Where they are captured and sent to an alien planet to play tennis
I want there to be a fucking space opera like Mario sports game.
Wario wario
Luigi mansion
Chibi
A mario sports game with a good campaign
Donkey kong
Animal crossing.
Bayonetta 3
Ww2 for switch
Call of duty
I would love to do a 8v match all ice climber final destination though.
Yet olimar is somehow okay
Switch can't handle it
They can't add iceclimbers
Brawl 2
I need wario
Wario warioo
Wario
So they can make directs without Reggie even knowing.
They probably have just a template they use
Lol
I just can't believe it's 24 hour notice
There are only two more primaries left but they will never use it
Only gen 1 is colors
Rebranding.
They are just starting over.
The sequel to Pokemon.
Pokemon 2
Pokemon ranger
Masuda is making it
Here's the twist.
Mystery dungeon
This is it
Hype
Oh shit
?
you are a fucking hero
<@!125452744440938497> you still there?!?
I'm making dinner now so I'm chill
<@!125452744440938497> when do you think you are coming over?
We are brothers again in that regard
Turns out the entire season just turns out to be Andy doing a let's play
Everyone knows that.
That's true gold shovels have the best durability
Why gold
What are those shovels for?
Yo but like.
Ita gonna be buck wild
Pineapple#3564 I'm so fucking pumped for tomorrow.
how do they fit everyone
sucks to be them
they did it at the gym?
lol
yeah i couldn't remember if you were related to your 700 brothers
I went to a bunch of graduation parties yesterday.
Lol yeah
I just had a great time with Megan and we didn't have sex.
I'm growing.
Yeah.
Very glad I had nothing to do with that whole.
Situation.
I can't understand being happy about it
I can understand being pregnant at 20
20:-/
I was off by only two months.
I had to do some quick math when I checked her Facebook page to make sure I wasn't in danger
Oof a girl I slept with last summer is pregnant.
I didn't know if you gave up after the franchise sold out.
<@!127535721857679362> have you played angry birds 2 yet?
He doesn't have to compete with a bunch of YouTubers or podcasters because he's not either.
So griffin definitely has his own niche
Also Forbes tries to pick a person in a different media sphere for each 30
It is pretty unique and well developed
I think it's more of just the whole griffin media brand in general.
I think the mbmbam is like 20% of that
All nick did was be super active on forums
And did a bunch of stuff before that
I mean griffin has been podcasting for a decade
6 years is significant socially yeah but to think that he really has all the skills we have and hasn't done that much with them is sort of encouraging.
It's weird to think that nick isn't that much older than us
Yeah it's not nice to call nick a pervert
No.
It's a bad toad.
Please sir we will look so fucking cool
The social media manager at Nintendo is probably begging their boss to retweet it
Let's take a look at the mouth.
But since they've already been established they can do more in the return.
Keeps it cliche and soap operatic that way they can explore those themes.
Yeah.
I do appreciate it though because it definitely grounds the story
Yeah it's good shit.
That's about it
Hawk is just looking for something.
Yeah honestly other than cooper returning to normal there is nothing really driving the story right now
Yeah
Mother of bob.
Which I think is how it'll be handled.
I sort of want it only hinted at
I'm scared it'll be disappointing though.
Yeah
Yeah it's a good amalgam
Also I'm excited to learn more about dougey
Especially from television
Which I never get anymore
Yeah I genuinely feel anxious anytime real cooper is on screen
Like even the immediate payoff with the box was pretty good
Unlike original tp
And they definitely did that in the return but since it is a single cohesive unit I think everything is going to get the screen time it deserves
Is that in a lot of shows the first 4 episodes just create all these narrative lines that the writers have the option to go back to and explore if they want ti
Yeah.
Here's what I like about the return
The original first season?
lol
Fucking crazy
18 episodes right?
Also I'm so pumped for sunday
Yeah.
They definitely put the best clips on YouTube imo
P fun
And marathoned all the episodes.
Asher I got the 7 day free trial to seeso
Get a switch
Thebowseramiiboblendsbothtoyandgamealike.youmayknowthispointydadfromgamessuchassupernintendopunchbrothersandnintendofuntimedriving.
<@!71716577669550080> we just got a bowser amiibo in.
I'll give you $20 if you put it in your mouth.
Thank for the cloud saving for Sony is such a good service.
I have over 25 no disc games and have to install them anytime I want to play them or delete them when I'm done.
It's bogus
68 gigs!
3 hour updates!
I wish games today bragged about how large they were.
But I mean.
It is 16 hardcore megs
It's streets of rage 2
Heavy duty
Holy shit guys
It's a condition.
The cold feet asher
Cuz I know what's up
That's why if I ever date someone way taller than me the first present I'm getting them is some wool socks
And it's perfect.
But if they are too big then their legs get cold and you just get to nestle all up in there
See.
If they are too tiny then your legs just get cold when you're alone.
Yeah.
I'm in a nice mid zone.
See I get that but then there's a place for me where if they are either significantly shorter or taller it opens up a whole new realm of possibilities
They were too wide
Lol.
My lips barely fit in her mouth.
Which I guess is actually pretty small.
She was like 5' 2"
She wasn't that small she just had a small head
But yeah last night a made out with this nice lady and I thought I was going to swallow her face.
I like tall women.
I'd be v self conscious if someone was 6 ft plus going on a date but I'd be super into dating them.
Is that a joke?
I felt like a monster.
I just made out with someone with the tiniest mouth.
What strip?
Mr.
Barbera would be proud.
Isn't that fun kids?
Fun fact: in the 2016 flintstones comic Fred and Barnie knowingly aided in genocide!
So I don't see why not.
The current flintstones comic is literally already about Barnie and Fred atoning for their war crimes.
The flint stones is just a modern reboot away from being about cucking.
That was pretty much the most popular television subject.
Almost every 90s sitcom is literally about cucking
Dude
Dude
Dude
Shield: Agents of Cuck
That probably means he's super into being the agent of the cuck.
Yeah but think about that
Lol
I want to get cucked by Notch.
I want there to be less than 1 degree of depression between my girlfriend's vagina and Notch.
Hmm.
I see your dilemma.
Instant success.
You need to make a twitter for your dildo and just only use it to spam Notch.
Does it serve as a platform for her social issues?
No?
Not enough.
Start building its brand.
Really get its social media presence going.
You should make a Facebook page for it
lol fucking nice.
What's Mr.
Dildo's name?
Bourtney
Same thing happened last time I bought a blender.
You gotta watch out for that shit.
Yeah
<@!125452744440938497> the latest mbmbam episode is just them talking about twin peaks
you're just gonna leave
wow mac
and you passed
that was a test
good answer ronald
so who is your favorite final fantasy character ronald?
my internet went out
yeah plz don't distrub me ronald
hi ronald
They don't fuck around.
You should play chess with ronald or I some time.
I just liek thte style of the second
they are both really good
ive played the frist too
the second one is amazing
ive played it
I dont see how those two levels could have taken 16 hours though
there are two levels that I skipped
lol
I feel like I'm missing somethin
wtf
lol recomended time to beat kh was 28 hours
goofy
jane from tarzan
she's got the best ass in all kingdom hearts
god tinkerbell got that ass though
But i love it
This is also a sign of the end times
Ahhhh I love it
....
‚úàÔ∏èüå™ü¶Üüêâ‚ò†Ô∏è
Getting all their groceries.
Stay safe
Love you asher.
No there is no English version
ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I thought so at least
There is
^
Koiking is the shit over there
And magikarp is way more of a brand in Japan than slowpoke
Because it was timed perfectly with the new game.
That no one listens to
Stop ruining the playlist
Omg stop
Lvl 20 what noob are you?
So true
"Evolving it to gyrados makes it really strong, but getting there takes way too long"
Although I love the lyrics
It's like the mimikyu song but way worse
You should have known.
For a Pokemon thing.
2 weeks is so old
So I had to hear it all the time
Yeah we put it on the stores pipeline the day is came out
It is driving me crazy
I've been listening to this literally everyday at the store
Mac this is so old
We scared him
Oh.
All by himself
Lol
^
Oooof
Lol yeah.
Because if they aren't then those other places take their business
That's why smaller stores are pressured to stay open
Exactly
^
Lol
Not unless you sound like a total tool.
So there are all these poems from a thousand years ago that are supposed to rhyme but just don't anymore.
Which is super fucking cool.
This is actually really interesting mac because early and Middle English is a whole different pronunciation where all of those words do rhyme
Mac you should really watch more of sumo so I have someone to talk with about it
üëèüèæüëçüèæüí©
Hopefully in that order.
He's alive
Here he comes
Oh shit
‚úàÔ∏èüå™‚ò†Ô∏è
Guys what if Ronald's plane crashed.
And playing on my gameboy hoping my coach wouldn't notice.
That video brings back my six years of soccer
Lol
It is terrifying
And now it is just tracking them to the ends of the earth
But the idea is that in the first episode they pissed off a bewear
Ywah
It wasn't their fault
They didn't do it
?
It's beautiful
Because the way they have team rocket blasting off is the way every episode is
Also I'm so excited for you to see the ending.
ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è it's like a weird thing everyone in the show asks
Because they are related
And the baseball dude
It's like his thing
Only oak does that
I honestly though meowth was going to fucking mega evolve when he was up to pitch.
Yeah dawg
It's pretty bonkers.
But not to this level.
It's not normally this bonkers.
I mean that's just one special episode.
Yup
And alolan oak is the principal
He's just in school
Yeah also ash doesn't travel at all
Sumo anime is the best
Yeah dawg
Because it is terrifying.
I love it
Ik it's just crazy to see.
Every episode.
Mimikyu wants to fucking kill pikachu
Like team rocket wants to catch pikachu
Mimikyu fucking DESPISES pikachu
So just so you know in the sun and moon anime
And it is fucking great.
There is this anime about a high school ping pong team that is directed just like this episode
Fucking love it
Bulge
Why does every character in player unknown have an enormous bludge?
I love it
I love how anime sun and moon is
Did you get to mimikyu yet?
So I makers sense that the best Pokemon episode is about baseball
The best xmen comics are when they play baseball.
Best
Because it's the fucking beat
Lol
Just like soccer was created in England
I mean it was created in America
It's like our football there.
It's the most popular sport in Japan.
Lol
Lol did you watch the episode yet?
Why did you say more time for <:god:230133457630658562> ?
Mac
Are you playing magikarp?
Are you playing Pokemon?
?
<@!127535721857679362> you've upset us all
YOU FOOL
RONALD
Why do I do this to myself.
God the flash is so not good.


It looks the quality that I think about <:armboy:307590740496875531>
I just love that it's so on point
Same <:armboy:307590740496875531>
Yeah
He's the best.
I saw it all
My goal in life is to be friends with nick Robinson.
https://instagram.com/p/BUnyIcqFkkS/
It'll all be the same.
28
Idk.
Just look for the the episode.
I've got a time turner.
I'm magic
They play Pok√©mon baseball
It's fucking bonkers
And this episode was exceptionally good
Because it's Pokemon?
I've watched most of them.
Yeah no problem.
Came out this morning.
It's the latest sun and moon episode.
Inteenet
It's worth the 20 minutes
Please do
Come on man
Fuck
!!!!!
Mac did you watch that episode.
Nah.
He's going to  exit  the gate and just sit down in the middle of the airport and play dota
It's unbecoming
Don't brag ronald
Give me 26 hours.
I'm on a flight.
K
That we can just look at each other naked
üëçüèæ
X-ray mods only
Let's start our own server ronald.
I can play anytime
Yeah
Nice ronald!
They are challenging people to break it
DRM
Yeah
Digital rights management.
<@!71716577669550080> did you see rime's drm challenge?
You beat it?
ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Lol
For the server
Get it
Third sign of the apocalypse
Just like a blu ray
Yeah they have scratch resistant layers.
Persona?
Yes.
My skull?
No.
My brain isn't worth 60 bucks
I really would wear a helmet they are just so expensive.
Yeah but if you take a dive in those things you feel like a fucking badass
I'm too lazy to buy a new one after it got stolen
I ride without a helmet
You just become the worlds largest asshole
I guess if you are in a college town it's doable
I'd be curious to see how long that lasts
Lol
Then you'd just be perpetuating the cycle
And what if you run a red light?
Because then you'll forget how to drive
Ronald...you can't
Which hurts to say
Macs bike is officially better than mine
I still commute but my bike isn't good enough for riding casually
Not really ever since my bike got stolen
It's alright though.
I sill have two more battles to redeem myself
Also nidoking is fat
Yeah but he was five levels higher
Alas that blunder cost me the battle
I mistakingly thought that my eggexutor would be faster than his nidoking
Like a fool
I got beat in gen 1 Pokemon today.
Consider its ronald id give
Give or take 6 hours
Yeah 36
16 bucks for 26 hours
Ff?
Did you get free?
By the time you get back I'll be better than you.
I practice dota then
Awesome.
They have these hybrids with land iguanas that are beautiful and truly the next evolution of iguana but unfortunately all the hybrids are sterile.
Dope I love marine iguanas.
They are my favorite reptiles.
Can I borrow it after you asher?
If you skip to the second song it's fucking terrible
https://youtu.be/nEruxEBsB0c
Yeah
Also we are selling used switch joycon set for 74.99 which is crazy but I guess makes sense
Mac#3165 we've already gotten 3rd party switch hardware
Why
Savanah monitor
Nice
I want to play it at the store
lol.
why?
Because he was done.
Can't blame him.
Same guy traded botw and mk
Because no one bought 1-2 switch
<@!71716577669550080>  someone just fucking brought Mario kart to the store
FUCK
wtf
cloud is a boss
holy shit
Oof
OP
wtf saving heals you?
Biggest update ever
Lol
Jack Kirby and Joe Simon

Fucking terrible CW
epsidoe 14- WHAT A GUY NAMED HUNTER ZOLOMON WAS EVIL THIS WHOLE TIME!!?!?!?
episdoe 4 - his name is hunter zolomon, seems like a nice guy
holy shit
like this
The more I sit on the parts of twin peaks i dont like the more i like them
<@!125452744440938497>
ghosts are really cool
this just reminded me
guys
this is like playing "the game"
FUCK
I had forgotten about it until just now
dammit asher
And everyone is gone
I JUST NAMED IT
I just schrodinger's cat that shit
I just quantum observed the flash
10 minutes later "holy shit, it's a time wraith"
and I was like "that's a pretty cool image its like a sort of time wraith"
i was watching the flash and this ghost looking like thing came from a time portal
LOL HOLY SHIT
its been a while
ü§∑üèø
and not be free
without discounts
for the gba
I got it for 16
not really
also if southwest has a sale for august the cheapest its going to be is like 200-250 can you afford that?
or 4
yeah get 6
don't buy the first one
what do you mean "like rpgs?"
but i bet your mom can find a way to get a discount
probably 800 total
400 per round trip ticket
thats gonna be like 400 bucks
like its in july right?
they are going to be really pricey this close
has asher gotten tickets?
why don't you need to buy plane tickets?
Can your mom really get you 2 free tickets?
?
did you buy plane tickets?
coo
you gys find a roomie?
*creamfaced business boy*
thats the most i would ever pay for a watch
oof
its probably going to be my favorite movie ever
I'm kinda excited it looks buck fucking wild
also Ronald we should see kingsman 2 together
it is just character writing shorthand so they don't actually have to make the character relatable or human in any way
It's the same problem as using queer imagery for villians
we don't need you to actually say the phrase "I need a fix"
we get the parralels
its just bad bad writing
BAD WRITING
I AM UPSET
but there's not
it'd be different if there was a major super hero who was literally a addict to get super powers
yeah it does humanize villians but it also demonizes them because addiction is viewed as a moral failing in our society
man this would make a great tumblr post
you didn't need to fucking add junkies to the list
there are already enough problems with the depiciting villians with emotional or physical health problems
WE FUCKING GET IT
also another trope I don't like is sci fi serums being treated like heroin
it is in my favorite superman comic of all time
no because its in literally every comic
you suck barru
like this girl just took some flash serum and then kicked the flashes ass
It always makes me think about how shitty the hero actuallyis
is when someone gets the same powers as someone else and is immediately as good as them
you know what my favorite trope in the super hero genre is
its scary
everyones eyes in kh are dead as fuck though
its got a pretty good ost
its called Kingdom Hearts
yo you ever hear of this lil' indie game i've been playing recently
and ASS
its just clevage
because mac
yup
another sign of the end times
Overwatch has introduced white men to thicc
lol
they used to just masturbate in their closets like the rest of us
I love that perverts know just run youtube channels
this man knows his asses
and like those <:boobies:232323564764659713> games
i think its mainly anime
just a dude talkaing about cartoon asses
yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPXwabmMBZw
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jigRNsCV6Xs
He had this feud with a pro wrestler and it was the fucking best  marketing stunt ever
idk
Have you seen him wrestling?
GOd
that would be amazing
he beat the world record
"Oh that?
It was way too boring and political so we just replaced it with Global Ninja Warrior."
"dad what happened to the olympics"
I love how ANW has become the new test for physical perfection
following him everywhere
but its just funny there is this tiny woman
lol i have no idea
*does one more*
CROWD EXPLODES
"I want to do one more"
Finishes america ninja warrior
I love when marketing stunts are actually good
just like power rangers
I love that cw can't afford real actors because it means the stuntsmen are the actors
http://www.cbr.com/stephen-amell-dominates-american-ninja-warrior/?utm_source=CBR-TW&utm_medium=Social-Distribution&utm_campaign=CBR-TW&view=list
its funny because arrow is such a terrible show and his character is terrible but stephen amell is such a nice guy in real human life
literally every writing class is just the same but is filled with slightly more cynical people the higher up you get
good
"Recommended"
W 401 : Recommended - ENG-W 301 or equivalent
Its also full for this semester so I don't know if it would be a good idea emailing just to get on the waitlist or just wait to get a guaranteed spot
yeah
it just needs the permission from the professor
I looked it up though and the 400 class doesnt have any strict prerequisites
plus its the same professor in the 300 and 400 class
that much i know
its not
instead of 4 and 4
so it will be 3 and 5
That means I'll have to take 5 classes in the spring though
maybe I should just wait to do it until spring semester so it seems more desperate and I can go to his office hours during the fall that way I'm not just a faceless email.
lol k
yeah can you do me a favor
and its sort of shitty if i'd be like "hey remember two years ago when you told me I showed a lot of promise and then left the department?"
i just don't think he'd remember
the professor i'm asking to let me into the 400 class is the same professor who told me that
a note?
so I doubt he'd remember
but I didn't because I thought I meet the requirement
the professor of the class I want to get into said he wanted me to come to office hours and what not so he could talk with me about my options of taking a more advanced writing education
but when I took the 200 class which was two years ago
and i don't know if I can use this
heres also the thing
and I've done 100-200 and I just need 400 for credit
it goes 100-200-300-400
well heres the thing
because its a writing class and that's a waste of time since they are all easy
How do i ask a professor to let me into an advanced class that I don't have the prerequisites for because I need the credits and don't need to take the prerequisite class
which has been changing my life
also they added lucha underground to netflix
I love it
Flash is a really bad show
Lefty and Righty
her and robocop
weird shes my least favorite
does anyone play arms d.v.a?
cool
as you know üë©üèø
I thought you meant ribbon girl "black" variant
oh
medusa beyonce
we can't have same main
shit
I'm gonna main thicc queen
you main minmin?
<:armboy:307590740496875531>
lol
Cool?
Arms?
did you not play?
howd it go?
or can you only do it once
all of the times?
let me know how it goes
you testpunching?
up before noon
look at us all
hey guys
the Digmoggle set also makes me want to bust a nut
spindo is p cool
lol that is bananas.

There are so many zippers in this game
I love goofy
Super nuzlocke
All their names sound the same to me
I think
Is that it detaches you from the characters.
That's what I heard was one of the criticisms of the last game
Genius
One of the collectibles is getting all 101 Dalmatians
Nice
How much?
But I really like it
I thought I would hate the Disney stuff in kingdom hearts
Yeah.
Yeah but the same could be said about something like borderlands
YES
Holy shit.
There are moogles in this game
I'm just not interested in hunting endangered dinosaurs
Yeah I get it
So it just feels like a hunting sim
They just sort of lack character
I just don't like the monsters
I played the Wii U one and I thought it kinda sucked
lol I wish I knew anything about monster hunter
pleeeeeeease Oh baby,
You don't hear me say
When you walk away.
Oof so sleepy
Lol
Turns out there were consequences for dating multiple people.
Lol oh fuck
Oh fuck
That way they don't need to worry about if you are or aren't dating them.
I love that everyone's dialogue is just naturally flirtatious.
Time to watch some sexy cutscenes.
It's Valentine's Day.
Oh shit
12-24 is the last dateable day
But 12-24 when the cutscenes begin.
Then it ends 3-21 a full year
3-21 to 12-24
I mean there are but I'd have to minmax it
Yeah but there aren't enough days
I also never got a job but still ended up with a shit ton of money.
They are very helpful in game
You're joking but that's legitr
I regret not dating the fortune teler
Goty
But with my gun.
It was literally like the scene in Peter Pan where the revive tinker bell.
So very realistic.
And then I shot god
So I had everyone believe in my big gun
So the place where you do all the fighting is just a physical representation of unconscious minds
The conceit of the game is that cognition determines reality.
They are toys
Spoilers btw
I shot him with a gun
I killed god
No
And now I'm on a date
I killed god mac
Lol
üò¶
But I still got cutscenes to watch
So tired
There was no good stopping point.
Yeah.
I goofed
Hi mac
K the end of the boss fight is p dope though.
That you are supposed to grind on.
Gives a long as dungeon with a bunch of easy boring mobs
So asher persona does exactly what smt did
I did but I forgot pants!
Oh.
No!
And I didn't study for Spanish!
It's so late
By far the *hardest* character in the game

IFOUND IT
Omg
Nice job persona.
A little bit of a gap
And here the weakest thing is 70
And so the last fighting area the strongest level thing was level 60
Lol so I was wondering why the difficulty seemed to spike up at the final dungeon
Morgana is so much more bad ass than he gets credit for.
It was really good like ten minutes ago
It had so much momentum and now it's just killing it
Lol holy fuck.
What a terrible part of the game
Asher.
The power of friendship is so strong
This is like fucking durian
This is beyond bananas.
Hjghvygfg
this just took a total 180
RUCKBSHEUS
ME
OH FUCK
BABAHHSKSHH

Holy shit.
Things are getting crazy
Persona is taking forever.
I know
Lol
Weird.
lol holy fuck.
John Mayer has a switch
No.
I meant to text that.
A couple of Sumerian goddesses.
The spirit the daughter and the earth.
The end times
Fuck.
About Sheldon as a kid.

Memories.

Mac.
How much fe have you played?
Gotcha
Lol even though you've only played an hour of persona.
It would make classes way easier
Mac I'm listening to Dumas ordeal for the first time
Works perfectly
The word robot means slave labor.
"Life is like a mine, it's dark, wet and exploits its workers"
Lol they just need proverbs.
Lol fuck

So sad:-(
That's very big of you.
its in the grid
yes
plz retweet
about the bold direction the series is taking
I really think its going to get people talking
The graphics are going to cahnge everything

I put them side by side so you could see the difference from fallout 4
and he game me some leaked pictures of fallout 5
my dad works for bethesda
this reminds me
by the way mac
they just put orange over it and when everyone gets bored they take it away
orange
its all the same filter
its not different filters
*want a new game?* Just add orange
fallout 3
http://www.techspot.com/articles-info/125/images/High_02T.jpg
new vegas
http://i35.tinypic.com/16k2xwl.png
they did the same for fallout
they made it orange
just fucking look at that
its a whole new game
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wTs2TYoKLQE/maxresdefault.jpg
mac
its basically elder scrolls 6
are you kidding mac?!
and also they got that hd remaster which with all the new features is basically a new game
I don't know though guys, bethesda is probably floating off of the bank from teso
or tes levels of gap
or fallout levels of gap
18 months?
less than two years?
so you know they've probably forgotten all about tes
bethesda literally just released prey
who knows
eh
i konw thats what worries me
no but possibly the nintendo one
ill probably be at work for some of these times
and ea and devolver
so
that or just random ones not at cons

üòπüôÄüòªüòªüòπ

GAME OF THE FUCKING YEAR
THE TWIST ASHER
FUCK OH FUCK
HOLY FUCK
Yeah
Philip says he can't make it
I love the rpg mechanic though that you can just max out your knowledge, charm, kindness, guts, and proficiency in less than a year.
I hope I'm almost done because I'm loosing steam pretty quick
Lol so I'm either v close to beating persona.
Or half way
If not I can just use an apple tv
So I'll have to see if Amazon will work
Because the PS4 I don't think has a showtime app
I'll try to get it set up tomorrow afternoon
Cool
Do you know if it is available to stream right at 9?
I doubt I'll be down for that.
But we will see.
K
Oof
Also asher are we watching all four episodes?
Or just he first two?
I got all the login and stuff
Already did.
But my dad gets it free through his amazon prime
Bingo
As much as hbo is real tv
It's in showtime
I'm still not sure if philip can come.
Oh yeah I forgot about that okay.
Or play games on my brand new tv
Why not.
You can just play switch
It's okay Mac we can play silent hill tomorrow and get you a Snapchat
Lol
Pic?
That's pretty funny
You got it
Apparently it's baffles condom manufacturers too.
Apparently the Japanese just stopped fucking somewhere in the 90s and now the government has to come up with ducking incentives.
They are easy to figure out with even the slightest contextual clues.
Also Mac all the problems with translation are bullshit
I did some research and apparently Japanese teens don't have premarital sex
We just cuddled and then she went home before 11
This is the most g rated m rated game I've ever played
Sigh *unzip*

Lol
I just really hope the hail didn't damage my car.
Very pretty storm.
Yeah I follow them on YouTube.
I need to start following animation composers
Yeah
I really need to get more into Japanese underground animation.
Also that remix of the queen of the night aria is one of the best creations of the modern age
Lol yeah that'd be fucked up to see
Love that first classic one
Lol ive had that experience watching at high several times
No but I just unlocked Alice in persona.
Lol
Young Sherilyn Fenn gives me life

and then watch the third season with us
you should do that with twin peaks
I agree
yeah mac
you know what actually
that...
I feel like if you watch the first episode, the episode where buster dies, and the last episode you've really experieced it
so far its been true
bonkeriest
this is the most bonkers
also asher this is no different from twin peaks
lol the last episode of car boys was bonkers
6000 hours
60 hours later finally got to level 40
She's the prettiest lady
Yeah but I wanted to see her in that pink room scrne
I hate movie Donna
Yeah
Lol
Why did they lose Donna for the film btw
Yeah she's a crazy good actress
lol that's crazy
Whoa
Before or after the show started?
Also asher when was Laura's killer determined?
With supernatural shit
Because twin peaks is actually surrealist whereas lost is just scifi
But tbf lost is nowhere near as weird as twin peaks.
Yeah.
And isn't explained for another ten episodes
Because it lasts ten seconds rather than 6 minutes
There's like a lot of shit in the show like that and you do just ignore it
Seems legit
Other than the guy having the dream is the protagonist there is nothing in that video that uses previously established information.
Is also important Mac to know that there is no context for that video
Yeah it's funny in middle school I tried watching it but after the first episode I was like wtf this is boring normal stuff
That's the cool thing about the show is that if you real a plot summary it seems normal until you actually watch the show.
Still entertaining but incomprehensible
It's a very weird surrealist show mac that has a lot of tiny little plot lines that would make it seems incomprehensible if you've never seen the show
They realized how it didn't really catch on when it first came out so they are hoping to tag on to a new demographic.
Yeah that's what I heard
Lol
Nah dude.
There's not a lot to it.
It's really norm core
Like I said
Yup
Bingo
Sort of like a Pokemon movie
That was showing yesterday.
There is a movie
Twin peaks
And when she left after the rape scene I felt real bad
I heard her talking about how she had never seen the show before hand
Yeah I saw that
Aka where I fell in love with Adam Brody
No mac I meant the show "The OC"
Twin peaks is norm corr
Nah lost is a little too edgy and weird.
It's basically just like watching the oc
Yup
Yeah
I can't find any reliable sources online
Yeah they are really cool
Anything that pupates
Agree actually
I would only be to breed them
I wonder how much they go online fore
?
Fucking finally
Just got the shotgun asher
I meet with phil and sam at 8:30 so by the time we get there it'll probably be close to it
There's a comic store?!
<@!125452744440938497> where is this thing at?
She so built.
So stacked.
Yeah let's just hang around noon.
I can drop you off at class if you want
Well I have work at 4 so that defeats the point actually
Do you have class Friday?
üò¶
Because I have dinner at 6
Preferably in the afternoon
Anytime.
Mac do you want to hang tomorrow?
Yeah I can do that I reckon
<@!125452744440938497> ?
What time is it?
140

deviantart comes to life
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/16/sonic-forces-character-creation-feature-mode-announced
lol sonic forces is going to be the most popular sonic game of all time
Asher and I have spent many years at that part
Mac
Lol
Play one of the 100 games you have but haven't beaten
Ugh
Fuck
Yeah dude.
We were saving it for your birthday
Gets me everytime
Lol
I haven't played it since Saturday.
Idk
I'm busy playing ff14
It's even in the name
With 5 people
In its prime
Those were the days
Because that sounds like they are making a movie glorifying bundy
I'm more interested in "psychology thriller"
Sounds about right.
Mac did you look up that dude?
I'm off at 9
Dope.
Oh yeah I forgot.
You down tomorrow?
Like not in a funny way
I got really good touch wctually
Lol my senses are v bad.
Sight is all I got
I also can't smell
Nice
I wish I could hear the difference in things.
lol
How much?
Lol
like hl2 and portal
because it has heavy modern influences
except prey is better
I'm a couple hours in, prey is just literally system shock 3
K
Did you look her up?
<@!125452744440938497> Haru is literally pearl if she was a phantom thief.
Haru-chan is so stylish I wish she wasn't so terrible.
Cool
I'm p sure my dad does yeah
Cool I'll talk to the gang then.
Also when are you free for our next twin peaks?
Pre nes gaming is honestly fucking baffling to a millennial like me.
Yah dawg.
Let's get into the meta

You ready for our next evolution in multiplayer experience boys?

Im sorry to hear than man:-/
I see how it is.
K Mac
It's called the last story.
Also asher I got this xseed rpg you may enjoy
everyone we should really find an rpg that we all start at the same time.
This is my favorite jrpg
I unlocked "special massage"
This is the "hardest" romance questline.
I better get an achievement for this.
Fucked my teacher.
Lol nvm
And if I don't do well on my entrance exams makato-San will never want to date me.
I went all beta because I was afraid it would effect my grades
My biggest regret in persona.
Asher.
Promise me you will be more bold than me and try to fuck your teacher.
I'm now at comics are bad.
That's been the last 5 years
Holy fuck
<@!71716577669550080> karts?
this howcast can't take themselves seriously
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yXiUco7gHE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-fu-vtuzwY
this is the best resource i could find
I'm trying to find it
what the fuck is it?
is it literally just the song?
what is the bart man?
Hey @everyone
It wants me to date literally any other anime girl
the game is doing very bad job supporting my love for makato right now
<@!71716577669550080> read the avalanche page.
Mac I want you to get this game so we can play together.
Lol
It's really fun
I just bought it
Mac look up dragon quest heroes rocket slime
Lol <@!71716577669550080> are you reading this
It's apparently in first person
I think
The remaster comes out in Japan only
Yeah
It's got p good ratinngs
I bought it for the ds
Remaster?
No
<@!125452744440938497>  I just brought smt strange journey.
Hmm
I thought I was decent
Hmm
You like it
lol
I wonder what his score is
<@!71716577669550080> nick talks about tumbleseed in the latest cgi
Arc
Also her character arch is identical to peridots which is funny
She's so your type
She is literally peridot
Omg <@!125452744440938497> you are going to love makato
But no anime girl box
I definitely have been embarrassed many times playing this though at how many times I've been so proud when I make someone blush with a compliment.
Let's me get real fucking close though.
Actually Kawakami sempai is my true waifu but the game won't let me date her
Especially because it is 99% because I want to connect with my anime waifu
Hmm the only question then would be if I'd look like a total tool if I got them
She's my favorite character
Are they good quality?
Lol
I changed some enemy names
no
oh well ill believe it
but the lore seems to seperate them
hmmm
I think they are different
I don't think the final boss is the gfs
mac
sitting next to hannah just wokring on the iwki
I'm home now
I'm at work
Which is way easier when shit ain't following you
And it's all just me dodging shit
Then I don't have to worry about tracking
Because I think that would be pro
I want to try it with cloakfruit
You just need a really strong offensive item to pair it with
Lol
?
Also works well with bombs
I got over 50 crystal using it in combination with avalanche
And then get more hearts
Because you can get it and just kill everything to get a shit ton of coins
It's perfect if you don't get hit
Lol
You plant for free while at 1 heart
Freeloader
I've official found the best aura
<@!71716577669550080>
I'll run it by everyone.
Coo coo coo
Shows like psyche and dexter I have a special place on my heart for but have literally no interest in seeing them again.
No one cares about the yin yang killer
Then he can appreciate better than anyone how bad a psych movie sounds.
Also the holiday episodes were always the worst ones.
I thought you were being funny
You like it?
Hmm Wednesday?
As far as the movies relation to the actual tp show
I get that reference now
Lol
That's how you know a shitty movie is in the worjs
Eww
Huh weird.
The edits still aren't updating for me
Lol
Mac can you link me to wiki?
Ugh I have to hang with hannah tonight but I just want to work in wiki
Cool
Like dev stuff?
What will we use other for?
Okay
U locks are the only way to go
Just a shitty rope one
Or other --> campaign I think
Other --> lore
Campaign in other?
Although I have no idea how old he is
The new employee we hired at this store is going well though.
Apparently we are letting him go soon anyway
I just think it's really funny that if your feeling are hurt you call a manager at home.
Instead of just handling it passive aggressively like abnormal person.
New at working maybe.
At no company
Lol it 100% is not
I get that but who thinks it's a good idea to call the manager on his day off to complain about how this guy who has been there way longer was short with him
Who the fuck does that
So apparently some new guy at the other store just called eric and said I was "mean to him"
Yeah prey looks nice
Yeah I just confirmed it
Okay you are right
Ehhhh
Do you have evidence for that?
THEN WHAT ARE THE GHOST THINGS!
Whoaa
So are the vine guard the non seed things in the shrines?
"Blessed is the seed who reaches the peak for their growth shall restore order and order shall restore balance within our mighty mountain home"
Not
I was.
It expecting this
Deep
Holy shit this lore goes dee
Good summer project
Lol this is fun mac
lol I love that people are actually editing this
Yeah
its still a pretty good score though for no items
so proud of myself though literally increased my record by 200 in the same ammount of time
also i need to make a page for the Thornguard
like Mount Seed is actually just The Mountain
so there are some things that actually need to be changed on the wiki
and he is where all the lore is from
also i talked a lot with the librarian
lol
that means i should be able to break 800 in a few days
9:54
627
79 globally
NEW RECORD
<@!71716577669550080> I got a new quote from the boss
WHAT THE FUCK IS RISKY?
"nothing risky coming from jeffs side"
"one mistake and really it can just mess everything up"
"you see skip the key to winning tetris is all in getting tetrises"
and theres a tetris!"
"he seems to be setting up a tetris
he's got a tetris there"
"oh boy looks like he
because its tetris
I love the commentators have nothing to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdfRQjb5o9k
yeah
but dont crystals also factor?
do we know the actual formula yet by which high scores are calculated?
he so deserves it though so I'm planning on writing the best letter I can
he is an assistant professor but is up for a promotion for next semester to actual faculty
so i got an email from the history department asking if i would want to make a letter of recomendation for my favorite teacher
ill do lore at work
No idea
Yeah
Got it
Then how do we explain it when the rng makes two seedy joes spawn next to eachother?
Because multiple of the same seeds appear in the same run all the time
S do you think seeds should be represented as individuals or as clans
For sure
Planking
I love what you did with the holes page
Lol mac
Nice what is it
From the tutorial
God.
She deserves a page more than most
Ahh too scary
But yet still to scared to go into the jungle
I'm gonna make turdly one of the wisest
Now you know
I just woke up briefly at 4:30 to say bye to the Japanese.
I don't even know who that is
Apparently "classic flintler" is now a meme?
So tired
We should attach that and still say at least 7
Holy fuck
Lol
Lol
Under the front page pictue
Even so in need to redo that paragraph tomorrow
lol did someone change the front page to say anytitty or was that a typo
Looks good on mobile
Lol nice.
Also we need to find out how to change the theme of the site from blue to green
I told him I'd quote him
Lol make sure to make it a wuote
Lol "confirmed 7 at least"
ronald play mario with us
if only hlaf o fgarfiled episodes were like this
holy shit
i was just thinking that
http://tumbleseed.wikia.com/wiki/Holes?venotify=created
http://tumbleseed.wikia.com/wiki/Flagseed
In assuming that battle would be the easier one.
Because I was right
I killed dagda
It's Sophie's choice over here
But I also feel like they are more useful than dagda
I love dagda and hate my friends
Time to weigh some pros and cons
Pineapple#3564 oh boy

But I don't think I've unlocked her
Just did beelzebub.
I want Alice thiugh
30 thank you
Lol king frost
Just did my first special fusion at level 82.@l <@!125452744440938497>
üòÉ
I'm looking at how to edit this and I'm gonna need some help mac
can you set me as an administrator + bureaucrat for Tumbleseed Wiki?
I bought this game on launch day, and I'd love to help turn this wiki into an actual wiki üòÉ
I need to give you the account login so you can make yourself admin
Of course the internet is out at the store.
And I have a bunch of requests for edits on the wiki
I just checked my email
Lol <@!71716577669550080>
Yeah
Now they are better that me
They just needed time
Ds
They are they just haven't played since de
And they didn't sucj
It allowed me to play with my Japanese friends.
The auto steer is the best feature ever
Mac you are right
god this is sexual
she white
it nier
i was like wtf is this
oh shit
this is what i wanted to do but not
lol
And get the worst version of animal crossing
Now I can finally play the shittier version of games

My Japanese n64 just came in
Yeah that's what all the podcasts have been saying
Yo what if Archie was a murder mystery
Looks fucking bonkers.
Yeah I'm so excited to watch it
Lol
You'll be a pro Mario kart player in no time
lol nice
Yeah
That's entire strat
I was doing the same
lol I would have been second if you didn't hit me
Lol we suck
Got now I want to hook up my n64 and play real Mario kart
And it was 4 players
And the fact that if someone found you it was easy to take advantage of
Smaller stages
The whole point is to be the last one standing.
1/10 ign
That sucks
Eww
Why does it put you back in of you loose your balloons?
Wait wtf
Probably based on score
Not really
Yeah but auto targeting items make that not tall legit
Lol but it's just sort of boring because if you have it all you are doing is just driving hoping for the best
I really don't like this game mode.
It's just sort of boring.
It's just not loosing yours
The objective isn't taking those balloons though.
Balloon is just literally call of duty with go karts
Balloon isn't about collecting dummy
lol it's really funny when you are so wrong
This isn't even a real battle mode
See what I mean though.
False
I hate this one
No
Ugh
Are we doing balloon?
Lol
Battle?
I think every item in the game hit me
üò¶
That was hard
It looks fun
All I care about are balloons
Nice
Yeah.
We are winners
That's a cool stage too
That bomb though.
It's okay.
Even pros come in second sometimes if date deals them a blue shell
It was pretty great to watch
Three
Theee
That's a good level
God I like this game.
It's so beautiful
My fav is super circuit
No that's the best one
Ds
Even more than da
That was my favorite mk game
I gotta get my hours in
Again?
It wasn't like that at all
Like even the old ones are way different
I also really like that every course is new to me
It's so much fun just being able to casually play again
Last time I owned one that was recent was ds
God I fucking love owning a recent mk game again
Why?
I like him?
I love wario
Lol
Ugh k
Because she was raised a fundamentalist Christian
I'm playing ts
Start the party
lol I was explaining the plot to hannah and it genuinely upset her
I gotta lot of time to kill tomorrow so I'll probably beat ot
Cool I'm excited
Because the estimated time for the game is like 45 hours but I'm only at like 25 and I can't imagine having 20 more hours.
Hey <@!125452744440938497> about what percent am I done.
I just beat danus mom
20 minutes.
Mac
Okay just don't go to bed before midnight.
Ma make sure you stay up late enough so we can get a game in.
Beezlebub
Omg.
My favorite giy
Shits getting real in the egg
Just beat odin
What if
The future is now
Lol
Not for me
Ugh
And they wake up at 6 every day
Yeah normally I could sleep in but my room is a Japanese frat house
I celebrated finishing finals with playing smt all night.
Now I'm sick.
<@!125452744440938497> just beat lucifer
like the whole summer
im actually making plans to spend next summer in hong kong
we just hired two new people
anyway I'll actually do that ronald
lol
I'll honestly quit my job and just chill wherever you are staying
ronald can i come with you?
dont get it ronald
yeah
I'm also always scared that they are going to do something stupid
But yeah I need to end things, maybe next week idk
but realized it didn't and was chill
mainly because he thought it was going to effect him
no he was like legit pissy though
Philip literally said "keenan please don't fuck her"
I would talk with philip or sam but they told me not to date her in the first place so it is a little weir
I haven't really got these out in the open
Thasnks for talkingn with me about this by the way
with Hannah I feel no rage or sadness, I just don't want to.
Like with megan i felt like I was about to do something I would regret with all my bottled up rage
with hannah it is different
megan i mean
with hannah i was literally at a breaking point
which is hard to watch
yeah but to her i am
no matter how you put it, that shit is personal
but it is v hard and almost impossible to do without insulting someone
which i mean i totally should have to justify to someone why i don't want to continue a relationship
I also hate having to justify these things
but I'm always the fucking bad guy
I just hate being the bad guy
yeah...
thank god
yeeeeah, that's the thing Hannah has also never seen a picture of megan
which is fair because she has been cheated on
but there's no way in fuck Hannah would be cool with that
because we would hang every now and again
Yeah, its gonna be weird when she gets back though
which is huge for her
Yeah she said she hasn't actively hated herself the entire time
*seeing the sun*
so she's doing well which is really good to hear but even better to hear was how the thing she probably needs most is something that is just fundamentally not in my character
just sort of kept her inside both physically and emotionally
Megan and I had a really nice talk though, because she's been outside everyday for the last semester and it has done wonders for her mental health and how much she needs it.
Which makes a lot of sense because I would always do whatever I wanted to do and I never wanted to go outside
perpetually fucking and playing katamari
thats because i was isolated
because she just made me angry, which wasn't her fault
especially because for the last four months of me and megan I felt uncomfortable being near her
yeah but tbf that was pretty early in our relationship
lol yeah
along with just sort of experimenting a little and being less self consious
watching you and Clara honestly helped me out with that
also i only recently became comfortable with pda in general
because I always thought of her as out of my league
I think i was honestly intimidated to have public displays with megan
hmm idk probably
yeah I'm definitly still the catalyst for them all
but realized that was not the case
I thought she was friends with philiip when we started dating because of jazz
she really isnt friends with them
eh not as much as youd think
for the summer
but she talked about how she'd essentially be all alone
because I thought it would be earlier to be honest
like when is most fair to her
Yeah, honeslty at this point I just don't know when I'm supposed to end it
but regardless, I just have this gut feeling that I don't want to make things work with Hannah
it makes me feel like i'm always the youngest one in the room
It's honestly probably mostly my height that gets me
yeah, see I developed this entire sort of charima with women out of what I thought was desperation
just sort of a self image thing
because I behave like I'm ugly because I was treated that way, so I still haven't accepted that I'm not
and hurts a lot of people despite my intention
because it is a real problem for me
That's something I really need to get better about
it just sort of happened
yeah, I was honestly never trying to engage in a relationship with Hannah
but that regression would be almost impossible after half a year of dating
and I feel like that's a role I better fill for her
because she needs that more than anything
I wish I never dated hannah but just made her a really great friend
yeah I think about that a lot
and it turns out all the ways that made me feel comfortable made her feel uncomfortable
but then she began the gain more confidence and express what she was feeling
I was really comfortable with Hannah in the beginning
yeah
but overall, if you are selectively choosing the aspects of someone, it's not great.
yeah, which i get is hard in a relationship with me because my behavior is relatively erratic
but at 21 years old I honeslty dont think I should be committing myself to a relationship where I have to "tone myself down"
which I get, because my personality can draw those out
which really come out at times
she just has a lot of insecurity issues
I know where it comes from though
which I get may be triggering, but some of those things are either a part of me or part of an ideology that needs discourse if it is ever going to change
like she has specifically told me not to talk about things.
but she sort of demands this transparancy from me, which I so eagerly give, and she sort of just selects what she does and doesn't want
not in regards to sex, because I honestly don't really care about that
physically and emotionally
She's also not comfortable with me which makes me feel really weird
not like superficial priorities but emotional ones
I feel like her priorities exist so far outside of my own that together we cover a lot of ground, but ultimately remain pretty stagnate
I don't feel that with Hannah
another thing is I feel like Clara either pushes you or has the potential to
and get in relationship I shouldnt get into, for way longer than I should
otherwise I get way too comitted
so I try to always keep that in perspective
and my relationships are by no means expected to be permanent
This is only something I'm so critical of because I'm 21
it's not that it doens't feel like it is meant to be, I just don't have the passion for her that motivates me to put in the years of effort to refine the relationship
to put a depressed person with a narcissist
but it was just a very toxic relationship
Like I don't have commitment problems, I was super ready to spend the rest of my life with Megan
but Hannah and I just don't mesh well enough to justify it
because this sounds really bad
yikes, heres the thing because i haven't admited this to anyone
with Hannah she is literally flat broke
like Megan would buy me shit all the time because she was loaded, but there was never this sort of inbalancce, because she always knew i still had money
like she needs it way more than I do, but at the same time it breeds an unequal relationship
yeah it's also been eating up at my savings, which is fine but also not fine at the same time
I've bought her textbooks and food and shit before, which adds a layer of responsibility
like I don't pay for majority of anything, but there is this sort of unspoken agreement that I've got her back.
which isn't a problem for me, but makes me feel more guilty about if this doesn't work out
yeah, it just has definitly made things more complicated because I'm a soruce of security for her beyond just emotional now
not homelss super poor
"super poor" as in both her parents are unemployed and have no money
I also don't know if you know this but Hannah is like super poor, which has added an interesting dynamic to all of this
or if this relationship just isn't meant to work out
and I can't tell if it is for the reasons we've just talked about
We are together, and she seems fine, but I'm pretty unhappy
idk honestly
lol I'm literally Pip
Yeah I mean I grew up in a trailer park and had a mom that beat me, but I still feel that just because of my last 6-7 years of extreme privledge I've lost all ability to sort of relate.
Thanks grandpa
its just sort of a cosmic apathy that was instilled upon me.
So it is so easy for me to accept everything because that is the way I was taught, but not out of a thought that things aren't bad
But my life is filled with so much privledge that that perspective is something I can only have because of that privledge
Because I've been taught to take everything as the way it is, and all suffering and bliss as things that can only be accepted, which is fine and dandy.
See I have this dichotomy of my upbringing that makes that really difficult.
I mean most of what I study is all about the growing demand of media in China, and these are all the same concerns
And I also get that games and comics are very consumerist products that the people who maybe need them the most don't have access to, but I don't really see how my influence currently can change that.
like I know it comes from this place of escapism, but knowing that I could make peoples lives suck a little bit less through something I'm so passionate about is very inspiring
like going to comic con was nice because it was crazy seeing how many people would just stand in line for hours to meet someone who means something to them
because it is sort of this anon way of having a genuine connection
lol yeah, I get that too, but that's why I am so inspired by art
which I guess is part of existing as a human being, and I have to choose my posture towards that shit and whatever.
alone I am just sort of melancholic or complicitness as you mentioned, which is either elated or made even worse by authentic human interaction
I have an almost impossible time of not having people feed on my emotions, I take on the feelings of pretty much whatever anyone else is feeling, which is why it is exhausting for me to be around people genuinely
which is cynical, but something I nonetheless have trouble with.
if feeling bad about other peoples suffering doesn't help their suffering then I have a hard time justifying why it should feed at my own emotional energy
that's the escapism
See I'm crazy empathetic too, but because of that I don't like interacting with things
That's fair very legit, and probably a healthier perspective
which is why I like volunteering with kids
the only time i get that is with one on one stuff
It sounds apathetic, but nothing I see myself doing in the present gives me any sense of satisfaction that I am aiding anything.
in a way that takes my emotional and physical resources
I would honestly fucking hate it though if I felt any moral compulsion to care for the "public"
Yeah, it is just a different moral upbringing
See you have that much more ingrained in you than I do.
In my family it is all about philanthrophy, meaning reaching a point where your impact is most substantial before you really do anything, which is a very unhealthy perspective.
That has pretty much become my philosophy towards everything these days.
That the world is so fucking terrible that if i can do anything that isn't causing someone else harm that makes me happy, I shouldn't feel bad about doing it.
Like if my happiness doesn't come at the expense of anyone else, and my potential to create similar happiness for others isn't hindered, then there shouldn't be a problem.
from a larger perspective it is, but from a smaller one it is very problematic.
yeah, I just haven't been able to decide if that is good or not
where I would honestly rather be consuming anything than having majority of human interactions
because of my current trajectory
I've been thinking a lot about that recently
That's interesting
which is true most the time
I'd be so scared I was spending so much effort on something terrible
not to mention games and comics are much more of a collective project whereas "high art " and writing are isolated mediums
also serial writing that comes from comics is honestly a much more natural way of story telling that doesn't require as much emotional energy
whereas the current school of writing is all about creating something personal
I think because those two are such inherently commercial products
that doesn't come across as much as comics and games
yeah there seems to be a greater disconnect between the craft of books and the consumption
but you've had a very different relationship to books than I have
sort of like "high art"
I've never really been captured by that medium but more rather just see it as sort of an inspiration
i feel like it is hard to consume so many games and comics and tv and shit without wanting to be a part of it
which is why research is most valuable
but like your interest doesn't come from a subconscious desire to make headphones
yeah
but comics and video games it is sorta necesssary
but for things like cars it I feel like you can learn a lot without actually having to physically do anyhting
I like consuming because I feel like I am learning more about the medium that way
lol
I just like the consumer part
like i know some people do
because I don't like the research part of being a consumer
theres not comparing things against eachother because everything is so different
comics and games are nice because it is a 1 for 1
like computers and headphones are hard for me because their quality for me is a little abstract
yeah, I don't think I could ever be into anything I couldn't directly "consume"
I wish I could be more like ronald who literally consults his doctor anytime he spends more than 20 dollars
but I'm so fucking glad I didn't
I considered getting into toys
because that would be way too expensive
and luckily I have no interest in actual collectables
I really just want to limit myself to comics and games
yeah
I remember growing up and wondering why my dad had so many cds and dvds and I realize now he was jusst doing the same thing in his twenties that we are doing
and i can keep the rest
you can buy the headphones
where 500 is basically your subscription fee
unlike if you are into golf or tennis or cars
500 goes a long way
but thats so substanative in regards to videogames
like if I ever make 6 figures (which is doubtful) blowing 500 a month on video games would be negligable
where collecting shit in the 60-200 range will be like nothing
I'm just so excited to one day have a real job
lol
also to be fair I have been a customer there for seven years
but tbf I have stolen or "discounted" equally as much as I have boughten
and it is really embarassing for me
we updated the gameworld pos and now everytime you log in it has the alltime highest paying customers
if it was 120 maybe MAYBE i'd get one
virtual boys are 200 geez
hmm...how much is a virtualboy i wonder
because i'd be like "oh the kids need food?
well I just bought a virtua boy for $600 so yall need to go drink some coffee or something to curb your appetite"
god, this is why i can never have kids
lol
but then i remembered i have both of those games and an n64
so it felt like a deal at the time
it was 90 and comes with ocarina and starfox
I buy something stupid
I do this every finals
lol i just bought a japanese n64 off ebay
and if i didn't already have a wii
lol id totally go for it if they werent shit games
We disrespected her more than I think I have ever disrespected someone
God she hated us
Yeah.
I was just thinking thar
I love that there are inside jokes I don't even remember
Lol
Other than everything we haven't gotten a quality silly game in a while.
bossa hasn't made anything legit in a hot minute
how come we havent gotten a solid game like that in a while
I just realized that octodad, stanley parable, and jazzpunk all came out at like the same time
Horror game
persona 5 honestly reminds me of a dickens novel in how it is just perpetually introducing new characters and relations
though the high concept plot is way better in smta
also if you like the interpersonal stuff in smt it is like 5 times better in persona
i mean i'm lvl 60, i feel like its like pokemon where I could beat the game without ever needing to figure it out
lol
yeah i dont meet that requirement for any of them
i've just been randomly fusing
this is a lot
oh jesus
yeah that portal place was dumb af
because i literally don't have the requirements to make any of the complex fusions
is there anyway to get demons i never originally caught, other than having to go all the way back to where they are?
lol
also im on my way to fight merkabah
i wish you would hurry up and beat nier so you can play it
god persona is getting really good though
which is why nier is s tier
i mean pretty much every game these days has a stealth section except nier
once you get a lot of the dope powerups though it is awesome
lol
including like hidden levels and shit
it honestly progresses a lot like a mario game
it gets way better
i mean yeah i don't blame you
also asher did you see my gravity rush message?
<@!71716577669550080> it is literally a zelda mmo
CROSS PLATFORM
thats why ff14 is so great
my pc can't run it
nvm
üò¶
I'll totally rent it and play it with you this weekend
yeah i only got like an hour in but thougt it would be super cool if i had someone to play with
so all you need is like 20 hours in the game for it to pay off
until you start school and stop playing it anyway
you get a month free with purchase though mac, which will last you the summer
r6?
have yo played it yet asher?
yeah its an mmo

realms reborn has 9/10
realms reborn is even higher rated

Lol
<@!125452744440938497> makoto is my new waifu
Cool.
I'll boot up ff14
I wrote it in his backstory.
Clarence Onionfolk is used to be lonely
No big deal.
I'll just grind on some funguars
Tell me if someone awants to play ff14 later tonight.
lol i just finished this bullshit paper comparing my art to famous people

"are you a metal gear head"

Keenan May
Always yours,
Thanks!

Quote from hannah the other day "Mac is kinda a butt"
ill buy tetris once i finish this paper
üò¶
are we friends?
like on the 3ds
i can't remember
mac, does the switch have a registered friend system yet?
cool man
i got three pages left to go in this paper, this will be interesting
yeeeeeah
i'm innocent here
exactly
ashers
because we used my coffe grinder to grind the weed
if i didnt smoke i would have still be high today
no
its because i accidentaly had edibles with moring
it has nothing to do with because i smoked
nothing is scarier though than it just being the middle of the afternoon and just randomly getting high
so maybe
i mean i guess i am just writing a paper about art
üòé
fuck Idk how i'm going to finish my homework now
fucking coffee
i suddenly got high out of nowhere
<@!125452744440938497> exactly what i said was going to happen happened
Tell him I say hey
<:happyboy:230130509630406656>
Np
But I couldn't lie
But I didn't want to talk about it in the first place.
Which is very fair in her part
Basically what it comes down to is that I didn't see us being together forever and she was not cool with that
I'm at work.
How do you unfriend on discord?
Like why do you torture me by having your best character in only periphery games.
God
With waluigi a the protagonist.
All I want is a Nintendo dating sim
"The Nintendo franchise prides itself on its wide array of characters which is why we will never be disrespectful to any beloved franchises, so unfortunately we will never see a waluigi game"
Hey Nintendo I really like that you made this game about noodle arms and another about cutting your friends, do you think we will ever get a silly waluigi game?
Watch the video I sent to find out
First snipperclips and now this
Nintendo is just loosing their fucking minds.
That'll definitely stay in the E10 realm
What if it is a fucking horror dungeon with a bunch of his brothers trapped in giant test tubes.
Hey ryuji-San you know that new blob green guy we made right?
I'm trying to design a stage for him, any ideas?
üëè
ALSO HER HANDS A NOODLE DRAGON!
That's not enough we need more
She's a cool girl, with noodles for arms.
What if we had one of those but he was made out of sex jelly?
You know those wacky waving inflatable tube men right?
Like outside car dealerships?
Hey guys minmin went over real well with the fans we needs something good for our next character, komicho-san what do you have?
Find the arm boy
<:preciousboy:234377704261156865> <:preciousboy:234377704261156865> <:preciousboy:234377704261156865> <:armboy:307590740496875531> <:preciousboy:234377704261156865> <:preciousboy:234377704261156865> <:preciousboy:234377704261156865> <:preciousboy:234377704261156865>
2nd one?
üçÜ ü•ï <:armboy:307590740496875531>
<:armboy:307590740496875531> is new <:god:230133457630658562>
He is my new waifu
<:armboy:307590740496875531>
Why have you still not added him
:armboy:
Add
:armboy:
Lol
Make sure your sample size is large enough.
Can you make it an emoji please?
Icon=perfect
Except asher.
I have such a good network of friends that all like the shit I like, but bad when life shit happens
And the only person I've mentioned it to is you
Hannah's been talking with people all day
It's not that you aren't sensitive it just isn't in your ballpark.
lol that's nothing personal you know it's true though.
He is literally the only friend sensitive enough to talk about shit when I get bummed
I wish asher was online
Lol
It's okay bud.
You can just watch me twitch stream little nightmares
Lol
Is it just 20%
What do you get from the Amazon version?
mac you at least need to watch the last five minutes of this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U0blDjQ2Gg
helix is also 99% of the arms lore
yeah
k
you could always just hang in gameworld and play
lol
I know you really like mario kart, but still
which i feel like is how you feel
I mean I've pretty much been really bummed out all day
it's pretty much the same
idk
I'm pretty sure Hannah and I just broke up, so I get where you are coming from m'dude
üò¶
sorry bud
i think i'm going to min-max a conjurer arcanist build
arcanist = ranged magic dps
thaumaturge = range magic dps
conjurer = healing
rogue = melee dps
archer = ranged dps
lancer = dps melee
marauder = tank
pubilist = dps melee
gladiator = tank
so like a cleric (white mage) is like 15 levels thaumaturge 30 levels conjurer
classes are just sort of the skills you level up to reach proficiency
but that doesnt determine anything, it is the jobs that determines your skills and shit
marauder, gladiator, pugilist, lancer, archer, rogue, conjurer, thaumaturge, and arcanist
but then id be stealing your thunder mac
that way im useful
i'm thinking conjurer
what class should i be
nbd
judt 2dsxl
oh
link
just bought ffxiv
how far are you in nier?
hmm
I'm just so tired of paternal bonds
thick dad is also something i can be interested in
i see your point
alright
hmm
i want perfect twink boy nier
i don't want buff nier
that's all i care about
isnt it different character model for nier?
speaking of which, how have i never played terraway
anyway i love the idea of little big planet if it was a horror game
they already got the money
so you aren't a real consumer
you will buy it from steam sale
because you won't buy it from them
nah
well I, as the consumer, don't care
okay
so who really cares
maybe but they are like 3 hour games that are just beyond easy platformers
ln
but I really really like the aesthetic of lm
don't get me wrong
oh inside is super super good
also I've already played limbo and I'm way more interested in ln than inside
limbo, inside and little nightmares is like 3 minutes long
lol
I'll send you pic
don't worry
actually i havent decided if I'm buying little nightmares or mario kart yet
I'll have it before you
ha you suck
hmm
maybe this is my calling
are there any game parody sites?
shit
...
...
...
they are the best parody site
have you read any other of their stuff
lol I love clickhole
is their a fan translation of nier replicant?
asher
lol
if i would have seen that at c2e2 i would have bought it for you in a heartbeat
yeh
i am
im going to buy realms reborn
or you can just borrow all of mine
this is a good excuse to get into ff asher
and short
its just old
its a good game though
its 6 at gameworld
still worth it
come on you guys
realms reborn only 9.99
i have that one
lol holy shit
where
Lol
I know mac it's a little uncanny.
Is there a difference?
Either way, I need the kindness.
Asher I for sure want to hit you up for that dankness, my puritan ass was hesitant at first but Hannah's been riding my hog for the last 6 hours and it is "literally" driving me up the "wall"
Wip I call it "sonic and knuckles"
I just bought demonsouls.
Zzyzx my coworker may also be down.
Okay well I'd be down for just asher and I doing it while we get the other map running.
Just more dying.
Same amount.
We aren't doing limited resource on the big one, just harder to get resources.
Technically all minecraft maps we do are temporary
And different
Because it's fun
But this is temp Mac
Yeah
Map
Yeah but that'll be in our next ma
TBH the map looks like a temporary like two or three week long thing
Then you stop playing
The map looks p dope
Let's do it
I agree
Also i want to have citadel installed and make mobs be able to break blocks
Fuck yeah
And by rpg elements I just mean more weapons and armor and shit
With rpg elements.
I want to
We I want to do a fucking bonkers hard survival map
Asher
I love high sex
Gotcha
MAC
Why
Lol
Why
Lol
Why
Lol
Hannah I wanted to recently but never got around to it.
Gotta get that dope green puyo
Lol
Basically the switch physical copy you are just paying 10 for that keychain.
Which makes sense
The PS4 version is even cheaper
Whoa
You bought physical?
Mac are you jealous you can get the dope ass puyo puyo Tetris keychain?
What game should I get mac
Idk
I meant Tetris
Yeah dawg
Depends.
What time can you start?
Yeah I enjoyed ot
<@!125452744440938497> what did you think of that IPA?
Definitely lost a lot of its artistic integrity because of that.
Thanks it was p easy once I got the password.
i hacked in
yeah
dope thanks
is it maccookie69?
what is my computer password
hey mac
yeah i realized that earlier, I'm gonna install it on my pc later though so ill update the file then

I bought the game in case anyone wants to try it
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B65b1mro-oj_T2t2SEhqMGdCTVE/view?usp=sharing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=7&v=WaYBYA4AsHo
this game looks cool
http://gamejolt.com/games/bendy-and-the-ink-machine/231092
I thought I did
Coo coo coo
Oh well thats today.
I work also Wednesday and Friday.
5-9
Asher you should swing by game World sometime this week so I can give you your presents and cd
Fucking amazing.
Yeh
lol
Chip Zdarsky

Here
Thank you.
I forgot to grab some and I have a leaky nose.
Hey could you bring sr tissues?
Lol that's not the ossue
Jesus mac
Which isn't too bad but going to conventions is way more physically exhausting than you think it'd be

Go to bed

Persona aesthetic is so much fun to emulate

Roller coasters or no roller coasters
Mac this is how bands break up
As far  as rollercoaster, that should be a different map.
There are jet packs in industry craft Mac.
And each community project should be designing and building a functioning city.
Just mix industry craft with pams harvest with hunger overhaul on a custom map
Everything we are talking about is real
We will never modify the source file.
There is no need.
Lol omg ronald.
So you just either need a lot of coal or build power plants.
Yeah but once you get electric tools they are all generator based
God o with rct3 was multiplayer.
Lol
Also ronald.
We may install mods that make vanilla tools obsolete anyway
To get 3 diamond.
It takes like 20 minutes.
That's not true at all
Lol
No but we can have a mod that makes X-ray machines a real thing.
Because all I want to do I farm.
Or at least I should have full monopoly over it though.
I don't want farming automation.
So imperialism and trade is actually a thing.
Let's increase the village count
let's do it
Literally what they did in Tokyo
in a way that demands individual roles and project management
where we just work towards group goals
lets make a smaller version of civcraft
YES
i want to make renewable resources like plants and animals way more valuable than mineable resources
then there would still be limited resrouces but enough to be okay
it should be as large as the distance between macs old settlement and mine
map
island
we should construct our own map
we are real life super herpes
i ignore half of vanilla
learn at your own pace
plus even with mods you can just ignore them
yeah but you are a smart cookie
thats why i dont want to do it
limited resources society emulator
thats the point
and hunger overhaul
farming and tech
lets brain storm tomorrow
map
island
new map
we waited basically a year
island map
new map
island map
new map
island map
new map
you never sent it to me when i asked
that's okay
mods
mods
mods
its time for minecraft again
it is decided
guys
or i guess we call them "let's plays now"
dude in front of me is watching an undertale walkthrough
I promise I'll treat it like a little Japanese baby.
Dope thank you!
I can come pick it up tomorrow.
Well then I reckon you can probably beat it on the way there.
Uhhuh
Lol.
Then you'd feel like a real hero
Or...if you just has to be good enough at the game to do it without the mastersword.
Eh but an epic hero shouldn't be able to kill a giant beast in basically one hit.
It'll be so boring for you
No fun.
Your going to be so op for that fight.
Jesus
Good
Okay
But will you fight ganon after that?
I doubt you would have beaten botw by now anyway
Also Danielle panabaker is gonna be there.
I know how much you love her.
Lol you haven't even beaten botw yet
<@!125452744440938497> we miss you
Plus it's like a 4 hour long ost that I don't feel like taking up my memory.
I prefer to have the cd because my phone is already full.
#appreciate you.
Thanks bud
<@!125452744440938497> is there any way o could borrow that this weekend for the ride to Chicago or I could pay you to burn it for me?
Did your persona come with the ost?
I'll have to check it out
Better than mine: Asian cucks less than 40 miles away!
Nier automata dx
Lol they should have made the framerate part of the skills like the ui
Even at 60 fps
I still never know what's going on in nier
Eh
Framedropes are just temporary hardmodes.
That's why single player is superior.
Eh
I'm a purist.
Eh
But I still don't forgive you for forsaking poor shiho
Yeah you were playing on a toaster
Like
But you don't need a 900 dollar one for that.
I don't disagree having a gaming capable pc is nice.
Because you can get a bunch of steam games.
Like what?
Because I'm 6 years old
All I notice is colors and noise.
I'm so glad I love games but never notice graphics, framerate, or anything specs wise
Lol just play bayoneta
Did
Asher?
Just hook them up to both like I do
When asher doensnt play persona kamoshida wins.
I can't believe asher is going to play dota when there is persona.
That's my boy
Lol
Lol well don't let Thursday be extremely rare.
Except yesterday was also *extremely* rare
^^^
^me calling you out on your bullshit from earlier.
Yeah boi
I'm trying to delay doing the next one
i finished the palace and now I am just happy being a teen
gotcha
so far the best game of 2017 for me
I'm fucking enthralled
where you at?
<@!125452744440938497> have you had anytime to play persona yet?
Sexy grandpa design
Also sojiro reminds me so much of fujiwara
6 hours in
I finally got to a place where I can actually llay
This game is so fucking good though.
Boylove should be free
God.
That's pretty fucked.
It's 2017
I just want ryuji to fall in love with me
God damn Japanese.
That's dumb
<@!125452744440938497> do you know if you can have queer relationships in persona?
I just deleted it
lol that's what happens when you have porn bots follow you for 6 years
lol I didn't even know we had a twitter
It's still so strange to me that I'll be able to team up with all those gods at some point.
Nice.
I still haven't done a complex fusion yet.
No
Like I'm pretty sure odins voice is the voice of the volleyball coach.
And the voice actors.
I like the combat consistency.
Smt really helped with making playing persona easier
But luckily I had a utility that could lower it
Yeah.
I got pissed with that one sun god who kept increasing his magic attack
Nice.
Yeah I have a divine, support, and utility.
I also never need items.
It allows me to save my macca for demons
Yeah especially when I've got such good mp recovery
Strength.
I'm half way through smt
Lol
Nice.
Lol
lol
Yeah
Gotcha.
Asher where are you in persona
Could you imagine if it took 5 hours to get to level 5 in Pokemon?
Progress
<@!125452744440938497>  I just got the leblanc Arsene connection.
Lol 3:45 just unlocked fast travel
It's just a movie
Maybe that's why hannah likes it
But I love the characters and story
Everytime I get control of my character I get really exited but then I just walk my character five steps and then it's cutscenes for the next 30 minutes.
Persona
I'm about three hours in and haven't really gotten to play yet.
I really hope I can play the game at some point.
Yeah
So dynamic.
It is perfect.
I want to design a texting app like the one in persona.
It's the hardest thing for smart people to admit.
But the most important thing about all of this is having the wisdom to admit that you just can't have the knowledge.
I think he's only been thinking a lot about it because they attacked him.
Which is a decent strategy on their part tbh
First video game she's ever liked.
Even hannah likes it.
Also persona is really good.
So I refuse to believe roger is just trying to fulfill some romantic quest for knowledge the only way he can.
There are events almost every week that have facilitated discussions about these things.
He knows what he's doing so if he wants respect he shouldn't be doing this.
I mean maybe sure, but they also don't have to.
Just like roger doesn't have to be asking these questions.
That doesn't justify lashing out but it definitely justifies not having to submit yourself to every piece of discourse
I do it all the time.
And sometimes you can't help it and lash out.
They shouldn't feel like it is necessary to indulge every single person who wants to challenge them.
For everyone else it is their lives.
For roger this is contained.
It's unequal.
Most people are against discourse mac, most people are against having to devote effort into justifying something they have to justify every day.
That's pretty much the only way to be an asshole in this situation.
And listen.
I'm not.
Because he just needs to be quiet.
He cares more about his own understanding more.
Yeah but if he cared about these issues he would respect that his academic perspective needs to just shut the fuck up.
Because he isn't.
I can
THEY DONT NEED TO MAC!!!
So just because that's not the case in the liberal bubble for roger, doesn't mean he needs to fill that vacuum.
It is the louder screaming voice.
But the devils advocate is the majority.
Also another thing that's important is playing the "devils advocate" can be a fun little exercise when you aren't invested in anything.
It's not an objective science.
That's just how somethings work.
That doesn't make roger bad
It's just important to know that even if you mean well and are doing something perceivably productive it can be bad.
Reading to kill a mockingbird doesn't give me the right to tell black lives matter how to do their shit.
Lol
That's why this is difficult stuff mac.
About something you have no experience with?
Yes it actually is.
That's because he IS oppressing them
Mac
But also demonstrates a substantial lack of social intelligence
He's probably coming from a.
Good place
Yeah.
That's an asshole thing to do.
But not everyone has that option.
There are people trying to tackle this in a different way.
They are not
Also you are assuming that the people talking to roger are representative of this issue
The presence of protest is the resistance that's the point.
Go read about any protest.
My dude
Yikes.
Their perspectives shouldn't be limited or silenced just because it doesn't fit a constructive model.
The idea that everyone has the same time, resource and ability to tackle these issues in the ways you see fit
That's not fair mac.
That's coming from a perspective of accessibility that not everyone has
Even if the dude was a saint if enough people were protesting it demonstrates the schism between who pays for the university and who spends that money.
That's a very legitimate concern.
So what happens when people who pay tuition feel offended by what that money is spent on.
It's about how the university is supposedly an institution designed to support the interests of the people who support it.
Also the whole Murray thing is more about university politics that his actual politics.
Because the human experience is dynamic and the people who participate in it decide how it works.
Even if it doesn't fit the theory.
The anthropologist isn't invalidated but you have to respect the source of the culture.
It's the difference between some phd who has spent years reading about theory of some people and someone who is a member of that culture.
Think about it from the perspective of an anthropologist right?
And people can't accept that.
He doesn't get to say what's sexist.
He doesn't get to say what's racist.
Here's the thing though.
Think about it like an anthropologist mac
They are very real very visceral things that have academic discourse around them.
These are not academic things
It's not that they aren't allowed to understand, they just can't input themselves into things they don't belong in.
But that's not how it works.
Because in theory being knowledgeable makes you qualified to talk about something.
That's very hard for intellectuals to accept.
You can't just input yourself into any issue that your privilege allows you immunity from without accepting that you can't have an equal footing.
Because part of these politics is accepting the conceit that you can't understand it.
And trying to, especially in an academic way within the public sphere flaunts the fact that he doesn't need to know about these things (whether he means well or not)
If you do that, you should get shit down and be called a sexist.
Here's the thing.
Also another major thing is that he's setting the constraints for any argument he tackles without considering all the angles.
He is likes prompting emotional responses because it validates his logic.
If he actually wanted real discourse this would not be the platform he'd be using.
Basically trying to prompt academic discussion when you are aren't effected at all by any of it out of someone who is is 1) not fair to that individual and 2) is demonstrating a lack of respect for the other party promoting that your detached (what he calls open-minded) attitude is something to strive for.
Because that's some elitist bullshit that definitely makes me lose any respect for him.
Yikes.
lol roger is back at it.
You know I've seen it right?
Where are you in persona?
The Katamari guy
So i was reading about noby noby boy and I think it is maybe one of the greatest game ideas of all time
And peridots bow tie makes my day every time I see it.
My ideal queer couple.
But holy shit.
That episode.
I'm excited.
This season is dope
Yeah
No episode has made me that happy
Ever
That is my favorite episode.
I just watched the meepmorp episode
Holy shit asher.
It is more descriptive.
As opposed to ersb
I really like the pegi rating system.
But it is definitely more convenient I agree
As of the moment.
Although four player split screen is more realistic than four switches
Yeah I get yeah
4
Yeah that's sort of the idea of all the console multiplayer.
Split screen local coop has been around.
Yeah I was going to say.
What do you mean.
Local co-op?
Not really ideal for groping.
Considering the switch controllers are microscopic.
I don't understand how the boob stuff will work though
Perfect porn machine.
I'm telling you.
Nintendo switch controllers modded for vr
I mean it's not a stretch from milking a cow
I blame sam.
I've shockingly played a lot of xseed games
I know
Nintendos boobies technology.
Just to see how it feels.
Just for that
God.
I really want the game though.
Wow.
I was think it would at least take a year until we got rumble boobs
Whoa
I can barely write a fucking 10 page paper for school in a week.
Yeah I did it in a week nbd
It sounds like I'm playing clue.
Actually if it is mk8 it's wario on the sports bike at bowsers castle
Yoshi Rainbow road 150cc green shells only
Ronald you are so cute.
"I thought we were making a mural you guys"
lol
voreporn.biz
4chan
So are we going to see f8te of the furious tomorrow night?
you can keep IT
if you like your job
he said, Jay
president obama called me
so
AHH
god each one of these is gold
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq1Cb4WshFM
also
god
yeah dude definitely DIDNT have alzhemiers
just watch the set up on some of these
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN3z3eSVG7A
they are no reagan
I mean
fair
yeah....
lol was he even funny when he was in his prime?
Lol
That was one of the most rewarding jokes I've heard in a while.
I'm proud of you
Nice.
Because that was well crafted.
Asher did you take that from somewhere?
Lol
Lol
Tell him if he wants to ever learn about something to just type keywords into jstor like a real person.
What a man
Roger
lol
lol I love that I'm talking about roger in the abstract but he's probably in the same room as you right now mac.
^^^
He wants to learn but it's also clear he likes the attention.
Instead of prodding on a social platform for answers.
If he actually wanted to learn he would just read the countless theory on it
Yeah and that's pretty shitty tbh
^
Yeah formal debate structures are obnoxious in literally every setting including a formal debate.
God, I want to see Matt and shailey raise a child.
Because it comes off as superior.
He also comes off as a jackass when he's polite.
There is definitely a way to be polite without sounding like roger
Asher is canonically a better person than me.
That is persona 5 time
No
Ew
It's finally going to show the millennials what's what
I can't wait until cars 3 comes out
Goddamn millennials.
If only there was someway to get the facts without all these sjws am I right asher?
Lol poor little guy just wants to understand complex gender issues.
He's too dumb but sensitive.
Roger is the opposite of a troll
I was joking.
Right.
And didn't know what he was getting into.
Ignorant
Like I said
Because he's just ignorant and didn't know what he was getting into.
That's why it's funny
I know mac
Roger is such a fucking forum troll
"Wage gap doesn't exist" hey this guy makes some good points, anyone want to convince me otherwise though?
lol it's about time someone called him out on his bullshit
Through the grace of ronald he is always with us.
Ronald will not be there
I work 2-8
No
Ew
lol I haven't been the that class since the second week but some extra credit would be nice.
I wonder if I'd get extra credit
What is mucsc
The only thing good is the skins
Lol
k
but that is more like a platormer where you are water
fluidity is good though
no
but probably the best one that has ever existed
it was like a tilt game for the wii
i feel like if you paired the fluid dynamics with the hd rumble it could be crazy good
mercury revolution
do you know what game needs a remake on the switch
i've even played a lot of sports games
+1 credit
i secretly hang out with franternity guys and drink mountain dew
anyway I definitly play a broader range of games than I feel I get credit for
it makes games more fun for me
I like caring
nah
if it didn't ruin my life
i would
I just get addicted
I love mulitplayer minecraft
er
lol I just don't like competitive multiplay
black ops 3
I also played evolve when it cam eout
i mostly play battlefield at the store though
and mgs obviously
and battlefield
I own xenoverse 2
yeah
for about an hour lol
destiny 1
wakfu
which sucks
xenoverse
metal gear solid online
about 8 hours online
battlefield 1
fine
you know I have like at least 800 hours in the call of duty franchise right?
oh boy
just not for as long
I play more multiplayer games than you
hey
i am going to try it out when it comes out
actually
yeh
we can beat it
just come over
lol
‚ÄúOh you who believe, take not the Jews and the Christians as leaders/advisors.‚Äù
heres what the passage is
he isn't a good artist
nah
its the number of JUSTICE
what dont you get?
this is what the dude said after he got hella fired
Hello, Worlds‚Ä¶

My career is over now.
It‚Äôs the consequence what I did, and I take it.
Please no more mockery, debat, no more hate.
I hope all in peace.
In this last chance, I want to tell you the true meaning of the numbers, 212 and QS 5:51.
It is number of JUSTICE.
It is number of LOVE.
My love to Holy Qur‚Äôan‚Ä¶my love to the last prophet, the Messenger‚Ä¶my love to ALLAH, The One God.
My apologize for all the noise.
Good bye, May God bless you all.
I love all of you.

-Ardian Syaf-
you can't even buy it online
https://comicstore.marvel.com/X-Men-Gold-2017-1/digital-comic/44576
lol
bad drawing
the crazy thing though is that the artist admited all of this shit was true
and 212 is a reference to the 5:51 verse used earlier
I love comic readers
people think the "jewelry" is subliminal text for Jew
also there is this though
no, they were playing baseball

so apparently a muslim artist put a legit verse on the shirt of collosus which is used to justify anti-semetism
I hope that since it was pulled from shelves it goes up in value
I got it day one
did you guys here about the problematic issue of x-men?
the bullet hell stuff in nier is the easiest part so you are probably already prepared
lol
after playing nier i really wanted to get it
yeah
discipline, not temptation
its gonna take a lot of temptation to not buy stardew valley now that it is physical
he even bamfs
"hotline miami with x-men" i forgot where i saw it
lol i read that blip too
you got me
i'm not
nope
nice
platforming pro
nice
lol
bro
story
cool
animal crossing?
in 6 months persona 9 will be out
coocoocoo
did you finally get your ps4?
im so excited
I'm trying to finish the three papers I have due this week so i can play it
<@!125452744440938497> i got persona
?
Fair
Why don't you just borrow my copy?

There's also a 90% chance I'll go next year as well
Yeah.
Definitely fair.
Because I've already paid for the hotel and I'm not making Mac chip in so you wouldn't need to either.
Okay.
I tickets are 70 which would be the only cost, but I respect that.
Asher.
Were you interested in going to c2e2 with us at all?
Im for sure gonna leave at 7 now so if you want to come over at 7:30
Perfect thing to play in a store.
<@!125452744440938497> I've had emils song on loop at the store for the last hour.
I'm gonna try to get off around 7 if you want to start earlier
Lol.
Yeah.
If it takes to long for me to beat it though we may have to wait another time because I don't want to be "that guy"
Yeah.
Phil may come over but I'm sure he wouldn't mind chilling and watching me beat it.
What time are you thinking tomorrow?
I actually saw that before I knew who they were.
Yeah
I mean griffin has 4 podcast and like 5 YouTube series
I think it's funny that anytime someone brings up hacking, griffin immediately either references the matrix or snow crash
They are crazy
Lol they all do
And it's not just the beard
Travis reminds me so much of Ben
When he is genuine
His advice is the only advice I value though
Yeah he just strikes me has having a subpar but normal life.
In regards to what specifically?
Most the time.
Because Justin and griffin can be a little esoteric at times.
Yeah but I appreciate him because it broadens them
I love when they joke about the fourth brother though.
Except sometimes Travis.
They all like each others humor
Like it's not like one of them is awkward
It also helps that they are all funny
Yeah
They didn't really all bond like that until the oldest was almost 30
I mean to be fair though it definitely picked up in their adult life
Yeah
It makes me wish I had brothers.
God I love those boys
Yeah
We are going to be in trolls 2

<@!71716577669550080>
Lol dude there is an episode they put out last week where they all did edibles and talked about trolls 2
With his cute lil triforce tattoo
It's my boy
Omg

My favorite one.
I love those.
That's me
Fuck
Lol
I haven't.
lol ni
What do you mean.
Cuck
Lol
How close are you to finishing nier?
I'll pm you
My theory was partially correct.
Yeah
Oh aim
Aim
What do you mean.
It's not hard it just takes forever.
Because having to hack that tower all over again is kinda bullshit
Lol so I stopped after I lost during the 2nd
I mean the giant towers
<@!125452744440938497> how many of the resources things are there?
I love that the pods are probably the most intelligent beings.
I'm probably going to stop for the day pretty soon.
But I will beat it tomorrow
Ugh
Fuck this
Lol
Me
Do you know who can't delete their memories?
So I think I'm just going to die now
EVERYTHING
No no.
No.
Nononono
No
Yeh
Omg robot fight
Nier
This game is bonkers
EVERYTHING
This game has taken EVERYTHING FROM ME
1/4 hp
30 minutes of attacking it
Finally fucking found that pod
Yeah but I can't:-/
Because I have like no storage
That defeats the whole point of me upgrading to beat the boss
Lol fuck.
But I don't have access to them anymore
I really need a maintenance shop
I did but I don't have really enough to upgrade past 3
No one is talking to me at the resistance camp
Wait wtf.
Where can I go to upgrade?
I'm woefully unupgraded
Ugh
Is it in a chest?
Hmm
Where is that?
I just sort of suck at the overall combat
Yeh
So that boss fight in the desert is sort of bullshit
K
How do I know if I'm doing a perfect dodge?
What level were you the third playthrough?
Is overclock worth buying from Emil?
I just waited until I had my jump back before I made that one hop
Lol
I thought the rate it was going was location triggered
Lol does it actually kill you if it gets to 100?
Idk.
I didn't die
Like to the bridge?
What do you mean?
A2 looks so much better with short hair.
Oh...nines...
Mgsv and ffxv all has trailers for the second part of the game
I just realized that 9s is the only dude
Of games made in the last two years.
Yeah.
That's the third time I've played a game though that's done that
It really scared me.
With the tvs?
Yeah
Lol
I thought it was a yurha person at first.
Too
I saw that one yoo
I was glad you pointed it out to me though becuase I was scared that was just something I missed the first time.
Also yes I saw the ghost girls
I hate playing as 2b
I'm going to play it right now though.
Then I went to bed.
Yeah I got to the point where the yurha soldiers get hacked.
Okie dokie.
Also how long does ending c take <@!125452744440938497>
The copied city is one of the best video game settings in a while.
the entire game could take place in one level like katamari
i'd like it
that'd be neat
katamari style
what if there was a platformer that scaled with you
shit
getting the giant mushroom in new super mario was my favorite
there aren't enough big boy platformers
i just want more platformers where you play as a big boy
because you get smaller everytime you take damage
and the more damage you can take if you fuck up
but the bigger you are at the end the more points you get
but other elements hard
making some platforming easier
where the more coins to get the larger you get
i want a super meat boy-like platformer that uses katamari elements
for denying me the sumo platformer i crave
thanks bandai namco
but yeah
and melee
i mean thats sort of what the adventure mode is
best hp systems
smash, sonic, df
more games should go with it
its a good system
i forgot about that
oh yeah
out of any game
sonic for me still has the best health based system
although fallout 3 was close
but it would be to difficult to incorporate into 3d
i really wish more games would incorporate his hp system though
instead of going golfing on the weekends, he just programs dwarf physics
he's just a genius
and has no game making experience
toady does this as a hobby
and were actual game devs
it was because they did it full time
yeah, i didn't way it was because of the size
poor df
i genuinely love though that a game like minecraft can be inspired by df but fully formed before df is even a real game
and signed a contract that he remained creative director
if toady just fucking sold df to a larger company that could work on it full time it would become the best game ever made
one day
so it will
well df is in prealpha
dwarf fortress
yeah
also tropico
eh i mean things like sim city and df do it
i just feel like not enough games fuel my desire to create a fully functioning civilization
no learning curve
because those are games i have already mastered
I feel like i would really like that game, but 5 hours in i would just break down and play df or minecraft
lol
FUCK NOW I WANT TO PLAY MINECRAFT
I like the fog
also i usually play with render distance on low anyway
yeah but mods and online texture packs
shit
all this minecraft talk makes me want to play minecraft
i just feel like i would get frustrated and want to play real minecraft
without
i also have never played minecraft with wasd
but still
yeah no i get you
too many negatives
also i don't think my laptop running optifine isnt as good as the switch
because it's actual minecraft
but will be more fun
yeah
i get you
but still
and is more fun
which functions way better
laptops
i mean
yeah dude
because that is the only minecraft i will have bought in like 7 years now
is minecraft confirmed for switch yet?
does lego city have a multiplayer?
i just thought you meant switch games
probably sonic
depends on how much i like bayonetta 1
yeah i probably will
because eveyone says the gameplay is similar
im excited to play bayonetta after
you should really get nier mac
I get what you are throwing down
okay
i want it
shit remastered parapa
being a good couch coop in 2017 is just having couch coop
yeah i can
dk64 has a similar one
god that was bad
with the dog?
remember that arena rare multiplayer we played?
and their multiplayer
i mean that could be said with every non fps rare game
lol
yeah but i don't know why people expect anything more
that's like the point
they are arcade modes
they always suck
i'm sick of just lego and rl
but still
yeah
like how great it is to have a family friendly couch coop that isnt a nintendo game
i also think people are neglecting how important the local coop is
it is fun
also you get the demo for preordering
i also got persona
so it feels like a suprise
because by the time i get it i forgot i bought it
i like buying preorders
its out tuesday
for me
it is fun
I did
are you going to buy yl?
lol
the diversity of the play and pathos
i like it way more than i thought i would though because of that
because you keep your shit, like darksouls
each playthrough goes by faster as well
really dope stuff
but now it is a retro style bullet hell
like it was originally a primarily hack and slash rpg
which is real cool becuase each character has a different game style
because you play as different characters
but you don't need to do anything differently
the first five endings (the main ones) are done by replaying the main campaign
and i'm real excited to do the third
i just beat the second ending
I WANT TO GO HOME aNd PLAY NIER
god
besides the pc of course
yeah but for games the ps4 and switch are the winners
it is real weird
my dad collects tvs
when he gets a new one
my dad is going to give me his
that's fair, I'm really only interested in the 4k blu ray drive
really?
I feel like you could build a better pc for 400
because what kind of people want high performace but dont want to build a pc?
but if you aren't going to build a pc you might as well just get cool exclusives out of it
yeah
or the ps4 exclusives
the good games part
that's what i was going to say
lol
you gonna play "the halo"
you getting the xbox scorpio or wut
so mac
So I decided I'm going to print out a glossy photo of Jim Davis and have chip zdarsky sign it with love at c2e2
K.
Just making sure.
<@!125452744440938497> you've played system shock 2 right?
Sigh...yes
I don't think so
Autoheal and hacking is so op
Right.
I'm digging how much faster the second play through is.
<@!125452744440938497>  I ship 2b and 21o
I may go visit him
Hmmm
Where geographically
Where is he working?
Yeah I definitely think it would be an amazing experience for you
I'm sure you could find someone.
Cool
So would football
Considering the only engaging thing for me would be to hang with you guys.
Only way i would do it.
Definitely is a free activity.
There is no reason I should go
also yeah we are going to c2e2 friday, saturday, sunday, although I don't know if i will actually go on sunday yet
i got really bummed and had to stop playing for a bit
I feel so bad killing the singing robot the second time.
I have breakfast before I go and dinner after
That's why I just don't eat at c2e2
That's how they get you
Or music festival.
That's like super bowl price.
Yeah.
Because you don't realize who you know until you are actually there.
I think you will have more of a blast than you think you will
222
With a two bed room.
2 tickets, two day hotel price.
Package
It was part of a deal.
Which is why I got two
It wasnt
Two
If asher buys a ticket he can sleep in our hotel room.
And because I'm paying.
Or at least where the theme is the nerdom.
Also I feel like this will be the largest gathering of nerds you've ever been to
I mean, valve had a booth last year.
But they are to us.
Because game devs and Dota players aren't famous.
Or at least famous to nerds like us
There are so many famous people who just also hang out in cons
They just won't have booths
I guarantee you will see all three there
This
His is so much better than last year.
Ray mysterio jr
Yeh
My favorite luchador is going to be at c2e2
Omg mac
my fetish
this could have been my claim to fame
jeseeeeesus
FUCK
fuck
yeh
done in vr
its just an art exhibit
so there is a vr exhibit that this undergrad is putting on in the grunwald
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1maJZ0U8ULg
guys i found our speedrun claim to fame
The last part is kinda fucking bullshit
I do
Farthest I got is after the hacking.
I just have no heal items.
Having such a hard time with eve.
Sometimes you surprise me
Idk with you
Good
Mac are you going to get the joy con wheels?
Although I trust the games director which is all that matters
The game play looks traditional but it is being made by people I don't trust.
So it doesn't count.
I thought it was 2002 with sonic adventure 2: battle but that was a port
Sonic adventure 2
2001
Actually technically loger
This could be the first good 3D sonic game in like 15 years
I will
So yes
I like sonic adventure game play way more than I like traditional sonic gameplay
As it was meant to be
I'm gonna be so sad if sonic forces is bad
Neither is walnuts peanuts
Lol
They just should have cut it sooner
Filler for what?
Other than the pagies part the only part that is repeated is the chorus.
We don't want zombies in our lawn.
There's a zombie on your lawn x 1000000
The dolphin one is just fan service.
Expertly crafted lyrics
Classic
I have a screen door shield.
Road cones protect my head
It's so much dumber
The plants v zombies song?
Lyrics
Conkers
Also the cookers shit song
I love that song
The song from plants versus zombies
You know what video game song is worse than the both of them?
That isn't even in the game
It's a parody of a bad video game song mac
But it cuts on the beginning of the third.
I have the song memoriEd
3
I mean I agree
Lol
Dk donkey kong, donkey kong is here
Until they literally get killed at the end
Walnuts, peanuts, pineapple shells...
It's not any worse than the dk rap
So you can't blame it
Well the yl rap is constrained by having to fit into the verse structure of the dk rap
No
Lol
But it's a play on the donkey rap
It's so bad
Yukalale rap
Mac
Cool
Can we have a Mario kart release party?
Mac
That one was real easy but real good
It's not a problem except for the fucking kamikazes
Yeh
Bs
This god bot is such ba
I remember him
I feel so bad for all the little acolytes.
So good
Jesus the abandoned factory was just a clusterfuck
P dope
Just fought the giant axolotl
lol okay
You can just use my monitor
I do though yeah.
What are you going to do?
Mine.
I have beer and you hastsune miku
No but you are welcome to come over and watch us play zelda
asher you better beat nier quick before persona comes out
Fucking sucked
Yeah I had to fucking run from Ballantine to my car just now
I think it is a male only study

No p
Pee great
The tank was adorable
Yeah.
Cool concept.
This game is p great so far
Shit that Valkyrie boss battle was dope
this dude does a bunch of watercolors of nier characters
<@!125452744440938497> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeN4v3SNQgg

lol
like you specifically
<@!71716577669550080> when can you register for classes
everything
<@!125452744440938497>  have you checked out David O'reilly's new game?
People have been waiting way longer for majora 2
Lol
Years
There are like ten additional chapters to kh2 that have come out in the last 10 hears
Just not a direct 2 to 3
Because there have been additional stories added to kingdom hearts
That doesn't count.
Hl2 is 2004
Kh2 is 2005
Nope
Have people been waiting longer for kh3 than half life three?
Wait
That's even more confusing.
Jesus
Like no real work went into that game
I still can't believe basically a dos game became as successful as it did.
The little fuckers go ape shit about that game
That's what they've been played for a while
Five nights at Freddy's is on it's like fifth one
That's not true
How are children supposed to jdersntad this sht
How about 2.8
That's dumb
No
2.5.5?
Lol what do we call a remaster of 2.5?
That's just fucking bonkers
Lol
TBH though I have no idea what the fuck 2.8 is
Not just the remaster of 1
Because 1.5 sounds like it is a game between 1 and 2
Lol
But the number system always threw me off
Yeah.
I've always wanted to play
You know, in case you are in the mood for starting another 100+ hour square Enix franchise.
If you ever want to borrow it
I got that new kingdom hearts collection.
lol I was over half of today's sales
Not my Mac
Mac will have a slutty phase
Nah
That's miriam.
Freshman year for her
Like 4 years
lol I just realized that Miriam is literally marrying the man who took her virginity.
It is so fucking stylized
You can just borrow mine
Lol
You have a pc
Why
Lol
There you go
lol I'll be back in line 90 seconds
I'm not even home
I just have it sitting on my laptop in another room
Lol
There you go mac
it is downloading
brb
snake pass is out for switch?
wait
what is silvia gunner even doing
i dont get it
i appreciate that the game rewards you for dodging with an extra combo
did
i
yo
my first death
fuck
but hes so pretty
ugh
i love how it is in beat with the music
he just standing there voguing
why isnt the pretty boy machine attacking me
<@!125452744440938497>
asher
did not know that
lol oh
silent hill
that and sh2
mgs2 is definitly his magnum opus though
that would be awesome if you played it actually, because i didn't want to have to bother beating it on the ps3 in order to unlock all the extra stuff
even though it is way less contiunity heavy compared to 4 or 5
because i don't know how good it will be out of context
or watch some gameplay
although you should maybe read a synopsis of mgs1
but fucking dope
it is a quick one
cool
lol
both
2 is my favorite one
i have mgs2,3,4
and one psp one
i literally own every mg game now except the game boy one
all
especially when there is so much lore to go off of
and a lot of people could write a very good mg game
because kojimi is a brilliant, but he is also full of shit
sort of force awakens the mg franchise
and a team
my theory though mac is that if konami is smart they will just hire a expert writer
and just self destructed all his franchises
could you imagine if miyamoto just had a major falling out with nintendo lol
yeah it is unfortunate
which is why he was trying to bridge them
well he knew it was going to be his last
about fucking up the contiunity
there are theories about that yeah
but some of it is there, just disjointed
so the double length of the game i was championing is actually just filler of where all that story was supposed to go
but there was the whole konami kojimi thing
i learned that mgsv was supposed to go up to the beginning level of mg
like basically 2012 square enix started making good games again
after like a 5 year shitty period
square enix has been so on point recently
but then i will remember every couple months
i will
fuck
i just remembered that marvel square enix game is real
shit
also i love that you can sell your hud
like dmc or bayonetta
i wish there was more visable reward for combos though
yeah that's fair
because niers combos remind me a lot of dynasty warriors 8
i was thinking of it more in the hit stun system and combos
i guess i didnt realize that the map is a major part of a musou
yeah
maybe it changes
at least  in the first 90 minutes
nier is way more like dynasty warriors combat than gow
and nier is a musou basically with raiden combat
isnt nier combat also very inspired by drakengard>
they aren't in the same universe
3000 years tends to dimish any real lore connection
i feel like because nier is so far in the future it doesnt really matter though
k
is it like persona and smt?
no
i should watch evangelion
man
all platinum games are in the same universe
i also just got bayonetta for the ps3
okie dokie
dope dope dope
<@!125452744440938497> after you beat nier and if i like automata, can i borrow it?
i should beat nier first
although
want
i
if only i had a pc
askjdghlakjshgkjas
is it out yet
secret levels can be unlocked from those hub worlds though
i really dont
the only level you have to find is the boos
wait wut
in 64 there is only really one place you can go and do a specfic thing
it is just a lot of blank space
64's hub world is no actually large
there are so many levels in 64 and sunshine that are linear
also the main reason the camera is different is because galaxy was functioning with such a unique world system
with every fiber of my being
i guess i just disagree
but there is no way galaxy belongs with them
i agree that the world series is distinct
lol
if you exclude galaxy then you might as well say every mario game is in its own world and there are no mario sequels, except smb1&2 and galaxy 1&2
that doesnt get away from my point
or especially smb2
like the fact that you can tell me with a straight face that super mario bros 3 is a sequel to super mario bros but super mario galaxy isnt a sequel to 64 is bullshit
i just think whoever made that was full of shit, or really wanted galaxy to connect more with the mario world series
just like the slide worlds in sm64
that is just an early one
not in other levels in galaxy
and the bees
think of the dolphin planet
those exist in galaxy too
which are in galaxy
the only npcs in 64 are the toads
based off of the hub system as opposed to the progression unlocking
galaxy is even more like 64 than sunshine is
they are literally the same game designs
and each level has multiple stars
each game makes it so you need to reach a certain star count to reach certain areas
each game has a central hub
or 64?
have you played sunshine
lol
that you can get out of sequence
there are multiple stars per planet, just like sunshine
have you played galaxy?
lol wut
the difference in movesets between 64 and sunshine is way greater than sunshine and galaxy
64, sunshine and galaxy are all the same
that's bullshit
go uninstall your life
which contiunity in mario is not real
it is just contiunity based
also that map is just bullshit
sunshine?
do you see
....
stfu
nope
neither does super mario odyssey
sort of how super mario bros 5 is called super mario world 2
super mario 64 4: super mario galaxy 2
it so fucking is
it is
yes
super mario 64 ds
galaxy 2
ds
lol
that's cute
because anyone who owns a switch probably has it on their radar enough to just watch gameplay footage a week before launch
so no reason to do anything with arms then
yeah
so they will need to parade their library a bit
becase by the holiday season you will have people with the switch who arent up to date
no it isnt meant to sell sytems, you just want people to know about it
they don't need to start marketing that shit until the holiday season
guaranteed
because anyone who owns a switch knows about arms
no one gives a shit
and you can definitly get everything you need to know about the mechanics of a fighting game in a minute
2 how many characters have been confirmed?
stages dont matter
well 1
like actual competeitive analysis
there are so many in depth game play video mac
the 3ds is 6 years old
jesus
as in 4 days
well i guess we will find out soon
they usually announce them about two weeks in advance
i mean
for 2017
none have been confirmed though
don't they do that shit two weeks in advance?
also has there even been a april fools nintendo direct scheduled?
nvm
oh lol
the dlc adds that feature?
nintendo doesnt do that shit
nintendo doesnt fucking patch gameplay elements
the fucking features of botw
which is shady
yeah but didn't let anyone play
I still dont trust it
eh
just not ones that they develop
they drop games that they publish all the time
yeah except when they do
there has been no news about everoasis since last june
but mainly everoasis
actually two
one thing that proves it is fake
there is one thing
thats how you create a convincing lie
eh all leaks are
(maybe)
caves
look mac
except that one time that one dude called literally every single game at the switch special
only in the marvel universe
100 years old, 35 years old, 23 years old
there is still hope
maybe mac can catch up to him though
i mean he also graduated from harvard at 16, so i feel like i'm already behind
90's kid
what a fucking 90
"but when i was young"
23

professor x is 23 in x-men #1
also fun fact
which is a bullshit but fun way of justifying them having no excuse for how fucked up time is in the mu
and then people he knows well but isnt around all the time like peter parker are effected but to a lesser extentn
but he remains a child forever and effects time of everyone close to him based on that
like technology and normal people
so things outside of his spheres of influence go about in real time
but rather proportionate to him
so time in the marvel universe is not linear
basically it is actually canon that the marvel universe was destoryed and was resurected by the will of franklin
have you ever heard the franklin richards time theory?
lol
new canon, the marvel universe is actually just a dream of fin fang foom
this should be the god of the multiverse
because those have the best desings
rather than just living on on monster island
i wish kirby monsters were more incoporated into the cosmic universe
best kirby design
and the rest werent
yeah but to be fair all the celestials and galactus and shit were drawn by the dude who is literally considered the god of comics
but then stylizing it
and fucking it up
lol galactus was just kirby trying to draw samurai armor without reference
shit like this makes me so happy i don't read books
nvm
right
remember when galactus actually meant something?
yeah i mean that's been the way marvel has been since 1963
i mean most of the marvel universe is basically a more expansive version of how many angels fit on the head of a pin
but also very dumb
high concept comic stuff is so dope
yeah
because when you read something you immeaditely unabstract it or at least try to, but confining it to the visual medium forces you to be unable to understand it
I also think things like the gentry demonstrate how surrealist or abstract visual elements paired with linear story telling can make for a stronger high concept than just normal writing
like incorporating sound and music
but like morisson has shit that specifically can't be depicted in a visual medium to explore those concepts
although the dc source wall is such a powerful visual so idk
because he just abanodons a lot of it
that is why morrison's take on a lot of it is dope
and perez
both were pretty much created by kirby and simonson though, so it doesn't really make a difference
but dc has the monitors which are dumb
because marvel has the beyonders which are dumb
it is difficult as to whether dc's creation stuff is better or marvels
wut
the celestials are some of my favorite aspects of cosmic marvel
not an infinite amount
but to be fair christian god is only god of one universe
bold claim
all three are weak ass bitches
but dope
it is fucking incomprehsible
yeah no
yeah?
ez money
dragons
yeah, anyway
lol
the entire set is about 4k mon
because i just grinded dragon horns
but i basically have enough for the dark link set now
feeding off of their bodies
because you are basically a parasite on these poor dragons
plus it is way more fun in my opinion
so it makes more sense to just grind on those fuckers
and potions
i mean the thing about the dragons is that it works for a shit ton of rupees and mon
eh
nah that was put in there on purpose
it is a broken way of getting rupees
yeah
lol
because those dragons is some easy ass farm
i was wondering what you struggle was
yeah
they are just big dragons that fly around all day
no dude
farosh is literally always there at midnight
they have a route like every character
yup
it is set times
lol no
i did that a bunch of time in a row to get a shit ton of rupees
just go on the bridge and light a fire
which makes it easy
but you have the slow down time thing
right
what specfic aspect
also how are you having trouble getting the scale mac?
lol i mean im playing it right now
get good
nice
I was saving those for when i got bored
yeah i havent been to either yet
nice
is it the one in the top center or the one on the right?
i don't think so
is super advanced ancient robots
because that is like the whole point of blackreach
but then with the guardians with would have literally been skyrim
yeah
yeah
blackreach ruined caves
nintendo knew everyone was tired of that shit after skyrim
and maze
so is spiral
duh
tundra
tropical
swamp
snow, sand, grass, tress
12 is not that many
lol
it just has a more fucked up biome distribution
except minecraft is a little large than bloomington
and has pretty much every biome
i like how hyrule is about the size of bloomington
they are my favoirte creatures
have you seen a sand seal yet?
prince sidon is my favorite 7th gen pokemon
because i am so nostalgic for it already
i mainly want to just watch it again
awesome
so don't do it until friday
I want to see you do the yiga quest
said
i
like
or i guess while you are over
I have to see it
please do it while i'm over
i want you to do it while im over
I'll let you make you make your own choices
nvm
it definitly isn't worth it
eh
dkc:mgs
the yiga clan mission is literally mgs with bananas
you can help me get there friday
he sounds cool
im sure my opinion will change once i meet him
I haven't even found it yert
no i haven't
he is just unique
he's not bonkers
the old man and the yiga clan are the only memorable things that were like espeically bonkers though
yeah i agree
but the dialogue is amazing
I think they are pretty generic honestly
like how he flysin out of fucking no where just yelling
actually just everything with the old man
just the humorous elements at the old man's cabin
and what i felt was missing the whole game except during the very beginning
that shit is exactly what i love about zelda games
but the yiga clan will
the camel definitly wont
THEY GO APE FOR THAT SHIT
THEY FUCKING LOVE BANANAS
to my favorite part
so close
have you done the yiga?
that's my favorite one
nice
which
?
4
3
2
1
how many
like the four dudes
how many ancient weapons have you repossessed
wrong question
sorry
have you murdered
how many guardians
mac
üöô
wheels
they are just super heroes, with cars
i mean they are bad, but they entertaining
they aren't bad movies
stfu
i actually like those movies
guys..
f8te of the furious is the best name for a movie ever
dude shut the fuck up
just not the us
actually mac smash is numbered properlly in japan
along with the first two handheld ones
also the first three are just named after the console they are on
because after a while you need to help out your consumers
i mean i feel like that makes sense though
mass effect solid V: Adromeda the defnitive collection goty
they should have just pulled a kojima and called it mass effect solid
lol start your own publishing company
i just feel bad for that woman who is getting blamed for all the facial naimations
just story wise
i mena the thing though is mac is that you can't make a mass effect 4
its like is oblivion would have come out after skyrim
it seems to have actually regressed
but andromeda isnt even maintaining the status quo of the franchise
right
yeah, i agree
it was just a bunch of fantasy tropes assembled into a solid AAA game
i feel like that was why the witcher 3 did so well
yeah but it is expanisve
as far as all the compindium shit
the depth of the lore is rare for most AAA games even today
i mean it isnt the story though, it is the lore
especially not anymore
yeah
that i will never play
at least we have three great mass effect games
oh well
the fucking animiation
but the animation
yeh
i looks like it is from 2003 in regards to animation
in so many ways
yeah
im sure it is brutal
i havent seen it yet
to think i almost wanted it
these reviews on mass effect andromeda
lol mac
but I like the advantage/disadvantage system and already have dnd mechanics internalized
like i know there are other lighter ones
idk, ive been reading the 5th edition rulebook and it is super lightweight in my opinion
mayhaps we should consider a once a month 5th edition sesh or something
ive been shakin' for weeks
i want to dm so bad
I've been getting such a role playing craving recently <@&227443709560619010>
so it may be the trajectory for the next couple years
yeah the only reason you havent seen it happen is because this is such a new business model for them
like is done with higher profile exclusives like bayonetta 2 and bravely default
still though with other indie games that will come out in physical form it makes more sense for smaller companies to outsource to nintendo
i thought nicalis was developing and nintendo was publishing
I just checked
no you are right
i thought they were just developing the port
so nicalis is the third party developer in that scenario
they publish any 3rd party developers who they get sole right over, that's like part of the agreement
aren't
they are outsourcing that to nintendo, like i said
they are publishing that though
the indie games that are getting physical releases
that's what i mean
since nintendo basically pays all the publishing fees for them
and it wouldnt make sense for the indie games to do that
but nintendo probably made an agreement with bethesda
eh i see companies like ubisoft and platinum doing this
they are warner
warner never gives a shit
they dont give a shit
so
it probably saved them a lot of money in all honesty though
it is a huge ass game
yeah but
its a huge ass game
i mean
These swords are badass
I do about a mission every weekend
Almost
But no reason for the vicorian
Lol
Is there any plot reason as to why they all look like Victorian sex dolls?
She's got a good butt
I like the commander the most
Yes
Why am I so attracted to these robots
Thanks Wikipedia
They've been talking about it for like 5 years
Eh
Is because it fit with their joke of smb
The only reason they created a meat themed protagonist
That's the entire point
lol
What
And play zelda
So I can give you your gifts
We should have a Zelda party friday
Mac
Yeah.
You can't save which is a huge problem when there is a 50% chance of crashing
Which is where it keeps crashing.
Apparently the game doesn't even download until you beat the demo
Yeah I'm gonna see if I can get square Enix to reimburse game world though because their warranty says they will.
and the disc is brand new
and i looked online and other people were having the same problem
because it was having trouble loading and when I finally got it to play it had an error message after i beat the big robot
I think my copy of nier is defective
But better in the end
Yup
I didn't fail that course.
I just goofed on my math
Mac
Also max
I'm gonna try to play for an hour
Spoilers
Spoilers
lol i's all good you can pick it up anytime
He dead
Yeah.
That's not an improvement.
I doubt it though.
I honestly don't know
I had no idea Norma was Peggy Lipton
Holy fuck
They are so old
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlSpfIx3wIA
It has real mixed reviews
Asher have you heard of anima gate of memories
Lol
Yikes
start here
https://youtu.be/NAh9oLs67Cw?t=59m35s
like i love how he talks about his research
im going to plagerize this for a thesis
it doesn't loose content
going
like it just keeps
but it is art
lol
at least watch it at 1.5 times speed
mac you have to watch thte frist ten minutes of that video
but the one i sent is their greatest creation
it it genius
lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAh9oLs67Cw
I work so you can either come before or after
My comic erotica collection is getting quite substantial.
Yes actually
I'm excited to give you your presents mac
Stupid Japanese spelled it wrong though
Also I found it
Like a trumpet made out of a camcorder and some metal pipe
But it was actually cool they had this interactive room of instruments that were all made with old Sony tech
I did
And they were having a major tech exhibit
I went to the Sony building
Also mac
It was for a bar I went to
Yeah I'll find it
I was just talking about something else
Hence why he hasn't been on discord in a while
So he should have gotten him already.
I shipped it to Ronald from tokyo
No.
Which terrified me until I translated it
And the only English words are "young boys"
That is a sign that is a bunch of kanji
That I need to find
So I have this picture I took
<@!125452744440938497> you should come over sometime this week to borrow my PS3 and I can give you your present.
You can definitely borrow it anytime.
Also <@!125452744440938497> I have present for you.
Lol miriam just got engaged
Yeah this shit is everywhete


They didn't have any of the characters you really like though asher

Rare sightong




Manga
Like i have pictures to justify it so I'm not exaggerating but there was a store larger than our Barnes and nobles that just sold published slash fiction.
I've genuinely never seen stuff like this before.
I'm so excited to talk to you about all this shit asher.
lol I'll play when I get back



Holy shot
Oh my fuck everyone
Too soon
Temple had the triforce everywhere.

no problem ronald that's actually pretty cheap
Ronald what do you want?
A fish?
Sex stuff for asher.
Zelda and Pokemon stuff for Mac
What do you guys want from Japan?
so you should
well they have mangos
Mac have you been lurelin village
Statistically speaking.
More likely than not
Just on the street
What if I find Mario odyssey in Tokyo I.
Dope
Nvm
Isn't that what my pro controller is?
Oh wait
Yeh
Also Mac do you have a usbc I could borrow for Japan?
I'm so happy I finally have an excuse to use that Fannie pack
Cuz it is dope.
It literally has 3 pockets one the perfectly fits both joy cons and the other that fits a charger.
lol trust me I will when I get home.
Case
Do now I don't need a cade
My switch fits perfectly into my xmen Fannie pack
Oh my god.
I'm so happy
tonight
min-max those profits
time to sell boys
But that's okay
I won't get any lore
Yeah
I'll buy Tetris then
Awesome
Is the switch console locked?
I'm going to Japan next week
Oh fucj
And tetris
I would want dragon wueat
I just counted
11 actually
(About 10 more)
Japan got so many more launch titles than we did
What comes out next week
I wish there were more games.
I've never been happier.
Hannah actually told me not to play it without her today
You should really get snipperclips
The switch is pretty great
Who is pretty boring
Except impa
All the kids are psychopaths and all the adults are horny sadsacks
Everyone is batshit insane
Classic Zelda writing
Yeah
Idk
Mac have you met the Gorons yet?
I gotta stop playing and write a paper

I'm trying to find all the chickens there
Is twin peaks on Netflix
He's pumped
He's at a gig.
I talked to him about it last night
Which is a really cool way to capitalize on things that the player feels like should naturally happen
Also I don't know if you've noticed but all the korok puzzles are about restoring symmetry
And I just think the option to climb something should be a button
I'm talking about the whole game
It ruins the immersion when I'm rock climbing.
Basically what all previous Zelda games have had
Or coming into contact with anything you can climb triggers that climb
They why a certain percentage of your hit box is above a ledge or something you can just pull yourself up
Which is a dumb choice for them but whatever.
That and there is no collision grab
It literally is the only thing that ruins my immersion.
It sucks
I love the noises.
The voice acting sucks
They literally took the best mechanics from every game
Like I said
Yeah
Have you been struck by lighting yet?
Yeah
It has so much good loot
Shit I can't believe I didn't go here earlier
Nvm
If you find the shrine in kakriko let me ineo
I tried looking
But I don't see one
Becuase my shrine sensor is going off
Also how do I find the secret shrines?
That's the one I fought
Yeah
It was literally shadow of the collosus
Just one
üòï
Have you encountered the wandering bosses yet?
But a full extra ring of stanina
I have three hearts still
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah but it is smart because of you are like me and don't really want to dot eh puzzles.
It still makes it worth it because that's the only way to unlock a fast travel
Shrines are such a smart way of making eaypointd
Meat
But idk
Food
Also I got a puppy
The physics in this game is amazing
Yeah
But there could be multiple
It's right outside the stables
No
The ball maze
Have you done the pachinko one?
How many shrines have you beaten,
He's also my favorite character so far
He's right outside kakiriko
Yeah there is a big fat dude who takes them
That's awesome
Lol
Just now
I literally just got a blood moon
Holy shit Mac
I've also been in the hunt for a bear
It just bothers me not having a full map
I unlocked most the towers
Nice.
Nice
Mac where are you in botw

But it is hilarious
Unless you just dominate which is not fun
lol it's hard with two people
Mac hannah and I played like an hour of snipperclips
I'm sure all of them if I went to class
When the music kicks in
Holy shit
Rumble
Just beat botw
This ui is actually choice though.
Lol
Wtf nintendo
Also no headphone jack on the pro
Literally the first thing I did when I opened the game was lick it
Lol
Like they even have an after taste
Games taste really bad
Can cofirm
Omg
What can I say
Broke mine
Shit
It feels so nice.

Guess what
Ronald
Nice
2006
Get a plane
Like most 2 door Hondas
Civic
Scooter
A
Get
Ronald you should get a bike
Lol
Ronald why?
So Orisa is probably my new fav

I was just as shocked as you
It is cogsci
Oh you meant the slide
I woke up and then finished it in 30 minutes.
China
Also ronald I just fell asleep during a midterm.
I need to start saying this with everything.

What a ronald
Classic Ronald.
her style is real dope
https://twitter.com/scarriebarrie?lang=en
they hire illustrators
yeh
this is maybe my favorite picture ever
no reviews yet
wE wIll SEe
all in all better than i was expecting nintendo
12 switch 0/10
botw 10/10
where they look eachother dead in the eyes and try to shave themselves
that's the problem with making games that make assumptions that people will behave like they do in commercials
which is doubtful
assuming that the people playing actually perform
hopefully there will be a wario ware game in the next 2 years
is that it is just boring when you arent playing
i agree with their main point though
poor 12 switch
lol polygon gave 12 switch some shit reviews
still
bad reggie
reggie no
In January, Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime told CNET that the company was hoping to create a better online experience and that ‚Äúthere are no friend codes within what we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù
dead to me
http://www.polygon.com/2017/3/2/14788532/nintendo-switch-update-friend-code-friend-cap
6.5/10 game was great but tastes like garbage
way better than wii games
yo neo geo games are the shit
I am hoping to get one of those new nintendo systems
asher im going
party
Lol
Disney infinity dude
Which is where I get all mine
We take in amiibos too
Yeah of course
I just took all the ones I wanted
Some guy just traded these in

This is just outright theft
Before was shady shity
So I've finally have actually stolen from gameworld for the first tjne
Lol now I'm going to have to try one
I'm sure it is though.
No
You want me to get that for you mac?
As they should be
For offline llay
That you can swap out any time.
A steam service should work like marvel unlined where you stream everything but you can download 12 titles
And it pays for itself in a month.
I pay 60 for marvel unlimited
I'd pay 100 a year for a steam service
Considering Nintendo kinda is
Yeah.
Good stuff.
Hopefully it's competitors will catch on.
I know these things.
My dad works at nintendo
Mac
But I still have all the install data on my PS4
Because I don't have it anymore.
No I rented it from PlayStationnow
Oh the game?
Maybe.
Maybe i hacked
I don't know.
I just got bioshock infinite and played it offline
"On February 17, 2017, Sony announced it would discontinue PlayStation Now, on PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation TV, Sony Bravia televisions (modeled between 2013-15), Sony Blu-ray players and all Samsung televisions by August 15, 2017."
Life is crazy
So who knows.
So it is ps4 only
Except they just discontinued that I'm pretty sure
Although maybe the psnow rentals are different from the main sub service.
I've downloaded games and played them offline
I have it
It's not
Mac is such a Xbox guy
You can also download them.
PlayStation also has four times as many games and does allow things beyond just streaming
Almost all the games on the game pass though are 360
It's been around since launch.
Just look up PlayStation now
PlayStation has had this
Lol <@!71716577669550080> the frog is confirmed for blaster master 0

lol Greg capullo is such a dick.
He makes his inkers do all the work.

as in the dude who made the game made it because he hated how he couldnt effect rpg econonmies
it has the best economy out of any game
you can do it ronald
someone has been waiting to write that article though for years
lol this almost broke my brain
if you start now you can be good by the time they introduce multiplayer
which comes with a really nice 3d viewer
I would get the lazy newb pack
you need some initial mods for sure
lol
how is dwarf fortress ronald?
really gets me through some tough times
interesting
or do all my homework now adn play hzd at work
should i play final fantasy now and do all my homework at work
okay mac
yup
basically every movie franchise except harry potter
thats 90% of movies
lol ronald you just buy a ticket for fifty shades darker and sneak in
know our inside jokes
come on mac
now you can't see it
the remix makes sense
well
do you know anything about the plot yet?
other than walk around
or mine or do anything in that grid
and you cant build in a grid unless you have taken over the command block
so like the map is divided into a grid
and have command blocks to determine territory
i was thinking about doing this island map i found
?
i was thinking more of a risk thing
it is pretty neat
i already installed harvestcraft though
I actually think i had a really cool idea for it but i want to check to see if it is possible
i was working on it today
spacefox or gemset are also the best texture packs
<@!127535721857679362> also this is probably the best thing to start with http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Utility:Lazy_Newb_Pack
http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Utilities#Dwarf_Therapist_2
but ive never used it so i don't know how it works
this is always recomended for beginners
http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/?topic=39229.0
ronald
and pretty much stay in the entire time
and you just pick a plot to start out in
except df generates the entire world in advanced
like when you start a world in minecraft for the first time
that is the world parameters
it has the highest learning curve out of any game i know
that's okay
lol
just learn
to try to make them too perfect,
so don't get too attached
your first 20 civilizations will be slaughtered
also ronald
but they may be shit or drinking all the time so you gotta make sure there is a healthy competetive environment
like you can program certain dwarves to function as indivudal admins, managers and finance managers for your business
but you can actually make corporations
it has a way more complex economic system
ronald don't get frustrated
it's happening

<@&227443709560619010>  you see this shit?
just that twisted twisted outlook

Evolutionary Psychology: A Primer

Leda Cosmides & John Tooby
i fucking bursted out laughing
they fucking use Gary Larson as an example of a "twisted outlook"
"Making the natural seem strange is unnatural -- it requires the twisted outlook seen, for example, in Gary Larson cartoons."
im doing this reading for cogsci
omg mac
<@!127535721857679362> play df
because the game is only as good as how things are playing out in your head
and what you are seeing
because you need to narrate what is happening
because df lets plays are boring as fuck
lol I need to launch a youtube series
which is impossible
the only way he would play df is if i bought it for him
I don't think he ever listens
in df
we told him it is already a thing but better
ronald wants greater complexity in stardew valley
yeh

Zeldo Keenan Ronald pinned a message to this channel.
See all the pins.
Today at 9:17 PM

<@!71716577669550080>  play df
<@!127535721857679362> play df
I'll probably just do that
but then again since it is skyrim I could just hook it up to my tv
I just dont want to hook up my pc
thats not hard üòÉ
is it super immersive or can i play it at work?
yup, better hook up the ol' xbox one
lol apparently it is only for pc and xone though
mmm those are words i like
apparently it is available on console
lol
link?
that exactly where an early run should be
awesome
literally everything you are describing is much more attainabile in df
you need to play dwarf fortress
ronald
To put them on the website.
Yeah
It is national Pokemon day
I realized why all those videos went up
Lol mac
both are p easy
or megaman 2
mac just learn how to speedrun mario
it is very nice for practicing segmented runs
convienent yes
so saying it is "key" is dubious
almost all games that are speedrun dont have more than 3 save files
lol
like probably under an hour
i doubt it would be a very long speedrun
this is what i do instead of midterms
you need to watch this to learn mac
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNL8rdn00IU
i usually hate these but this song lends itself well to it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otc2SZAiJ0Y

post oot confirmed
"new goron city"
fuck
lol
lol
tonight
they remind me of something that plays right before or after a commercial though
they are all great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYiYxplLWUw
I wonder what they are planning on doing with them
they just came out with a bunch of these and released them all at once
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF9sdXh7ghU
is because if that does happen i want it
thats one of the main reasons that i havent gotten most the dlc
yeah
yeah i knew they were delaid but i didn't know until when
because i really want both
do you know if the bayoneta and cloud amiibos are planning on coming out this year?
also mac
<@!125452744440938497> ive been listening to a lot of larry fast the past couple of days
because im bored
im trying to learn how to use mcedit
i mean worst case scenario I can just steal someones switch
lol
ah
and it is dangerous to go alone
it will be dark
because wont you need a ride?
to see
but we could just admire your switch while I wait in line
I just know they make you get in the back of the line
i guess it couldn't hurt
fair
but i wont be able to get a switch
oh they are actually having that?
you want to wake up around 7 and check to see if anyone is there?
target opens at 8
who is the director?.
or do we have a different director?
did kondo do this?
just in case
and if no one is camping out I will go and wait until someone opens
im gonna swing around town before anything opens
i think i sort of want to play this game
i thought it was a virus
yeah
that battle theme
dude
this aint your pappi's zeldo
its a new era kids!
give me that dank rip
give it here
lol
hannah is confused
im still laughing
mac wtf get out

lol
amazon has a pretty good return policy on books though

looking up mgs shit did
no
and put them on there
or maybe i can get a really nice tool box for my art stuff
lol
probably behind the paper
i was thinking of actually putting it on my big drawing board thing
I want to put it on something that i will always use but that i wont break or upgrade
i don't really know yet
on redbubble
lol i just bought a bunch of stickers
most post game continues the campaign narrative
that literally only happens in pokemon
in anything we are talking about
well that doesn't happen
k
that doesn't happen
well
k
that's also not what happens in this
do you know the plot to broken steel?
...
and if broken steel was 40 hours
it is like ive broken steel was part of fallout 3 from the beginning
but it is narratively different
divide it like that
because games dont do that
it is disguising a long campaign
its not
and then the rest of the game was the post game
it's like if they rolled credits after you got the three amulets in oot
but you still have to finish the story
so techincally you beat the game
the end is just to make you think it is over
the post game is the campaign
above average
metal gear has an 80 hour long campaign length, that is long
i'm defensive about you being a dumbass about game length
you don't know what the fuck you are talking about
k
it is 80 without them
most open worlds dont have post games, and mgsv has side quests too
are you going to use xenoblade to judge an average open world campaign length?
but are you going to say that's normal?
k well you are missing about 20 hours
I would love to hear
other than witcher what open world game has 80 hours of campaign?
ive never played an open world game that does that
i think any non dlc post game material that literally doubles the game material is not normal
what open world game has a post game as long as its normal campaign?
lol no
not counting side missions
and 20 post game story missions
jesus there are 30 campaign missions in this game
art
I'd buy it
In smt dick and smt vag
I wish those two demons though were version exclusives
M for "must see that green penis"
For comic mischief
Rated e10
Into it
green penis is the mascot
and im so okay with it
this is a new level
and its the best escort mission ive ever done
where you have to rescue a bunch of kids
so mgs has this dope ass escort mission
i upgraded to a nokia lumia
nice
so clothes kill her
because her whole thing is that "she breathes through her skin"
i love it though becasuse hideo kojima came up with a bullshit excuse to get away with having a naked woman in his game
and im really scared its going to be spoiled for me
i have a fan theory though about her
thats actually a spoiler
stop
nvm i do
oh shit actually
dammit mac
i dont remember that
good times
i remember that cutscene
so sitting around all day in the sun takes a toll
to be fair though she is operating as a sniper in afghanistan
but those are her default
i mean you can give her clothes
lol yeah
do you mean does she always wear a bikini?
you have to make capture her which is really really hard
also shes not just a companion they give to you
shes actually a really cool character
well it is still amazing
whereas fallout did not
it won 2015 goty
but better
with boobs
a sniper
but ronald
idk i got both of them for 40
whereas phantom pain is 50 hours
it is an hour
also ground zero is just a demo of phantom pain
no
because of the plot
she is a sniper companion that is literally boone but a 1000x better
<@!127535721857679362> you should look up the quiet from mgsv
the art looks real neat
<@!125452744440938497> have you ever seen Ralph Bakshi's wizards?
Like a diglett with a goatee
See that could be anything though.
I'm pretty sure that's what kanji means anyway
It's basically just emojis
Fair.
Yeah it also helps when it is in English.
And confusing.
The subways are the same in Tokyo but just a lot more efficient.
That's the bullet train.
Including ai
Everyone says they are the most difficult subways in the world to navigate.
I'm so scared for the Tokyo subways
Nice
Where?
Not all Japanese people are 100 years old
That's racist Ronald
A really nice family friend of ours lives there, ai's mom, and she's like 100 years old so I may never get to see her again.
Visit family and tour stuff
During our spring break.
It's the only book I'm bringing to Japan.
And asher I will.
Okay good
I went back through On a bunch of the debate things and just posted my thoughts on them.
Did they delete all the shit I posted?
Ronald
Slippery slope
We could probably get it done in like 7-9 weeks.
We can just sort of set aside a general time to watch a few episodes every weekend.
Oh okay.
Well either way.
So really all you would be doing is making my month
And I'd be happy
I'd be laughing too
Nah
It's like 12 hours right?
I'm sure he'd be down for that.
And I've been wanting to for a while now.
We can even invite Ronald.
But for real though we should kick back sometime drink some beers and watch 80s action movies.
Let me join.
I play a mean support jug
Wait up asher.
All about that samurai lifestyle
Nice I love John carpenter
Yeah you should get it
Other than the dvd
Like what
Only 24 tracks...
seems legit
thats gross
lol so they just baked a cake with a mushroom mixed in
is that the cake that has a random cook time?
lol
street fighter turbo is the only street fighter i like
im so excited for usf2 by the way
and Armageddon has a punch em up
and also chess
that isnt that bad
i mean mortal kombat deception has a fucking kart racer
it is just a gimmick game mode
yeh
wow mac, just gonna leave ronald hanging
it's pretty underground though
it's pretty good if you get the chance to give it a listen
its called "Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze"
hold on ill have to check again
i get no respect
mac im listening to a pretty good soundtrack you should check it out
because I'm the only one who is perpetually on discord
I'm used to it
it's okay
because i would totally watch that with you
are you being serious?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_Plissken
i feel dumb for just learning this
<:sadboy:230133848740986891>
üò¶
i really dont like deus ex
which is why i always put off playing it
I thought mgs was going to be a lot like it
have you ever playted deus ex machina?
mac
I'm pretty sure that's a crime.
did you just commit a hack?
ronald....
ive almost beaten it
dishonored 2
you know what is a really good game though
but it is still real real good
and the supernatural shit is just people with powers
even the mechs are still basically people
which is one of the sad things about mgsv is that everything is essentially a human
rather than just it all being humans
along with an actual diversity of enemies and characters
yeah and really unique lore
its all about the world and the story
they always have been
but bethesda mechanics are nothing
i mean new vegas is in my top ten
also you can actually use psychological tactics which I fucking love
and you can plot harder missions better because you know the layout and dont have to do as much scouting
which is real nice because sometime you have to go back to locations you already did an easy mission at
where it uses your objective, enemy positioning and level design to create challenge
but the mgs solid series works like doom in progression
which is really boring
in bethesda games characters gain attack and hp
but what really does it for me is the difficulty scale
but that is just because horse mechanics are really hard
you get little mishaps on the horse
the fox engine is way more polished
and the variability in play style is also legit
mgsv doesnt have as rich of a world but its mechanics are solid
it was just the best at the time
skyrim has nothing
even though it is techincally forward chronologically
but it would really be hard to go backwards
but still fun regardless
just because it is really fun if you know the lore
I think it would if you played twin snakes first
hmm that is difficult
honestly mgsv is a better fallout game than fallout 4
which is why i compared them
also they came out the same year
to which it is by far the worst
but the most important thing in fallout is the story and map design
and has the best mechanics
it is just the best looking
oh by far no
the random face generation is even better in mgsv and you don't talk to anyone
which doesn't exist
as in 10 being my perfect game
relative to eachother
mgsv 8/10
btw fallout 4 6.5/10
although i am proud of the fact that i am still playing final fantasy 7
because my attention span doesn't exist
i just need lots of breaks
im very comfy where ever i am
nice
which is why im so good at playing games at work
for 5-10 minutes before i take a break and pace around my room for 5-10 minutes
i play videogames the same way I do homework
but now i just watch porn during class like everyone else
because i would play during class
i miss the days where portable consoles were really important to me
yeah
portable is my thing, there just arent enough games i like that lend itself to 5-minute spurts
If i use the switch outside it will be for like vacations
and i like the size way better
i rarely play my portable consoles in public enough as it is
because i would never play it
if i get a switch it is never leaving my house
I may get a psp though
but i probably wont buy one
i really only like the 3ds for mario and pokemon
its a real goodemulation machine and i hate playing jrpgs on the 3ds
which is more importnat
also is portable jrpgs
thats not true
i am real tempted to get a psp or vita
speaking of which
lol
<@!127535721857679362> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLO2-_emvDY&index=8&list=PL6bUG3k_rVOi98RQpugbVaPokHDglBmTd
Also I realized I look for hiding spots now when I walk into rooms.
I left it on yesterday while I was doing dishes
he can scout for me while i do recon
lol so much better than dogmeat
he has an eyepatch
this is dope
literally fallout
fuck
i just got a wolf
holy shit
keep them, never post them
lol
but it is definitly way harder to compare zelda maps than mgs maps
i bet nintendo will release an official map comparison once botw comes out
lol
because i havent been able to take advantage of the awesome combat mechanics in the game
im so excited for the zombie mgs game coming out
because they never felt like it
yeah i never realized how linear the earlier maps were
http://imgur.com/nrckIqr
here we go this is a lil better
because i cant find a full scan
well its a picture of a map so its the best i can do
thats just an image i got from online
but to be fair there is a lot of back tracking the previous games, and every room is a game element, whereas in phantom pain there is a lot of filler like any open world game
map size comparison

Usually not unless there is a specific demo station set up
before he was just a hateful, good artist/ writer
in which case he was replaced with a hateful old crazy man
up to the year 2000
people love frank
but there will be video game stations out all day
they havent posted the schedule yeyt
here you go mac
http://www.c2e2.com/The-Floor/Gaming/
as long as you are talking about stan lee
I do
yes asher
he is a turtle who is known for his racism
and he is doing a panel with stan lee where stan look 30 years younger than him
also <@!125452744440938497> turns out frank miller is going to be there
they just usually have a bunch going on
idk
if you want to sign up for it
there will probably be a game tournament going on
also mac
voice of solid snake
david hayter is going to be at c2e2 mac
shit
the ps4 version i mean
sounds legit then
k
apparently all the updates came out within a week onto console
it's one full game so it should be the same right?
where it is always behind
or is it like minecraft
also mac is the pc version same as the ps4 version
other than minecraft?
like what
lol imagining ronald play star dew is actually amazing to me
and hotline miami only because it is hyper violent
the only 2d game ronald can play is tetris
ronald doesnt like two dimensions
i.e.
games
*LITERALLY*
so literally everyone owns them
most of these are classic indie games that always go below 5 dollars on steam
yeah dude
yeah ronald it just gives you a steam code
?
so ronald can have it if he wants
although i kinda wanna get stardew for ps4
i'm refering to ronald
thank you
yes mac
because he already has most hte good ones
but honestly you should just take all of mac's games
like if you don't have more than 5 of them there is no reason not to get it
if i didn't already have more than half the games
i would 100% get it ronald
there is a minimum of 30 ronald

it has higher ratings than half of the main title games
also mac I found out they made a metal gear game for the gbc that is apparently amazing
thanks my dude
I got hannah a subscription to blue apron for valentines day
maybe
because it wont be a metal gear game, but just something that takes place in the same universe
also the next metal gear game is going to be so much fun I think
after i finish my thing on all the metal gears
which is a cheap way to bypass attack animations but still works
it has a unique omnidirectional attack
it doesnt have a one direction attack
to which I would never consider a game that doesn't a metroidvania
k but your whole point was that shantae is of the genre as hollow knight but hollow knight has better directional attacks
i mean yeah
eh
by definition
YESYESYES
ALSO YES IT DOES
i feel like we played too different games
....
i also disagree with the scale at which backtracking is necessary
not true
which makes it a platformer
but they didn't
probably
thats not different that getting the fire abilitiy in megaman to beat leafman
that's not metroidvania
but you have to backtrack to levels
or any game that has powerups
making it more like zelda
only certain abilities are required to make it through the story
that involve backtracking to get through the narrative, not to get collectibles
metroidvanias are one continous level
because you unlock the abilities to get new stuff in the levels
im just trying to parse out what you think is and isnt
ik
you do know that shovel kngiht is not a metroidvania right?
uhhuh
k
metroidvania....
shantae
....
yeah, that's kinda necessary in a metroidvania
like for a back attack, forward, down, air?
do you mean there is an animation for each direction?
as opposed to what?
...
but honestly hollow knight looks like it plays a lot more like super metroid
so i fell like hallow knight is trying to be more like the best castlevania game ever rather than darksouls
literally darksouls
from the level design to the sound and enemies
they are very similar to the artistic qualities of darksouls
you should
https://youtu.be/Nv34G5b-ty8?t=6m38s
have you ever played a castlevania?
metroidvanias are the metroidvanias of metroidvanias
that's cute
lol hallow knight?
nah its cool
but its not different than like majority of the music of the genre
it's a good song
k
lol
gerudo valley is not a crazy good song if you were to just listen to it on its own
video game music is on its own rarely exceptional
you have to beat the boss first to have that association so when you go back and listen to it, it means even more
that is because it has emotional connotation
yeah but havent you ever noticed that the music is still iconic even without just listening to it?
where i would just try my best to be good while i was playing and would someone remember a shit ton of stuff after i beat it
see  i just play games the same way i did when i was a kid
lol
I masturbate to the soundtrack on youtube on my owntime like a normal person
I also dont pause so i can masturbate while listening to the soundtrack
I role play
lol yeah but i dont stop every five second to check out rocks
it is part of your imerssion
You are deliberatly bad
I read dialogue
I don't skip cutscenes
lol, that's not true.
Just becuase i am better at them doesnt mean I'm doing them wrong
but for every hour i play is liek three of your hours
k
lol
thats the soonest i was able to get any copies
which will be about 2 weeks after launch
also i will be playing it once we get it into the store
so we will se
this is the first open world game youve ever been hyped for
and i have a more complete dex than you
I'm not even at 60 yet
a lot of time apparently
well that's just your fault then
yeah that was 40 hours
thats what you will do to botw after 30 hours
you arent as good at binging
i know how you do
so
because i will probably beat botw before you do
that's not fair
we both know that isnt true mac
i think out of all the mgs games it is the most accesible
but you should at least play twin snakes first
mac you should really get this game by the way
lol
where you could play as different skins of mario
did this
mac i wish mario did
can i have stardew valley?
mac
and completly ruin your imersion
im amazed at how early you can unlock this
Lol

in the comics they often come up with justifications for why batman was so dopey in the 60s and they are usually really funny
so lego batman is the same batman that fought heath ledger joker is the same one that had a surfing contest with the joker
which has never been done before
all of batman is canonical in lego batman
just the lego batman movie universe
they arent dictating the canon for the batman universe
i can't tell if you are fucking with me
...
because lego batman is the only way you could do that
thats the joke
the writers
so every batman movie is canon in the lego batman universe
which is hilarious
it is just everything is canon
there isn't
that would be bonkers
imagine if 66 batman was references in the dark knight
because that's really cool
how does that not make sense
right
how does that not make sense?
dont forget vehicles
becuase they only use photots from the trailer
not if you did what i did and just read the headers to each of the 15

I just ate an eight egg omlett and im still hungry
üò¶

mac I found a game hannah didn't hate
it is real good btw
no used though
yeah we have one new
no
IM SO EXCITED
FUCK
fuck i already found a secondhand store in tokyo that has super mario rpg for 200 yen
and numbers
and the game system
if you look at modern japanese box art
because most of the nitendo shit is in english
it is just a coincidence
that is just the kanji for super mario
...fuck
but it is JAPANESE
lol yeah
this is what im gonna get you

I'm really hoping i can find smb2 for less than 200 yen
and im going to buy a shit ton and give it to my family in kyoto for them to ship to me
but there are stores where you can buy just like a shit ton of classic famicom and sf games for like 100-500 yen
im gonna take a picture of the building though
me too
yeah
tokyo
there are armed guards with mario hats
its not open to the pulic
yeah but you can't do anything there
just kyoto for a day though to visit family
im going to tokyo and kyoto
I also budgeted for buying a famicom super famicom and ps2
Tokyo
Mac.
Look up game store warehouse japan
As in I'll be fine.
A lot
And that's not counting the pokecenter and the nintendo museum
4 different arcades
I've already plotted out 6 different game stores I'm going to
Lol
I never had that one
Fuck they have an oddish one
Now I'm out like 100 bucks
Well fuck
And would make them battle
I had like 30 of these

Holy shit I found it
Oh
Didn't I give you my gen iv guidebook?
Oh
They made one for gen 3?
That was a pokewalker before pokewalker
Along with that pikachu tamogachi they made
It was dope as hell
I'm so pissed I somehow lost it over the years.
I use to have the real pokedex they made for the 150
I realize now it was the equivalent of watching twitch streamers
When I was little I would go into stores and just read the guidebooks to games I didn't have or could play.
Because it's the guidebook to the most anticipated game of all time.
Especially nowadays
Guidebooks are rarely about actually guiding you through the game
Then it becomes even more rare
I mean they are collectors items
Lol
I bought it because it came with the official guide book
Yeah
Lol
So we can play when you come next.
I bought perfect dark for you
Also mac
But no one does the orb run anymore so it doesn't matter
The problem is that the end jump glitch ruined the any% run so now you can to classify it by levels
But there are still glitchless runs where the cloud and orb are banned
No the orb just gets you to the next room
You arent
No
O
It just amazes me how many times the "peak" was reached.
Eh I need to study
My body is ready
Also when are we going to get hardcore into rocket league.
Just a cool idea though.
Yeah I think it could have been done better
It's a game where you only have ten seconds of light in a neat dark level
It got mixed reviews but it is real pretty
You should look it up
Have you heard of candleman?
Mac
I almost cried:-)
I showed Hannahbthe balloons in mgsv and she was not amused.
But I will probably just go home and play mgsv
But PS4 remote downloading is real cool
I'm at breakfast right now
K it's downloading.
Is it free beta on the PS4?
Also have no interest in playing
Don't want to hook up my computer.
Ew yeah no
Will it be cross platform by the way?
Nah
Nah
Lol
Yeah dude of course
maybe http://www.mechanicalapple.com/
saw it
idk which
I put some sort of hollow knight trailer on the playlist this morning
idk my dude
but its going to be the best castlevania game to comeout since probably guacamelee
to put stuff on the gameworld page
i go on youtube everymoring
lol
ik
i have my dude
i imagine
yeah you would get real frustrated
im okay with her not liking them
i just want her to not hate them
ill see
hmm
like?
that was how mario 64 was designed
because there are no consequences early on
journey is just about fucking around
so that way even children can understand
yeah just buttons
that explains the controls to you
considering half the game is a tutoiral
definitly is not
just watching
yeah but she wasn't playing it
it is just a good visual experience
considering it doesn't play on any tropes
i definitly dont agree with tht
which is fair because their is no point
but she didn't get the point
i tried showing her journey
but was just them doing their best
which aren't great
i mean she's been mainly lookin at ps2 realisitc graphics
because it isn't a genre
which i told her that was like someone saying they don't like the way music sounds
because the other day she said she didn't like the way video games look
(rent both)
i mean i could easily do both
that's pretty solid actually
and pokemon
because that's all shes ever seen
because pretty much she just thinks games are metal gear solid
hmm both
if i could have hannah play any but just one game, what do you think it should be
you got me
lol right
lol wrong
which makes hideos way cooler
just an asian chibi that is like "hey i made pokemon"
not a fully rendered perfect masuda
he's just walking around your base
hideo put himself into mgsv
omg
lol
we all know how important those stealth missions are in zeldo
lol
pokeman
whu
or wait until nightfall to get better cover
so you can spend a whole day (24 minutes) scouting out a place
which is really cool
also mgs5 introduced time
and it was amazing
because it was very much designed to be a nod to silent hill 2
also the beginning scene made really upset that we will never get pt
it was my biggest pet peeve
also im so glad they got rid of snakes mullet in 5
because the mechanics and story are SO FUCKING GOOD
i just like the franchise a lot
nah
like if bethesda made a game in the engine they made mgsv it would be probably my favorite game ever
it's just broken
it just doesnt work
like any bethesda game with actual stealth
i wish there was an rpg with actual mgs mechanics
god
like my ideal game is 15 hour campaign 40 hours to completion
is it is designed for replayability/completion
that is what i like about metal gear solid
also the thing ive also realized mac is i would much rather prefer a game that has a 10 hour campaign but endless game play
in every mgs game they have to keep coming up with excuses for giving you a cardboard box
holy fuck, the explination for getting the cardboard box is brilliant in this one
it's not a belief i always had
where i realized shorter was good
no remember we had that conversation like a month ago
where i was able to beat like 3 games
that's what happened to me over break
but real real real good
4 is real silly, but 5 is real silly and real scary
it is fucking amazing though
becasue it is the only open world
yeah it is by far the longest in the franchise
like 40h
with a smaller map
its like witcher if it was a better game
and it so far isnt very canon heavy
you would actually like this game mac
fucking brilliant
i just got it
lol you can use the balloon in the campaign
also i was wrong mac
and I didnt even know the lore
because his level was so cool when i was a kid
i really want to play brawl again now
he has a box in brawl mac
of the recent game?
nope
like rings in sonic, or mushrooms in mario
thats like the trademark of the franchise
lol you always hide in boxes
Nah just a online stealth based fps
lol that's in mgso
Because the entire premise is rebuilding your merc group
Also the base building mechanics in mgsv are flawless
That's good
Allows me to parse out the game in my noggin
The concept of splitting nioh into missions is really nice.
They are Gorons have always been my favorite.
Never use
I love the idea of having a character creator that younger use
Actually I'm not playing as the character I designed so I don't know what's up
that dumb i want to play as snake
you just get plastic surgery
but you still play as snake...
mgsv has character creation
lol wtf
Yeah
Should I play nioh or mgsv?
Anyway I think I'll really like it
Yeah you do
In snake pass?
The idea of rattle and roll is a platformer whether you have to swallow enemies to get long enough to get to parts of the level
It's just like snake pass
Lol no
Both snake games.
So yeah it is in the same franchise
And it is the exact smae
Actually I just looked up snake pass gameplay
Since Nintendo owns both
For old franchises to be rebooted with new teams.
Yeah but that's not uncommon
Probably
Yeah it has to be the successor to rattle and roll
I'm hoping it is because I love that game
Since wise did that too
I wonder if it is at all related to snake rattle and roll
Hey Mac so you know snake pass?
Nicw
Yeah didn't they make ftl on iOS?
This could be such a good iOS game
snake?
it is adorable
you are right
no
https://i.imgur.com/Cf485rC.gifv
best time for me to start
exactly
Dark Moon
now that it is over I thought you and i could start playing
?
Dark Moon?
ah
are they all in different buildings?
you dont walk between classes?
or at work
I play when I walk to calss
mac where are you in fe?
no one just makes a salad that's just lettuce
that's if it is just lettuce mac
that's pretty much my normal diet
lol
but im just half assing everything
yeah same
too many gen ed classes
but i couldnt do it this semester
i did that last semester and it was great
which is why i can't care about any of this shit unless i actually like it
is because me goofing off is actually more liekly to benefit me in the long term than actually devoting myself to my work
see thats the biggest problem ronald
darkest dungeon is half off btw
lol
but I'm not actually learning or prepared
or a's
and still be making all b's
and like the problem is that I can get away with only doing an hour of work a day
I'm fine once i get momentum
i cant star though whcih is the problem
i can never do homework and games at the same time
Same
mmm
but I keep telling myself to do shit and not doing it
I mean I haven't missed anything yet
and i am way less busy this semester as far as schoolwork goes which I think is making me drop my guard
see even when I'm not playing video games I can't focus
I literally have lost all ability to focus in the last 3 months
how do you guys focus?
or just wait a month
g4u
Because you are the only person in the united states looking for new wiiu that is not a collector
I love you ronald
i still laugh about that sometimes
lol
what makes you say that m'dude?
..............
...........
......
...
said no one ever
lol
fuck off ronald
and still published by koei
it's made by all the same people
fine if it helps your semantics nioh is the spiritual successor
that was made before they decided to just go with a dark souls clone
it is basically the spiritual predecessor to nioh
also have you ever heard of toukiden?
because it plays a lot like ninja gaiden
yeah, it makes sense that it is team ninja
that's because they didnt make it
lol
lol you know cloud, with the white hair
blond
"blondish"
also his hair isnt white
and it looks real good
somone actually already made him in darksouls 3
darksouls you can have white hair:)
i think they are both equally dark
lol
and nioh is no where near the level design
only because darksouls architecture is like my favorite part
that's baffling to me
lol
but it also isnt worse
it definitly isnt better
lol
why?
why?
and if you can balance these in combat it is real cool
hi does more damage but costs more stamina and makes you slower, low is less damage but you can get in and out quickly
because you have a hi-mid-and low positions that you can switch between with any weapon seamlessly
it also has amazing fighting mechanics
yeah I was really low level so my stratedgy was to just get everyones stamina down and take advantage of it
that if you mess up you actually feel all out of sych with the battle
so it creates this amazing rhythm to the combat
where if you press this button right at the right time after an attack it replinishes your stamina
but mac there is this genius mechanic
so true
lol
like most ds stuff
dark souls but more japanese
the game is honestly bette rthan I was expecting
lol
It is so fucking good
I skipped school today to just play nioh
lol
pokemon?
Just about an hour.
Fuck.
Nioh is great.
I just did it.
I didn't know about it
That's awesome
Fuck ywah
I was mistaken when I thought I had her before, but now I actually have her!
I actually got Camilla!
Which is 4
I just got sheena though
I have 3 stars
I've been keeping them updated.
I know where it's at
Which wasn't working so well
I was trying to grind in the campaign
Nice
Oh shit
I also need a healer
And the rest can't do any
I have one character that can do 4 damage to him
The big ol knight boy
Chapter 5:3
Yeah
I can't do damage to this one guy
Serious good
How do I get good
Mac
Lol
Serious
Ronald fucking respond
It's the spin off of serious sam
But serious Ronald you should check it out
lol that's not why.
That makes me really sad because it was a better comic book store than ours.
Lol
So you may be able to buy a box of comics off of them for like $20 bucks that'd I'd buy from you.
Because they had a lot of good backissues
Ronald you should actually check it out
That's so sad
I bought comics there
Oh no
Lol im stuck in fe
lol
<:curse:248225815005757442>
way to join late
lol mac already made that joke m'dude
dancer
I got the most important word right
it was hard
because it was just a remake of zelda 1 so you have full up, left, right, down controls
more like night of the cryptodancer
sort of
where i was playing an autorun zelda game
Mac I had a dream last night
these intros are crazy
SARA LEE
the english phrase comes from the spanish though
<:boobies:232323564764659713>
lol
but why were you looing it up?
yeah
<@!127535721857679362> what the fuck is bimbo bakeries?
they did such a bad job at it too
lol





definitly over a dozen
I'm shocked at how many of those people I know
lol
way to play this all house of cards like
nothing
it is like daredevil but with more superpowers
is iron fist out already?
hate it when that happens
üò¶
whoops
lol
oh
mac this is real nice to have
https://appadvice.com/app/hypedrive-entertainment-release/836337140
what an asshole
lol
That's just an assembly line
yeah
like he is just like "here are some ideas these dumbasses have"
yeah which he doesn't go into any detail about
because the ruleset, the symbols and the computing power (the man) all exist within the room
is viewing the man as a mechanism and how changing the perspecitve creates understanding
which I found real interesting
but the room does
one argument to his idea that he adresses is that the man doesn't know chinese
I just didn't know because he is obviously more qualified than I am so I thought I may just be dumb and missing someting
yeah i appreciate you clearing that up
is because it has a lot of flaws
which i why i think i didn't get the whole chinese room thing
I definitly agree with you
is assigning an existential value to the symbols
actually thats a real good point mac
yeah he was also asserting that human thought exists naturally in language
but doesnt having the code to translate the symbols create the potential for meaning?
I get that the subject in the chinese room doesn't know the symbols
but how does the chinese rooms and the magnet room specifically show that
i get that
right
which his arguement seems very flawed but o well
other than just proving the difference between semanitcs and meaning
because I don't understand what searle is trying to achieve by it
without exploring its legitimacy
he just shuts down shit
it was only 6 pages
i did
he seems really bullheaded
I actually agree with you
k
mac
could you explain the chinese room to me like I'm five
hey mac
unless you beat the game the very first day you are going to be suceptible to spoilers
I never get it with spoilers
lol
yes
because they have learned
that and re7
im so excited to play it
lol
lol apparently the tutorial of nioh is estimated to take at least 3-5 hours
true.
Only time will tell
ive seen many "special editions" in my life
doubtful
Imma laugh five years from now when I have all that shit too
lol
and I am close to having all the games
so far I have spent less than 100 dollars on the metal gear series
lol
so i need to cool down
but i bought both nioh and mtgscollection today
I will
look at that doh
yeah but like mmm
ill definitly get it on ps4 but I hadnt seen any real images of it
oh my fuck
I didn't realize how good dragon quest looks
OMG <@!71716577669550080>

yeh
I love lilina
omg
lol
lol
roy is so cute
thats way more forgiving than normal fe
gotcha
ah
what happens when you loose?
have you lost a round yet?
but he plays it so cool
I love virion because he sucks
yeah shes pretty cool
I love my anime children though
im on the 3rd
like 10
nice
what levels are most of your anime children?
nice
how far are you?
good
also have you been playing any more of fe?
it's worse than the avengers trailer
i put that on the gw facebook page
lol
a bald mario without a hat
but that's basically mario
lol a bulbous nose could be neat
lol thats most of it
diglett face is just one punch man
but that isnt a cliche
something that has an iconography
and I was think a mask or helmet of some sort
I'm designing a character
mac what do you think is a cool face design element that isnt a cliche
ah
then why'd youd need to know
because I don't usually go
let me know if you are going to show up
?
thats just lecture
woodburn 100
tuedays and thursdays i mean
mmm idk
woodburn
mmm tuesdays and wednesdays 4-4:50
gotcha
is that it though?
does ibm even do anything anymore?
üò¶
that is pretty underground shit
its not like that is like the most basic piece of knowledge
lol did you know that mac?
I bet you didn't
crazy
like the same time as deepblue
I thought it was like from the 90s
i didn't realize watson was so new
that's based off of a cartoon
lol
rocket power?
because I had that for the gba as well
was it not tonyhawk?
I played sims urbz
lol
So there was so much hype the first time I played it
nice yeah I got that game a year before I got a gba
frogger adventures?
if you played those shitty games in the past, it makes it easier to come back to them
but the nice thing about that is muscle memory
yeah
you didnt have the priledge of being 5 years old and being able to play any game you wanted for how long you wanted
before you had parents or no cash
I think its because you werent allowed full access to games until these last 5 years
but it still happens
but now unless a game really appeals to be it is rare that a game under 70% stays in my memory
for instance I could play shit games like toy story 2 and think they were the best thing ever
I just found it easier to appreciate things when I was young than now
I think if you want to appreciate perfect dark you could equally appreciate if it came out today or if you played it when you are young
that's about how many I haven't played on that list
of course you will be into playing the classics from 15 years from now
Lol you are just making a bet that you will do what you are supposed to do
that I will always have in my mind as good games no matter how they hold up down the years
there are a lot of games I play now that don't do well that I love
thats not true
that you would never find if you did it retroactively
because you may really love a title that doesn't do too well
the thing i love about playing games as they come out is you get to play all the shitty games that everyone will forget about
also the thing about that mac is that you will only go back and play the hits
which ill admit is subjective
All I have to go off of is my enjoyment of games and a child and my enjoyment of games now
I think we just disagree then
k
also you have so much more time to play games when you are 8
if you just play them as an adult they are just pretty much one and done
for different reasons
I can play them again at any age and still appreciate them
because I played those games when I was 8
because heres the kicker mac
i think perhaps you woudln't pick up on the subtle things, but overall your experience would be more pure
i disagree
because you are 100% immersed
yeah as in being 8 is better than being 20
my best friend in elementary and i woudl only play perfect dark and smash
or if you were just the age i was when I played these games
so yeah that is where the appeal comes from, not the actual gameplay
nope golden eye was first which makes perfect dark also first
unless unreal tournament came before
i think it was the first game to have capture the flag team deathmatch
nice
so it won't be a big deal to you unless you are doing it for history pusposes
but you've been spoiled by games that have built upon it
and the multiplayer is really really good
is the idea of a multiplayer fps
literally that was what made it crazy popular
what made it genius is multiplayer
unless you pair it with nostalgia
but that genius doesnt hold up
there is
also the mutliplayer is the main thing for golden eye
which I didn't think was your style
and just shooting enemies in a room
just because even if you got past the terible graphics and mechanics, it is still a straight up fps
the problem with it though is i feel like both of those games would be really hard for you to get into
yeah
but now the mechanics are unusable
even though perfect dark has a pretty good story
or the story
not like the immersion of the levels
which were groundbreaking
because the things that made the game fun at the time was its mechanics
unless you mod them heavily
but they are unfortunately unplayable
yup
it is except for one thing
for the entire week
I just do all my homework on sundays now
I've been getting in like 10-12 a week
yeah
it is great
monday I start late and finish early
I dont have class until 11
I woke up at 7
I woke up this morning and played an hour each of metroid prime, ff7 and zone of the enders
lol
I would get nauseous watching you play
its an fps
why we?
I've already begun
we?
so there is no reason for him to play them
like all the way through
he's also watched me play a lot of video games
im so happy mgs2 and 3 made the list
yup
considering what it is
probably the best
that's on the list
he's played minecraft
like I can see him playing a tenth of them maybe
I really can't see ronald liking most of these games
lol its like me with mgs5
pretty mixed

bioshock was though
which I can't see ronald doing
I mean a lot of the non fps action games on this list are either games that you would have to have a nostalgic factor to fully appreciate or are rpgs
he's also played halo
well he has played bioshock 1 and infinite
also he's played through the batman games I think
no
yeah
and thats on the list
hes played hotline though
there are plenty of super violent games but most are hard
and super violent
because the thing about bethesda games is that they are immersive, but also crazy easy
to be fair though I can't see ronald liking a lot of these games
doesn't he ahve an xbox now though?
üò¶
because ronald could like that
is rdr for pc?
lol
I'm suprised that is on here
lol I've actually played shenmue
how many have you played mac?
Solid sex scene
It's a brothel in ff7 and it's fucking hilarious.
Inn
In
You gotta look up gameplay of the honey bee in
Lol mac
I've also discovered that ff games are the best to play while I'm cleaning.
Which made it hard to port it to xbox360 and psp
Is 2 and 3 utilized the pressure sensitive controls a shit ton.
I was reading the Wikipedia page for the mgshd collection and that was a major probables with porting it
Ik
Just interesting.
And Xbox didn't implement that until Xbox one
The x triangle square circle were all pressure sensitive
No
It's amazing that the ps2 had pressure sensitive buttons but the xbox360 didn't.
So good
Nice
Idk like an hour
The composer is like a legit dude
I think that will have an amazing soundtrack
Excited to play that
Yeah.
And nioh comes out next week
The songs with lyrics suck but the rest is real cool
Mac you should add zone of the Enders ost to your list of stuff to listen to
Snake eater is such a hype song though.
There is a boss battle in 4 where it literally seamlessly merges into the main theme from each game
Along with introducing the old snake theme which makes me want to cry every time I hear it
Because it incorporates 1,2 and 3
But then again 4 could be considered better
Yeah 3 has an amazing sound track
And I will have to see how 5 fits in there
So far it goes 4,2,1,3 for me
Yeah I will see.
The ending to mgs4 was almost terrible but then kojima made it funking amazing if you stick around for the post credits.
I was so very wrong.
Is
I didn't realize how legit phantom pain was
I had no emotional connection.
I was only going off of what I heard about ground zero
It was so beautiful.
Also Mac I cried booting up mgsv
He returned super monkey ball and ssx tricky
No he did
I said maybe he just didn't have the right updatte
He insisted he read somewhere that gc games could work with xbox one

Some dude just tried to return a game because it didn't work in his Xbox one.
Nice
Nice
What's part of it?

Rango
It's just the hair
Also guck that Ronald Freddy Lounds is the most fucking gorgeous woman on this planet.
that I'm trying to work on
that is a huge problem for me
Like no joke
this guy is me
women will finally accept me for the hardcore gamer I am
lol finally
gotta replinish that stamina
literally smt
wut
lol
this is going to drain so much o fmy battery
lol i gotta delete some shit to make room
and lucille
like roy, marth, and robin
cuz i got all the goodies
hmm
with purple hair
she's the big breasted woman
you sure?
I'm into her
Camilla
These stats are legit though.
Lol
Wtf
Ronald
Jesus
This game is actually p smooth
It does
I just downloaded it
Mac play fe with me
Yeah
And it's not written by the same dude
It's just the third one
It's not a remake m'dude
Lol no
Lol
Browsing?
But specifically that game
Also <@!125452744440938497> I think you would really like tales of besaria
Because it makes me real sleepy
I play ff though every night before bed
Also I like ff but I don't like how none of the enemies have descriptions in game
So no need to buy
Which are both part of the Kirby collection I have.
K.
All you need to play is dreamland 3 and 64
If that
They are only like 6 hours each
Then just play them
K
Mechanically
I feel like you are past the age to enjoy Kirby mechanical
Don't.
I'm so excited to play mgsv when I get home.
Ah
In
Why I'm february
What kinda game mode is dm?
I wonder if you can make room escape puzzles in minecraft.
While we float around and observe you while building giant dicks.
Where you just play a contained survival
Lol we should make you a bio sphere.
And we can have daughters and try to marry them off to gain influence.
All become rival farmers.
Guys let's start a farming server
I love bees
Fuck
She still plays.
Like once a week
Getting Megan hooked on minecraft I think is my greatest achievement.
I mean I'm sure there are minecraft married servers
So it's either going to be stardew or fe
Although I really want to get married
But doesn't have the same depth
It's got that length and width
Because that's not the same.
I wish there were better architecture sims
Farming in minecraft is only second to building.
Bump
Hey <@!125452744440938497>
Where animal husbandry is really hard
Like just making a farming sim mod
If be so fucking into that
God ronald
Is ds not cross platform?
Because you need a controller regardless
Which makes sense
If I could do it on my couch this would change everything.
One of the reasons I hate gaming with you guys is because I can't do it on my couch
We should all play sometime then
Oh fucking dope
And zone of the enders
Like all the armored cores
Plus I have so many console games i need to get through.
I needed desk space
And I don't want to go through the trouble of hooking it back up
Also I unhooked my pc
People on pc are too good
Too hard
No
I really want to get rocket league
Yeah but just as fucking brutal
That sounds like Gary's mod then
I just wanted to farm.
And live in my humble home.
I'm too sensitive.
Yeah.
I didn't have the emotional constitution to establish myself
I'm not emotionally ready for that
Civcraft all over again
And all our shit would be on fire
Then we would log on
We would log off
So
Yeah.
Literally the worst thing ever.
And if your body was still there when you logged off
It epitomizes my least favorite things about multiplayer.
Rusts multiplayer is terrifying though.
It was originally supposed to be an exclusive but I couldn't remember if they followed through with that.
K
Is it even on pc?
Even if rust is considered better
I think you personally would like nms more than rust though
K
It's definitely better than rust.
Because tbh it's probably the best survival game out there.
It's honestly a real solid games.
The devs just marketed it as something it is not.
I've already at least gotten half of that
And I can easily get 30 hours of enjoyment out of it
Exactly
Because I've been having a great time playing it for 20-40 minutes at a time
I'm really considering getting no mans sky now that it is so cheap
I need to start telling people I'm a pro gamer
So I play in the easiest way available which is free at the store
Lol.
I just want to play them
So I was just going to beat it in the store
Yeah It isn't very long
It's reall pretty
Also I've been playing this new game that came out call abzu
It looks real complex though.
And it looks real good
Also a new digimon game came out
We will go pacific rim on that shit
Yes
Fuck
Fuck yes
Lol tag team
And stop half way through 2
So I'm just going to have to trust that you won't play the first one
lol it's all on one disc though.
So it will be easy to get on your own
Mp1 is the cheapest though.
No can do
Sorry dude
Also still waiting for that $400 m'dude
Fuck
Well
Hmmm
Ronald can other people see this pissing contest?
Mac you are now the proud owner of metroid prime 3 and half of mp2
üëç
Now I've used it
I do but I've never used it
Also I just bought tales of symphonia
lol sweet
The collection

We got the prime trilogy at the store.
We should split it
Mac
all the humans in the world
he owns the whole world with his hivemind siblings
he doesnt just own the whole town
*just the same*
depicting the villager from the beginning to now
just do a hype ad
maybe they will do that for animal crossing
i dont
way to betray my millenial sensibilities nintendo
fuck
<:happyboy:230130509630406656>
*learn math m'dude*
it's 10/0
don't be dumb
jesus mac
wii u is only 1/10 of a psn
on a scale to how much of psn it is
yeh
that 1/10 is 1/10
Ill send you a proof
someone needs to explain fractions to you
oh sweet baby mac
1/10
sure i can
which what the fuck is that
you have to have their creator id
you cant even search for anyone like a normal person
yeah and its still a tenth that of ps4 or x1
still more than you
mario maker
nintendo  life
do
i did more online than you did
bro
bro
bro
It's maybe a tenth
Like the Wii U online isn't even close to a third
If even that
Yup
A third the price of Sony and xbox
Nice
Shame
Shame
Shame
they just get free milk for their benefits
nitendo employees no longer have health insurance
liek some westworld shit
they had a cow in the middle of hq
nah man
one of the comments on that gamesradar article "Milking a cow in a game my god what next wankin off a horse!?!.they need 2 stop all this stupid was look forward 2 the switch at first but more I hear about it the less I want1."
is if there was no screen
because I feel like thats the only way i could trick her into playing a game
I really want to get hannah to play this though
clearly did their heipher research
so gg nintendo
I showed hannah footage and she said "confirmed that is how you milk a cow"
for humans to practice how fast they are at their daily tasks
aliens will get hold of the switch and assume the game is some sort of training program
teach me how to human
best edugame ever
"hey kids we know you can't look your dad in the eyes, so we invtented a videogame to help you by making you do embarassing tasks while strangers and friends are encouraged to stare at you deadpan"
Normal human being sim 2017
üëÄ
YOU CAN LOOK EACHOTHER IN THE EYES
I can't see you walking into your class, laying down your switch and being like "anyone want to look me in the eye while we test our reflexes?"
yeah and multiplayer is more of thing there
for you?
def not
so you can really yank on that utter while looking your buddy toby dead in the eye
I love that it encourages you to look eachother in the eye
like the milking and the champange game
literally everything after that sequence though it super sexual
took me 20 years to findo ut
yeah turns out that's my fetish
still no children in these trailers
lol month 4 or 5 of the switch
I'm this guy watching
so just click it
i changed the link
the part where the two women shave themselves in this trailer may be the most arousing thing i've ever seen
https://youtu.be/S1r369yv2Uk?t=3m11s
or just advertise somehow
so I can get paid to go
I wonder if I can do something gameworld related there
then I'm down
is that spring break?
get all those hot fivers
then we can sell our skills on the interwebs
lets get so good at coc
like armored core
mac we should get good at a very dumb game but with a very complex multiplayer
lol "practice smash"
I teach your dad how to use an apple tv
cuz it aint like you gonna use it
once the switch comes out imma just take your wiiu
because I usually read 2 or so hours of comics
thats been the sacrifice
but I havent read a comic in a month
Yeah I've been playing like 3 hours every day
maybe two
I could do that in a week
and wonderful life is 20
bayonetta 1 and 2 together is only 20 hours
after bayonetta
Ill play it
which i want to get into
along with the hd collection of zone of the enders
anyway it came in the store
or just glossed over it
I probably didnt see it
oh
I'm excited to play it
I bought it yesterday
also I found a metal gear hack and slash made by platinum that has amazing ratings
I want to play bayonetta
no
Id just play batonetta 2
yeah but heres the thing
in which you do one boss (30min) a day
or unless it is shadow of the colossus
one week
ill trade you a ps3 for a wii u
lol
thats so weird because everyone whose played it that i follow loves it
the new one real good though
It is good, but it is just real hard
I 'don't think I like hitman
k
yeah
<@!71716577669550080>  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwS5yfwwfoU
casul
lol I want this
????????]\
but 4 came out in 1977???
how did star wars episode 3 com out in 2005
lol
1997
but tomb raider 2 was 1998
how did tomb raider come out in 2012
how did doom 3 come out in 2004
fine
magic
but doom came out in 2016
how did doom 64 come out in 1999
lol
god this voice acting is awful
lol
why
I'm starting hitman 2
lol yeah
probablu
who makes maps?
oh yeah fucking weirdos
o, we thought, what if you had to buy maps?
Then suddenly we needed a character that you would be buying maps from.
We ultimately ended up with a character here that had a little bit of humor to him that [came from] thinking of...'What sort of person would sell a map?' And, well, we decided it would be the kind of person who makes a map.
And the way that he makes a map is by floating through the air so that he can see the contours of the land and draw them.
But as soon as we got that far in the process, we realized anybody that would fly through the air making a map has got to be a really weird person.
So at that point we decided, okay, we'll go with this and make him a really weird guy."
original tingle designs are horrifying
you can find it online
yeah like hoblins are literally just kobalds
but now it is a "zelda" game
its interesting that in the beginning it was very much a fantasy game
the art is dope though
idk get the pinterest extension on chrome?
and now he's got to change all his FUCKING passwords
and he wanted a cool esoteric numerica; fact
because dk64 is his fovorite game
some dude out there has gone his entire like ending his passwords with 976
Lol what a development.
Lol
It really lacked charisma though.
Fair I just love when people with a certain skill use it for crime.
But I liked it
It just got real bad reviews
And math
Yeah it's bonkers
Did you like that movie?
Have any of you seen now you see me?
I want to continue ffvii but that's a lot
What console game should I start next?
pokemon fanart is so good
I mean I'm sure you probably can get some liek third party skins
no
?
the red ps4 controllers are fucking beautiful
i wan the ps1 version
Nice
K
lol
It's 60 for no real difference
Lol
Don't you have a controller?
So?
Why?
It's not nearly as fun.
Have you played frog fractions two?
lol fuck
maybe
who knows
yup
but if you don't then you can also engage with the imersive strategy of the game
which if you only care about the story that allows for great gameplay experience for you
yeah exactly
is the versatility for the players
i mean thats the beauty of minecraft
gotcha
exactly
which has nothing to do with difficulty
I only get bored when I stop feeling motivated
that's fair.
see there is always a building project I want to do so I never have a problem with that
for instance if it is purely creation then creative is just as engaging
i mean it just depends on what is keeping your attention
because we can now reach godlike level of progression in minecraft in like what 10-20 hours?
I get bored of singleplayer minecraft no matter what
I get bored of creative because it is singleplayer when I do it
I don't get bored of creative because it is creative
without having to grind for all the furniture
Eh, I just really like designing
so i just play it while I work
no but we always have a copy at the store
i like that game more than animal crossing
hhd2
just replay though all of these
thats what im going to do during class
nostalgia
fuck
http://store.steampowered.com/app/294670/
which came out the same year
I also had this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtVYZtEWs9s
so cool
this game would animate your drawings for you
shit this game was dope]
mine
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHahIxHZ9dk
but it definitly didn't
like 3-5 because I always just assumed my gaming started with the gameboy
I never realized how many games i played when i was very very young
lol you need a timeline
wii and the ds are the only systems ive ever gotten within their release year
and bought me nintendogs
so i just had to play pictochat for a month until my parents felt bad
this was right when it came out
because I coudln't afford anygames
I remember doing the same thing but being so pissed
and mall tycoon
I beat sims
except sims
nice I always had so many games, so I never beat a lot of stuff
because I got bored real fast
and then age of mythology, but I could never not use cheat codes in that game
like I would have my gameboy on pokemon grinding while I played the sims
and I was alawys playing sims
like i used to play elmo games even before I had a gameboy
nice we always had a family computer I used for games
lol it sounds like you are an old man recalling a tale
remember when we did this exact same thing, but with consoles?
!
thanks
Philip was so hardcore into runescape
and champions online
and toontown
i just had poptropica
because everyone was briefly nostalgic
It had a huge boom of relogins right before its death
lol
what do you think I should do with my time?
I want to play a game but anything I want to play I feel is too obvious
I have a 75  minute class that I don't need to listen to and I'm trying to figure out what to do with my time everytime I have it
hilarious
i saw that this morning
fair
(lonely boys)
since discord's demographic is more lucrative to target than most the people who use skype
im suprised it didnt happen sooner
üò¶ I dont get those
<@!125452744440938497> yeah
4?
lol
9.8/10
fucking awesome game
just beat mgs4
It is really cool
mgs4 has a level where you have to go through the setting of the first mgs
shit
lol
*plot twist the giftcard was for $15 so I just bought lube, because I've never touched a woman*
lifehax
so I just went on their website and bought like a years worth of sex shit
lol I got a walmart gift card and I dont want to drive to walmart
God the joker is so edgy

<@!125452744440938497> I have to write a paper on modern examples of amazons and I want to do the crystal gems
I need this
https://www.pokemoncenter.com/collections-s0107-0000-0000/Ditto-Plush-Collection/ditto-as-squirtle-pok%C3%A9-plush-%28standard-size%29---6-701-00073
Yeah I remember you making that
Holy fuck
üò¶
Can't
lol mac was literally wearing glasses when you hung with him
I think the playing 20 hours straight of video games while sitting 2 feet away from my tv for the last 15 years has finally caught up with me
i usually always sit in the front though
it hasn't been helping
ive been sitting in the front
that you wore glasses for that
interesting I forgot about that
because having a headache everyday is starting to take a toll on me
Yeah, I'll scheudle something soon
because maybe my professors just suck at making powerpoints this semester
I just dont know what is like the proper distance to start having strain with stuff
yeah it's been this way noticeably since school started
well i was just wondering if you would think itd be worth going to an eye doctor, or maybe I'm just overreacting to things that are just hard to see
and anytime I have to read something on the board I get a headache
but I noticed that I've been having trouble with individual letters
and I can read everything because I can recognize the words
everything in the distance is blurry
see its the opposite for me
because I've been having a real hard time during classes
does it cause eye strain and headaches?
interesting
but i can still read everything fine
but I can't tell if it is just my concentration or if it is my eyes
I've been having trouble seeing things
So I've been having a problem recently
I don't think so
Who are parents is fucking amazing.
I'm listening to the album rn
I actually really like this
No mans sky in creative mode is the most relaxing thing in the world.
Lol
like i mixed a big goat with a flower and got a fire goddess
lol its so random though
will probably go faster
yeah so im exctited to play again knowing that
but I realized like just as I stopped that you are just supposed to catch stronger demons and let the weak ones die
so when I kept dying I kept trying to train my demons
because I didnt really get the general concept of the game
Umm I dont really know, still really early on
no I do it all the time
cuz im a dummy
yeah for like an entire day and my game popped out
so I need to take a break before I have the endurance to do all that shit again
also <@!125452744440938497> I was playing a shit ton of smt but then I lost like 8 hours of progress
because I'm like 10 hours deep into mgs4 and need a break
the I can do the fourth anytime so just let me know when you want to play that
I beat the first three bosses of sotc for you
oh mac
yeah lets play undertale
but this is differnet because nintendo seems to be contracting
nintendo's purchase of retro studios was with a western company
maybe
because rare was in no way an indie company
but the fact that it is a western indie company is pretty interesting
probably but i wouldnt doubt if there was another we just don't know about
and was like "yeah this is ours now, don't talk about this game anymore"
it just think it is neat that as soon as they debuted this some japanese buisnessman walked up to them
yeah I hope this open up doors for them
hopefully nintendo will buy them out if it does well
but it pretty much likely means the death of their indie studio
hopefully this will open up more jobs for the dudes
im not disagreeing with that
no one is going to give a shit about sfbgames after it comes out
lol no
i know the dudes are making it
yeah but they bought the game
so the game that could have actually made them legit was bought
which is funny because is definitly the best thing that studio ever made
until now
because after that gdc there was no news about that game
lol anyway it's that nintendo just swooped out of nowhere and bought their game
so people could play it
too bad we will never get a pc version
<@!71716577669550080> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJGooKIoy1Q
I'm down

What is that video asher?
lol mgs4 takes place in the "not too distant future" of 2018
Thanks konami

Yeah
if youve ever wanted to check it out
<@!125452744440938497> tankgirl is real cheap on the humble bundle right now asher
He knows what he likes
True but it's better to just assume they know basic stuff and then they can ask questions
You were talking to me
Them
But you weren't talking to then
And it pisses people off?
Yeah
https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/01/26/kojima-productions-studio-looks-like-cool-bond-villain-hang/
IT IS ENGLISH
I CRACKED THE CODE
OH SHIT
I think
I recognized the word are
Like there are bullet points and everything
lol

Imma try to get a pic
this is how he takes notes
No ive been watching him since day 1
none of them are english letters except e
because there are a lot of dashes and very specific symbols
or just very bad english
I can't tell if he is writing in shorthand
So this guy next to me
lol
that is an all around great game
cross
Have you listened to the chronochross soundtrack yet?
I'm just writing my analysis of the mgs trilogy
otherwise i'd listen
I'm in class
along with bayonetta 2
Ill trade you a wii u for a ps3 so i can play it
I think I'm going to write mgs slash fic
I'm so bored
I was gonna say the switch has really good res
aw
This dude is a fucking pervert
I'm so bored in my astronomy class
lol I can't stop watching this
WHEN HE HAS A FUCKING SWITCH
I also like how hes watching a fucking video on the features of the switch
and he's so fucking into it
lol he's watching people milk
like legit though I can just put up my laptop, lay the switch on the keyboard, put the controler under the desk and go to town
Just milk a cow in my pocket
then I could milk a cow in peace
I would 100% use it during a lecture.
It enough like a tablet.
I beat mgs3 last night and now I have a slight minecraft itch
its also that was when samarai culture was the most bad ass
yeah it's one of the most popular stories in japanese history
yeah I think they are full of shit
<@!125452744440938497> you know the story is supposed to be based off of an unfinished akira kurasawa script?
I don't know how much I believe that.

I'm going to wait for the first week reception but I'm real excited.
Sure
For ire
Yeh
but gen 5 really should have moved away from it
it was for the first three gens
pixel art isnt a mandate of the ds
yeah and it looked even worse on the ds
I feel like in testing someone should have pointed out that these awesome designs looks like shit on the 3ds
i don understand why they did in gen 5 though even though there are other options
yeah
when they didnt need to make it 3d but making highres pixel images looked like shit on the 3ds
I still dont understnad why they went with pixel art for gen 5
its fine
they maxed out their technical potential
its the same reason why gen 7 looks a little worse than gen 6
it just has the worst pixel art since gen 2
gen 5 is finr
from a technical standpoint
i think its better than 1,2,4,5
and the remakes yeah
lol
you wont even play half those games
lol
psychonauts 2 is still supposed to happen then
because we got a shit ton of good games this year
for the year to be over
obviously we will have to wait
I don't know
*not the best*
no arguement there
definitely
and nintendo is obviously doing their nintendo shit
also I'll admit that 2017 offers a lot for original ip's
same with 2016
lol no dawg
2004
but like 2002
I don't know its obviously going to be a good year
not the avengers though
"The Avengers project is being designed for gamers worldwide and will be packed with all the characters, environments, and iconic moments that have thrilled longtime fans of the franchise," Marvel's press release states. "Featuring a completely original story, it will introduce a universe gamers can play in for years to come.
More details on The Avengers project and other games will be announced in 2018."
since you are getting a shit ton of nitendo shit
maybe it will be the best for you
you can't have a best year
you can have a good year
you cant have a best year of games without a pokemon
nah
if we get a pokemon
also square enix calls it a "multi-game" partnership
like I start with just ironman and cap and then go on and get really obscure heros
because I would love to have a turn based game where I recruit my own avengers
if you make a super hero game and you can only play as one character you are limiting yourself, which is why i was hoping it would be an rpg
but it doesnt have more than one character
because it looks beautiful
which i am still super hyped about
its just a spiderman game
we havenet had a decent marvel rpg since ua2
regardless I'm hyped
lol fuck off
you woudln't think they are making  a fucking televion show
that's like if lionsgate was like hey guys powerangers
you can
so yea
make rpg action games
and eidos and crystal
yeah we can
to get hyped
thats literally all we need
because we know all the developers
marvel rpg
https://twitter.com/Marvel/status/824633368218370049
lol
get ready kids https://twitter.com/Marvel
Options
The ten year old worst narrative oversight
Yeah
I didn't get the demo
In the full game
I've got like 20 hours
But a lot of triple a titles don't do that anymore
That's fair.
Nintendo has some pretty good demos
Yeah but demo disks used to have games that weren't out yet
Demo disks
You know what I miss?
Mmm... <:sadboy:230133848740986891>
I guess you'll just have to settle for the PS4
...right
Oh right well there's always the ps3
You could play it in your ps2
Lol
Or let me rip it for you
Just get a car
Nah
And its actually correct
lol I have to fight the ghosts of all the men I've murdered
And I want to know what drove him to become evil
I'm really excited to play it because I'm so attached to naked snake right now
And everyone tells you how stupid you look
Also did you know in mgsv if you play on easy it makes you wear a chicken hat?
Lol okay I feel like it is just semantics.
Regardless it is really really cool
If you eat the food it just cancels that quest like if you killed an important npc in fallout
Nah but the quests are already given to you without having to do the puzzle shit
Something keeping you from point b
I see a puzzle as being an obstacle
Or setting up diversions to use later
But like actually hiding in lockers and moving dead bodies and shit
Like not just sneaking past enemies
Also I like when stealth games actually reward you for being sneaky
Optional quest
Because it does.
If you build rapport with that guard he helps you later
lol I don't see how it's a puzzle but whatever.
It seems more like an optional quest that results in a different story path.
If in those room escape games if you didn't solve it within an hour it just let you out.
It's just non linear narrative
It's not a puzzle though.
It's never questioning you
Because the game gives you clues before you are there
But other ways if you fuck around enough
There is one correct linear way
But this isn't a puzzle
Windwaker wasn't doing this shit
Yeah but this is creativity from 2004
So a guard comes it to wonder what is wrong and you snap his neck.
Or you can go into the pause menu and spin around fast enough you vomit
Or you can endure the torture for long enough to get saved
And then you can use that information against the other guards
You can sit around and let the guards bring you food and refuse it until they open up to you about their lives
And there are three ways to get out
Mgs3 has this bonkers section where you are in prison
You know how a lot of times mac in a pause screen it shows your character and allows you to rotate them?
Nah
Let's blogify that shit
Yo dawg
I mean it is interesting that if you can get through the first one it really holds up
It's like "hey have you guys seen inception yet?
It's pretty cool!"
Yeah dude, we've been playing them for a while.
"Hey have you guys heard about these games?
They are pretty good"
Lol a 30 year old series for the both of us
The randomness of dungeon crawlers force you to stick to what is most adventitious
Mgs solid gives you the freedom to be creative through its consistency.
Procedurally generated levels is the opposite of what I'm talking about.
Also m'dude wrong genre
I've played a lot
It has like the replayabiloty of dishonored within the game itself.
And it rewards you for doing such.
So you can try new shit
But now you have knowledge of it from your previous encounter
Mgs is really neat in how each time you renter a room it is always a new experience.
It is either just a tool to get more items or a filler between rooms.
It no longer engages me
But when I have to pass through that same scene 10 more times I tend to just fast roll through it
Standard shit
Like battle everything, check for secrets and what not
Well when I play games and they do it the firs time I go through the room I interact with it fully
But mobs and items respawn
Like obviously not puzzles and stuff
Yeah I hope it does well.
But you know how Zelda resets every time you renter a stage?
Blowing up a random wall isn't creative.
Also rewarding exploration is different from rewarding creativity.
Almost any game
That's pretty much any adventure game m'dude
lol like what?
And created a different tone in my battles.
Because it felt like a big fun fuck you
Like one of the most rewarding things about the Zelda game was learning you could deflect projectiles with a bottle
Where there is more than 1 dumb way of solving it
A puzzle
K
Like imagine a Zelda boss where there are 8 different ways of beating them
Zelda puts the extra to the side
But you can't do extra during the progression.
Eh how?
It's so candy coated
Knowledge is
Ability isn't a requirement
And a single player game that rewarded ability beyond just simple progression.
Because I've never played a game that rewarded me so much for deviating from the norm.
And the whole game is about learning how to master them in intricate and cool ways without you even really noticing.
But what I'm saying is imagine 100 mechanics that you get from the beginning.
I never felt like I was getting better at that in Zelda games.
Same with aiming
I just spam b
Mac I've never known the sword functions
Lol no
A lot of newer games that have lots of mechanics have them as sort of peripheries.
But like windwaker has so many features that you don't need to really use.
And it feels really cool
But then they become second nature
Like too many at first that you think you'll never use them
I guess.
Maybe it just feels different because there are so many mechanics in mgs
Or honestly ride a horse well
You don't need to learn how to fish.
Not necessarily
Sorry
And all the Zelda levels are designed around utilizing that one new function
I'm talking about Zelda
Where you can't get to a certain area unless you got a certain thing.
Because is designed in lock and key method.
There are a shit ton of items and mechanics that revolve around those two concepts that create a magnitude of different experiences.
It makes it more fun if you do, but it is not demanded of you.
You don't need to know how to do all that shit to beat the game.
Think about all the shit you can do in Mario world.
I can use another game.
Fine I guess Pokemon was too much for you
Or stealth
I've never played an action game from me that demanded me to be good at anything that isn't shooting.
Exactly.
Mgs has bonkers mechanics.
Especially 2 and 3
It would be hard but you could do it.
You could go the whole game without learning type effectiveness, Evs, ivs or items
No what I'm saying is that you can beat Pokemon without knowing anything about Pokemon.
Also any rpg is challeging if you let it be
I'm not talking about challenge.
Lol m
No because dota you can win without utilizing everything.
It's like if the only way to beat the e4 was to make a full competitive team with max ivs
And all the items n shit
Like mechanics.
Anyway mgs is the only game I've ever played where you need to learn every feature.
Maybe but it doesn't effect the quality.
I don't have the ability to read but I can spam a
At least not while I'm working and organizing stuff
Not to me
Mac  I realized what I like so much about mgs
It just helps the narrative pace for me personally because I'm really impatient.
So that way when I have a spare 30 minutes I can make it through a section no problem.
Because grinding requires zero brain power
Yeah but it gives me something to do when I can't go on
If I can't kill normal mobs in 2-3 hits then I won't go further in an rpg
Or trying hard to make sure you aren't underpowered or overpowered
I care most about the story.
Rpg strategy is just who can grind the most.
I also just looked up earthbounds xp curve and it's pretty standard.
I do this in every rpg
So I need to grind when I don't have time to make story battles easier later
I don't have time to play
Also it's a nice way to get items.
I got tbis
I play pokemon
Sure but I'll then be leveled enough to grind there
At least for now
30-100
It's pretty decent xp
I'm in the cave
I can just turn on autofight and do work
Or dying
And not have to worry about keeping my health up with items
Because when I'm bored I can just go grind
That makes grinding more rewarding now
I always keep my pockets empty
Dope
Ah from the ATM or in my pocket
Are there any repercussions to dying?
He sucks me off
I also found frank
Do I have to use items?
How do I heal in earthbound?
Lol
It's like harvest moon with terrible Pokemon.
It's like the best non Pokemon Pokemon
But Mac
It was the best Pokemon spin off.
How do you not know about monster rancher
Lol you know monster hunter and monster rancher are very different.
Why
And I don't count Ronald because he doesn't read chat
Because Ben is in game asher is away
I want your opinion.
Or another ps2/ps1 game
<@!71716577669550080>  should I get monster rancher 4, brace fencer musashi, or legend of legaia
I thought my grandma had died lol
My greatgrandfather fucking text me ‚Äúcall me now, its an emergency‚Äù because he couldn‚Äôt figure out how to operate internet explorer.
just like anything
dumb
is the new mvc an option?
Thats interesting that more people are playing mkx

Level design got way bettee
Yeah I got past world two
Mac you need to play chibi zip lash when you finish chibi robo
GameStop has bundles
Also I'm at work so I can't play
That's why I want to play it
It wasn't just us.
We were able to order 1
Also no one had very many of the classic
So it's near impossible for us to place orders.
I was kinda joking I know why we don't.
Nintendo isn't very accessible for small game retailers.
Gameworld is very anti nintendo
I don't know.
I doubt it
Maybe snipperclips
And I was just thinking it would be a 1-2 switch party
Because I was considering buying it
Do you think it will be hard to find?
Party
Nice we should have a Saturday switch part
Mac does the switch launch on a Friday?
Just like game dev sim but as a shop keep conglomerate.
Baby is so good at branding.
Lol
My favorite character.
How is tphd?
In mgs4 he apparently voices god
but i feel like that same thing could be said about any visionary
apparently though he's just always been a dick to work with
and by kinda i mean a giant dick
I've been reading a lot about kojima recently though and apparently he's kinda a dick
#Hideohero
I wish pokemon gym leaders were more like mgs bosses
also just so everyone knows there is a boss in mgs3 that is literally just a guy with bees
anyway still some good deals if you are wanted to play on an actual television
and a lot of forums complained of the same
well it crashes all the time for me
yeah but the pc port is busted
which is a dope game
and asher psychonauts is 4
like thief is 5 bucks
there are a lot better ones for under 10
but those are just all the ones under 5
there are a lot more games on sale though
yeah
not backwards compatible
but i bought them
no
most of these aren't great but in case he wanted to play tomb raider or sleeping dogs

eh
it's almost like if alan moore wrote fantasy
ronalds just hiding now
that's fair
you and i both know animation is different
forgive me
you are right mac
no it's like taking what you've been given
also this is the best fantasy narrative we've every gotten in television
but that's just me
i find tangential lore to be the most interesting
then the cool shit is the lore
because if you are like me and the politics is the least interesting part
no but game of thrones does
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses
just get a nice glass of wine and read a wikipedia page
why don't you just read a history book m'dude
you just want more house of cards
along with the fact that there is a woman out their that can summon demon assassins from her vag
also the entirity of the FUCKING WHITE WALKERS
which is that the magic is a peripheral to the story
no ronald you can't deviate from your main point
is this what you want?!?
you want them to suck your fucking dick ronald?
and literally lit a dude on fire
gotta go back in my channel
hold up
I'm better
all done
gettin' a lil' light headed
wearing myself out here
I'm litterally just in a channel screaming
UI
AHHHH
AGH
NOPE
NO
THATS THE POINT YOU SLUT
that's not the problem
the tv show
then it would be the war of roses
ITS A FANTASY SHOW
ronald
also
it is magic coming back in a world that has forgotten it
the demon baby was an assassin
that was explained in the whole episode
it killed renly
you dummy
also the demon baby has a very important role
FUCKING DRAGONS
and you know
and magic crows
there are also zombie magic men in the woods who run off of magic
m'dude
lol
I'm going to scream
AND OCEAN'S 11 IS "HARD TO BELIEVE"?
YOUR FAVORITE FUCKING MOVIE IS KINGSMAN YOU GARBAGE PERSON
which was pretty controversial but is still pretty high for them
hollywood reporter gave it a üêõ  out of üê¥
and rotten tomatos gave it a "yes please"
imdb gave it 8 thumbs
its the best movie ever
ronald
even though no one was watching
but decided to dance through to show off
i always think he could have just walked through
i fucking love this scene so much
stop
no
its the best part of the movie
stahp
no stop
worst part is, he never found his phone
yeah he actually lost his phone and used the lost my phone app
that's how they found snowden
they just read the screenshots for the names
you got me
hmmm
some asshole was trolling our facebook page

thats how you listen to music like a champ
lol what a pro
shhh
becuase I don't think most people know that
so people know we are a local business
I wont to get more involved with the local community
because he's the worst
lol ron wont let me
because no one looks on our facebook
and put them where?
and just coast off that until graduation
raise
so I can get a rais
I've gotta find a way to make the marketing at gameworld actually good
11/h
but mac
so nvm relish
so I actually make abour 13.5/h
okay
because the marketing is a set pay
I just don't know how much I make hourly
I do
lol
doubtful
because with the marketing job I actually may make more than 11/h
i actually need to calculate whether or not i actually make more currently
come on
jesus ronald
11/h
where nothing is under 200
its like a bed bath and beyond that only sell the shit in my grandparents house
I could easily turn up my famboyancy
you can still not hire men
or at least say you dont
i think its illegal not to
I wonder if they hire men
while I still probably play on my 3ds
/h
yeah but 11
11/h
yeh but 11h
lol I'm applying to relish
why is that?
this is the best skin theyve ever introduced

It's only like 10 minutes.
Or all the cutscenes.
Mario
You need to watch a long play of hotel mari
Mac
I was also thinking you could make it a source mod
But it wouldn't be the same without voice acting.
I was thinking of how you could make it work with pixel art
So you have to find a way to influence the environment or characters to somehow bump into each other.
And turns out his high school sweetheart who he hasn't seen in decades owns the flower shop right by the bakery he gets his bread from.
So like some old dude goes to the park to feed the pigeons at lunch time.
And it's only set in a day or teo
And your interactions in the environment can change the daily routines of the characters.
Mac what if you are a ghost

.....
Ronald can just buy a 20 dollar Wii with brawl in the meantime.
It'll be fine.
Yeah
Since it is 90% for his brother.
I feel like the switch is definitely the best option for him.
Ronald you can be a dick and just turn off your brothers game from your phone.
So I can tell how many ice cubes
In my butt
Joycons
Nah
I'll just milk udders all day
Then I will never leave my home.
I can't wait until someone makes a hack for combining the joycons with vr
For other things.
I can't wait until someone mods it
Perverts
Farmers
Yeah but that is garbage
The resurrection of the mii
Good
Do we know that?
Rip 2006-2016
Miis are dead
I just realized mac
I'm hoping they have a Mario holiday bundle
lol I like that Ronald is going to have a switch before I do
Yes it is
Lol if anyone actually makes a fps for it
So I will need that restricted as well
I'm also afraid I'd use my switch browser for the pornography
Duh
I'm I would just have my dad set the password for me obviously.
The timer
I wish the PS4 had that
I love it
I put it on the playlist at work.
I've watched that videos at least 10 times now
Not ambitious enough.
Fair
Will be very much anti-millennials
Next earthbound everyone is 46
Reggie's
Whose fault is that?
No
Can you marry anyone in earthbound?
Mac who needs another dumb earthbound.
She still has it
So I gave it to ai
I bought a copy of Pokemon green a long time ago but I didn't have a system to play it on
Japanese silver still has some of the coolest box art
Including the 64 games.
I've played every gen imported
Not like words matter
But they are nes and sn games
Yeah
And be a total badass
Because then I can buy famicom games
No
I'm gonna try to find a famicom and sf when I'm in to tokyo
Probably.
It has a dope ass battle system.
Eric and I watched to opening to it.
Yeah that came out sometime in the summer
Are you talking about Tokyo mirage?
Even though I know I can't have it
And it makes me want a vita
I'm looking at the most popular games in Japan in 2016
But until then it's not
So you'll just have to wait
It's only going to be like 5 bucks cheaper
Fire emblem pricing works like Pokemon.
Dude
Awakening?
Because everyone is married to them.
I just want new women to marry

Okay good
No
Lol üòÇ
But I already feel lost looking at the box art
People really like the 3ds ones though.
Path of radiance
The only dire emblem I've ever played is considered the best in the series so I don't think I can ever get into it
Eh
So I don't think quantity matters here.
K well there are like 4 sonic games in the 3ds
Do you not count oras as mainline?
lol I mean Pokemon has 3
Knowing I started it after it essentially died.
Although that's how I feel about mgs
The story wraps up pretty nicely.
Nah
I have both of them
If you want to borrow
I have it
Mac have you played golden sun?
I just want to marry people.
That's what intrigues me the least.
And how you can talk to anyone.
But people really really like that battle system.
The story is the main thing.
Yeah.
That you can marry
Imagine Pok√©mon but for people who think monsters are stupid and want real people.
And they are all the same.
Because you can marry anyone.
Yes it can be
Yes
Yeah I can see that
is it any good?
no
and invented speedrunning
everyone knows miyamoto does all the debugging
nah man
artists can be good at video games
and posts it on fan forums under fake usernames
like he's probably the one who discovers all this shit
you ever wonder how good miyamoto is a sm64?
What a good psa
i didnt necessarily mean the medium but more rather the time spent on it
fair
mayhaps
like you can with movies or tv
but you cant do other things while playing videogames
i think they are an equal waste of time of movies or tv
it is super interesting, it just makes me feel more justified playing over 20 hours of the metal gear series in the last two weeks
i just am glad im not devoting my lesser intellegence to stuff like this
i dont think they are dumb
it is
i ti s
about wasting my time on dumb shit
this makes me feel so much better about myself
it's happening!!!!
mgs3 is so much harder
Gladion is so angry
Lol
I named him nebby
I nick named him fart
Lol nice
Just caught cosmog in a primer ball
I am so uncomfortable
You can't do this shit to me
The line between person and Pokemon is already so blurry
But that doesn't mean they should do it
It does
Pokemon has officially gone too far
Okay
I just got to ultra space
No
Guzma is the best
That's dope
Nebby was the legendary?
Hold up
Wait wait wait
but hopefully I'm wrong
i dont think we are getting a pokemon game this year
lol
whichever is first
or until mario
that I can't buy a switch until I beat skyward sword
I made a promise to myself
whereas i have no interest in replaying chibi this year
but if you beat sotc first then I don't have to worry about getting back my ps3
and asher's games
lol like i do with your games
chibi is around like 15
why?
sotc is like 6 hours to beat
because I want to play through smta after i beat 3
because I wont need it for another week or two
anyway you can even borrow my ps3
horse sterring is really hard
if it goes through I can sell all those games which would be nice
I found a ps3 with 11 games on craigslist for 80
I'm mlg
no prob
you should just wait
mac we just got in sotc for ps3
lol
what a nerd
he even did a breakdown of the odyssey trailer
hes so pumped
also I just found our bedford store has mgs3substince, which has mg 1&2 on it
wait until i get my ps3
yeah dude
but it is easy to predict
sotc has a good twist
lol
probably best twist ive ever played in a game
it was bonkers
this game got super meta in the final stretch
Im doing the second ending
mgs2
jesus this ending is so meta
i agree
yeah
yeah there was a lot of hype around that entire gen
xbox 360 sold the same amount
gamecube sold like 20 mil
ps3 sold like 80 mil dude
LOL
ps3?
I've also  been debating it for a while
lol
well I'm getting a ps3 wednesday
nice
did you ever beat sotc?
mac
im at the place where you get the legendaries
dope game
just beat mgs2
like the giant ones that were in every office in the 80s
I dont know if this is in your dads wheelhouse but what the fuck happened to all the old government computers
asher
i watch speedruns all the time at work
even though i watch all this shit all the time
lol i like how i havent watched any of this
can someone link?
oh shit nvm ill watch that
im immersed lad
mgs is teaching me about guns
depends on the nes game but yeah
or just spend 70 on the eshop
lol
but i love that games so mcuh
I always find an excuse to not buy it
I need super metroid
omg that boss battle was great
fuck i didnt know that
kojima really goes to great lengths to humanize every character
god these games have such good pathos though
same weapons
same characters
because its the same sneak stuff
metal gear and solid seem pretty similar
yeah
so same core concept but differnent in its techincal representation
so link to the past versus oot
from game play ive watched its like the difference between zeldas
that way you dont have to have played them to get what is going on
because mgs starts off with briefing you about the plot of mg 1 and 2
thats not true

and I like them
but there are a lot of characters in the series that are from there
they arent
because apparently they were ported to ps2
well then that means I can play them
didnt know they were different
my bad
I just assumed the nes and the msx version were the same
oh weird
heres the order of offical games
because metal gear 2 ends with big boss dying
he developed them all
thats wrong then
its liek the mario bros before super mario bros
no they are they arent spinoffs
this is great
lol I have no idea how to beat this fat ass
but those are minor games
yeah except there is one between 1 and 2 and another between 2 and 4
or rather snake is a clone of big boss
who is snakes dad
mgs3 you play as big boss
yeah
and then there are others that are not part of the main series but are still good
mtgs 4-2 (ps4)
mgs4-1 (ps4)
mtgs4 (ps3)
mtgs3 (ps2)
mtgs2 (ps2)
metal gear solid (ps1)
metal gear 2 (n8)
there is metal gear (n8)
lol here i can help
i was qrong
not a port
apparently it is a remake of 1
shit yeah never mind
and wait until he trips on his roller blades until you can attack him
this guy is rolling around on rollerblades and you have to diffuse the bombs he drops
it is fucking bonkers
mac you need to watch gameplay footage of this fucking boss fight
I dont have a ps3
gamecube just has mgs 1 and 2
but it has all the ps2 ones on it
hd is just for ps3
yeh
anad weighs 400 pounds
hes just bomberman with rollerblades
fatman is the best video game character ever
omg
those are just game mechanics
gg toby
looks neat
no
Which are super popular speed runs
Compared to Mario world or portal
The thing about metroid though is getting 100 is closer to just the normal speed run than most games.
100% is just assumed glitchless usually
Exploits are fair
No warp glitches anyway
No glitches
Fuck nice
Are they doing any%?
It's also a very technical speedrun
I'm sure you could have just googled it
Lol np
It's not that big of a deal
That you get a special ending if you do
Basically there is just this hidden quest in the game.
In the game
They are like ostrich alien things.
A really good ending actually
But it's a cooler ending.
Saving the animals takes longer
At the end of super metroid.
It's an ending
Also it usually takes like an hour to do
It's considering one of the most skilled speed runs.
It's a dope speed run.
And no one would ever know
Like I can literally just have infinite controllers and wires if I wanted
But I don't feel bad about it since I've been their best customer since 2012
And I've been abusing the hell out of it
I was recently made admin
And even more if i feel like discounting it more
If I wait for it to be used I get a 20% discount
I'm gonna wait until it comes in the store.
I got his action figure today
Yeah you know Luigi, that green guy from Mario tennis?
I got luigiibo today
Also mac
Can finally milk my hentai ladies
Truly innovation.
Amazing
Lol
And she didn't understand
I showed hannah
Yes
CUBES
You can count the cubes
I know.
Lol
They are just cumming over the hd rumble
The presentation.
They called it bonkers.
Not
Now making predictions.
But mainly they are just joking
We know about the service.
I love their talk about it's internet capacity.
Lol yeah.
Because they talk about the presentation
Just the ten minutes
You should hear the latest podcast
Each bundke
Yeah
He bought 2
Lol griffin is talking about his preorders.
Some guys are about to buy battleborn.
Should I stop them?
Reading about mental rotation is real cool from an art standpoint.
Yeah that's fucked.
Sacrifices
So you know
I've been slacking on comics to do this.
And by 30 I mean 22
I bought like 30 games for like 120 that I'm real excited to play
That's a waste of money.
Yeah
I've bought too many games this week
this game
the first boss fight in mgs2 is beating the shit out of a pregnant woman

til that the orange box is a mgs reference
Lol
I had to scroll down really far to find it
Weird it wasn't the first one on their page
I'm on their YouTube channel
Is the stream not on the Nintendo page?
I have to lube up for a solid hour
Mmm

Do you even realize what you are saying?
Yo what if?!
That'd be an interesting one.
Nice
this game makes me want to cry at the end of every boss battle
and tells them he's proud of them, and that they did good.
everytime he kills someone he just sits over them and listens to their life story
I fucking love solid snake
These mechanics are all still in games today
They aren't plagued by dated mechanics.
Just developers lack of understanding
Mainly tonic trouble and glover
Anyway I've played through and enjoyed much worse platformers
And the rest all look the exact same.
It has one well designed character
Banjo kazooi does not have crazy character design
So all the stages are aspects of the mind.
Also the premise is fun.
You've gone crazy and you play as your subconscious trying to get back all your marbles.
But I remember it for having good music and crazy character design.
Lol if I beat it as a 6 year old I think the port just makes it hard.
So I think I'll wait until it comes in the store.
All the reviews say the port sucks
It just has a lot of good memories for me.
I remember it being one of the first games I thought was funny
I mean to be fair I doubt it's a great game
Shit well there goes my weekend
I had no idea I only ever played it on 64
Fuck it's on steam
I should find a way to play it
Fuck it is!
What?
I remember really liking that collectabke
I really want to replay earthworm jim3d
Also chibi robo is basically a collectible.
Yeah sunshine is probably my fav 3D mario
Like sunshine
Those hold up way better
Why don't you play one of the collectible Mario games?
They def are
Those I love so much
It can appease two different kind of players
That's why it's a great game
I appreciate that
When I've been playing for an hour or two I can just blast through the game.
Especially once I've got momentum.
I'm just pretty good at it
Because going fast is more important for me
I don't like doing that first time round
Where that game I needed to walk through so bad
That was really important in silent hill 2
But actual technical stuff I do on my own
To make sure I'm going in the right order
Yeah.
I just usually read the progression map
Like basically it's only one step up from watching a long play on YouTube.
Also helps keep the narrative momentum.
But with old games I just sort of bypass the 5 collective hours of figuring out where the fuck I'm supposed to go
Not if I'm playing a new game
Yeh
Also I've given up on figuring out things in games anymore.
Because I don't have time for that.
Mario also does new game plus
Because you can basically do new game plus
Like technically mgs has replay ability
I think that's why I love the Zelda games.
Otherwise I forget the story and an no longer interested in characters.
As far as story games go I would much rather be able to finish it in 3 or 4 sittings.
But you just keep playing it
Because dark souls has 14 hours
What do you define as additional content?
If I had to pay 60 for both
Although I'd much rather take a 10 hour game over a 40 hour game now a days.
I paid 5 dollars
I wish more games were around that long
Also mgs is dope
So I'll beat it in less than 100
Also I'm only 49 hours into moon
And I've just been in the same place in Pokemon for all of break
Yeah but I did that 10 hours in less than a week
I love how I started and beat mgs before I beat moon
That satisfies a lot of my fetishes.
I'm going to beat mgs tomorrow.
So pumped.
Fair.
It's like calling a beat em up with two player mode a fighting game.
Yeah but not real balanced pvp with dynamic strategy.
Because there is no real pvp
Although to be fair I consider pikmin it's own genre
Yeah which is why I'm excited.
That basically the best games in the entire genre have already been made
Yeah but that says something about the genre
It's p much just Starcraft and aoe2
Yeah pikmin doesn't count dawg
Considering everyone has been playing the same two games for the last 15 years.
Because the entire genre has been stagnate
But basically I'm excited for its potential
I've played a lot of halo wars and I can say it doesn't work as well as pc obvioisly
The card system will make it more fast paced
No halo one was slow paced
So it revolves entirely around combat strategy
So it needs to find a way to make it more fast paced and less bass centric
Especially on console
Because it knows it can't compete
Yeah but it's at least trying something different.
I've played a lot of aoe it looks like it is going to be very different than that
Basically instead of resource management and society building you just use card management to manage combat players
No it is rts
It actually works way better than I was expecting.
Halo wars 2 is combining aoe combat with hearthstone.
Rather than all around resource management and what not
Was more focused on just combat
It wasn't as dynamic though.
Sure
Basically a really slow and easy Starcraft
Just standard rts
To spice up rts's finally
It has such potential
Have you heard about the mechanic it is introducing in rts's?
Halo wars 2
Mac
Just literal low res static jpegs
Jesus that sounds amazingly terrible.
There's always been dating sim stuff in fe
If they do this right it could be revolutionary.
Also Mac have you heard about the game mechanics in halo wars 2?
And you can only unlock characters by buying shitty packs.
Next fire emblem is going to to have e reader cards
Instead of a Wii balance board.
We will get the Wii hover board.
Wait for the peripheries asher
It's called the Nintendo switch
They have.
Yeah by far
Asher just attach a PS4 to a roomba
Seriously make vine but with warioware-like mini games
Because the last real one to come out was FOR FUCKING EVER AGO
Really mac?!
I want to make a warioware successor.
Lateral bomberman mechanics that pay homage to ic
Why not both?
Boomboomboys
So it'd have to be Explosion-Guy
We'd have the change the ip
If you could just make a shitty bomberman game
Mac imagine instead of waiting for a shitty bomber man game
We will make it fun
Yeah but here is what we will do differently mac
Minesweeper dx
Ugh guys.
Let's make a game company.
And just make shitty flash games for PETA
Lol rents cheap
It's been like 5 years an no one has turned out a decent indie game.
But still
And the arts department has classes that cross over
Programming but there are several design classes.
But I've never heard of anything actually coming from there though.
Very gritty
Very dark
lol serious sam is a very serious game.
We are laughing but as soon as Ronald finishes that class Ubisoft is going to contract him to make the assassins creed banjo kazooie cross over.
Once you take this class you will max prestige in cod black ops 3
Turns out being a casual just means you haven't taken this class
A serious gamer
Classic luke
He made skyrim as his final project.
Most people don't know this but Todd Howard actually only took one semester of non serious games class
Turns out in non-serious games class that's whether you are hard core programming in the havok engine.
Lol
Once I have the skills to do that I'm out.
That's it
I just want to make a vr dating game with waluigi
The medium has done more in 30 years than most have done in 100
Fuck him.
Who does he think he is
Like what does this guy even know about gaming narrative.
All of it
Reading that shit.
Omg I just got triggered
No one knows.
What even is a game?
Let's grow neckbeards and take a game class.
Mac let's do it next semester.
Been there done that.
Or rpg maker for the ps1
Or just a class in the department.
We should so take a game dev class together sometime.
Just to fuck around.
Mac
Basic bitch one degree removed.
So you are just a bitch then
Basic bitch
Ronald you live up to your name.
I miss the days when games had you swap out discs right in the middle of a sequence
two
onto disc twi
did it
nvm
<@!240129712645603329>  the coms tower level is fucking impossible
stuff where you dont need to focus on the plot
I should send you some things sometime
hmm
because movies are kinda like a 2 hour long cutscene
but you dont watch movies/ animation like that
because they are most like movies/ animation
lol
or cgi shit
why dont you like animation?
i dont understand why you arent more into art mac
lots of angles
gotta watch those polygons real good
lol
hideo is my boy
this game is actually fucking dope though
that way i know it is a flashback
but this time with a nice sepia filter
for replaying an entire cutscene i just watched an hour ago
lol thanks mgs
I know there is.
I just don't know the distinct differences.
I'm still not sure in the difference between cogsci and psychology though.
It's just an interesting field of study as a whole.
Because I would have loved to pair this with an art major.
I wish I would have known about this department when I was in high school though.
Says something about the department im sure
Boys and girls alike
Which is nothing but cute ai's
That's funny.
Because I come from the English department.
Classic misogyny
Which is more likely
Or auto fail it
I wonder if I sleep with her if I could just auto pass the class.
Nice she looks chill af
Mac do you know Anastasia nikoulina?
Lol prof still isn't here.
As long as I come to class i won't have to exert any real effort
It's a 100 level class.
Ya.
I'll be good.
Easy class made for babies
Easy then
Because I really just want to have my laptop out the whole time and waste time.
Thai could be a problem.
Hmmm
Or less
I have a theory that any class that has more than 100 people in it I can pass with 50% effort.
Mmm well we will test that theory.
My attention level is directly correlated to class difficulty.
Exactly.
Which is why I won't pay attention.
It'll be easy
Yeah you can.
Because I'm just gonna be on my computer the whole class not paying attention.
<@!71716577669550080> you should be my q101 tutor.
I've also finally learned how to communicate with my grandfather

<@!125452744440938497> thermal underwear is maybe the best investment I've ever made.
you are muted but it is only giving me the option to mute you not unmute you
i dont know how to unmute you
can yall hear me?
k i can play for a bit
okay that was way too hard
let me pass this torture test though
I can play for a bit
good guy kojima
and someone will call you to bitch at you for smoking
also i love that smoking slowly drains your health
gg
this game is great
i think it is 3rd
I dont think any of them are
no
that psycho mantis boss fight was crazy
otacon is my favorite character by far
those polygons hold up
oh fuck you right
Im sure that was the sexiest thing in gaming in 1998
and then they zoom in on her polygon ass
also i love the parts where solid snake is like "you got a great butt" to meryll
1998
goty
love it
this is amazing
they literally have a cutscene explaining what an otaku is
LOL OMG
shit now im there
no but thats literall 90% why om playing it
yeh
FINALLY FUCKED UP GENJU
this boss is literally pro genji
this boss is like fighting a pro genji
died first hit
lol nope
so i should get it this time
im stuck on his third wave but i think i just figured it out
but i like that im actually getting punished for it
I do
not because you want to
you have to do a no damage run because the game forces you
thats what i love about old games
no
i goofed and used them all
there are no more health packs
so its gotta be a no damage run
I only have 1hp
gray fox
k
come beat this boss man
mac
they are all equally boring
?
coo coo coo
ronald im looking at you
someone needs to drive over here and beat this boss for me
you hsould get into the hard core mb scene
khfdkhgfdg
GOD THIS FUCKING BOSS
agreed
its okay though cuz the devs still get paid
but that shit happens all the time
you arent wrong
most companies dont sell canceled games
but they wont
they could
so unless microsoft sold it no one could pick it up
microsoft likely bought all rights
I doubt they can
yeah they dont screw over people and try to micromanage their development
so microsoft really just screwed themselves more than they screwed platinum
because nier is going to be real good too
its gonna be interesting though mac
thats what you get for dealing with microsoft games
yeah they will bounce back
yeah no suprise there
scalebound?
so I was a ohko
because i was too stubborn to go back to find health packs
although i spent an hour on one boss battle
its 11 hours
metal gear solid
k
also I'm 5 hours into mgs and it is fucking amazing
we should play a couple of games of ow tonight
what a classic
oh the ol' FoFLTCMaCLoCaF
I went to 3 classes
That's what I did in my mongol history class
In these dumb ass classes they know that people could easily pass without showing up
That's because in most of your classes you would need to show up to at least half of the classes to get an a
25%
I'm going to end up failing this class because it takes attendance.
I'm internally screaming.
Symbols
Short stories v "long" stories
Setting???
What is plot
What is a character
Things we will learn
This class is a joke
That is not a joke.
The syllabus is in comic sans.
It's for my English major
But I never took them.
Required for freshman
I'm going to blow my brains out
First slide "what is fiction"
I'm sure you'll be find bud
Or another place that has less demand.
So worse case scenario you can just drive down to a Walmart in Bedford
Luckily we live in Bloomington.
I got the Wii at launch date
I have to take an intro fiction class and I'm going to die.
Lol.
To keep the people wanting.
Yeah he's pretty much the dude who came up with staggering the us release stuff
Ah
I don't know if he was president.
I think he was cfo
Shit
So dude knows his shy
Dude is pretty much single handily responsibly for the marketing management of Pokemon though.
Like they just treat him like a senile old man.
I hope they all treat him like a boring ol' grandpa
I mean Nintendo before reggie was not this goofy
It woke have been dope if you were here.
Too bad.
I have an hour to kill in ballentine
They will do the same to kimoshima.
It's all part of reggies marketing genius
Lol none of them are the type
Honestly he probably will.
Now
What is your schedule from 12 to mow?
I meant the switch.
But I'm ready for the joy con revolution.
Broke
There is a wrestle boy show that day but I probably won't go.
Coo
What day is the direct?
https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/5mwxyu/noticed_this_mon_calamari_who_cant_find_his/

That I don't feel like an asshole using.
Because I need cash
I've been saving them for years.
My grandpa gives me a bunch
lol I just deposited 300 dollars worth of 2 dollar bills at the bank.
The clerk was.
It amused.
Especially when it breaks it down towards the end
As shitty of a game it is adventures of link has a dope overworld too
I think it's the best version of that song for sure
Maybe
Tales of symphonia
<@!71716577669550080> do you know what a great starting jrpg would be?
Dumb ass middle school keenan givin' that shit away
I DIDNT REMEMBER IT HAD A CASE
FUCK
awesome!
cuz we all gonna be hanging
ben are you free the 30th, 31st or 1st?
every grass type in that game is the best
okay cool
<@!125452744440938497>  what is your work schedule for the next week?
You guys want to play with me after you guys finish dota?
It's going to be really weird
My dad and i are going to the movie today.
yeh
I was thinking I would try to find some combat mods
and the combat isnt engaging enough to justify it for me
Like I want to replay it all the way through but the dungeon designs to me are just so boring
I literally dont remember anything about the main quest because besides going to oblvion i hated the main quest.
I know the end quest though.
I just mainly rememeber doing all the faction quest lines
ive just never beaten it
What mods make oblivion playable?
Asher
I'm pissed it's an Xbox exclusive
I'm so fucking excited for cuphead
I suck at ot
Cool.
I love the new doom
I just rent it from the store whenever I want it
Also Mac this game is so dope
I got Mario party 6 as well so mac bring your controllers
Awesome!
Especially when multiplayer is involved
The idea of a class based heist game seems extremely dofficult
I have no doubt
I've wanted to play it since I heard about it
I hope so
Not genius.
Well designed
Which is genius.
So if you mastered getting there then the combat shouldn't be troublesome.
But it's cool because each of his mechanics were taught to you by the stage to get there
But real easy
Like the first real boss is fucking dope and his animations are crazy
It is real cool
Play with controller
Good
But the "had drawn" animation style is just too fucking good
And Zelda kinda does but not as much
Also it's super cool because it does it's level design very similar to what mark brown talks about is successful about Mario
And doesn't do just like the generic stuff.
Also the game so far is pretty accurate in its Norse mythology.
Because you feel like it's a cartoon rather than a game
But the art style is amazing
It's not like titan souls
It really idnt
It's not that hard
It's pretty great so far
That's why you should play it
It has bosses
No
<@!71716577669550080> jotun has the best dynamic soundtrack I've ever heard in an indie game
I remember watching test footage for deadpool in 2013
Especially comparing it to things like games.
Yeah mac that's not that big of gap of time
Like excerpts or anything
Asher have you ever read anything Aleister Crowley has written?
My internet is out.
Especially after midnight.
It's worth checking out
There are like 5 different quests at the hotel.
After midnight.
You should go potty in the hotel
Have you gone poop after midnight yet by the way?
And makes them sleep in the cold
Your link steals people's hotel rooms
lol
So she would waste like 30 minutes before she could get anything done.
lol yeah.
When Megan would play she would save all four places all at the beginning of every day so she wouldn't feel bad
But it takes like 2 minutes to do so I wasn't complaining.
To keep retriggering the ice melting
lol I had to battle goht like 8 times.
If you go back and do it at the end of the game you can get each dungeon done in like ten minutes tops
Lol.
But seriously.
It's like grinding in Pokemon.
Also the reward for getting them isn't worth it if it's causing you this much stress.
That's just where they are.
Because you aren't completing the dungeon to get the fairies.
It's not doing to twice though.
And new songs.
Because it will be fun to re explore the dungeons with all your gear and knowledge of the game.
But do them before you do the final boss in the game.
Through.
Also almost everyone agrees you should never try to get all the fairies your first time though.
Lol
Spam that shit
Just double tap
After the first time you wear it?
You know you can skip the mask animation right?
Almost every thing you mentioned is skippable.
Lol
Game is is the best
Yeah.
And then it is oh shit this is horrifying I want to shut this game off and die
Then it's like oh shit this is super sad
The the Gorons are like oh this is weird and about them dying in the cold and their cult of personality but okay
Like the dekus are a fun little Zelda thing
After that
Each quest is more emotionally taxing
Yeah.
That's when the game starts
Gotcha.
Ah
Same place.
The ranch
Did you save the girl from the aliens yet?
That one is such a tear jerker
Lol
That's why they have all the side quests though.
Lol
That's fair.
A jrpg will add some spice and energy into your gaming life.
The thing about jrpgs though is they aren't easy games made for children
Because the mechanics in chrono trigger and the mechanics in bravely second are essentially the same.
Jrpgs are 99% about story
If it's the only thing they do they should do it well
Yeah it's like what you were saying about sotc
Then just play Pokemon.
K
But almost none of them have better combat.
Almost every jrpg has a better story than every Pokemon game
Here's the thing mac.
That'd be a good start
Download chrono trigger
Yeah mac
If he's just looking for good story lines.
Yeah I don't think he should be looking at jrpgs
Play Bayonetta.
Dude.
But as far as the story goes it was okay for me.
Which is great for first timers
Because it makes it like ff but way more forgiving if you aren't familiar with the strategy
The class switching system is also a major aspect b
But for the most part it's a ff game.
I mean I would never stop you from trying.
Bravely default is a good start because It has a combat system a little closer to the Mario rpgs
If you own a ps2 PS3 PS4 a vita or a 3ds and you don't play jrpgs you are missing out on literally half of the games.
That's just the way systems that aren't xbox are now of days.
That's literally all the vita is.
The vita has a way larger and better jrpg library.
Eh it's not
https://youtu.be/1jLOOCADTGs
Guys guess what we are seeing opening night?
But I wouldn't recommend it for you per se.
Yeah real good.
That's hard because I don't know if you like those games.
Yeah.
Fun fact the people who come into a game store on Christmas Day are not quality folk.
I accidentally bought melee
That's too bad
Just spent like 3 hours at the Lopez household talking about China.
Mac
Yo go on my twitch channel and let me know if you can see
You should join chat
Working on it.
You should watch me stream kazio mario
Mac
mmm k
I just got old man macree
you hear about carrie fsher?
asher
anyone want to plat with me?
to both of those
yes yes yes
yeah that would be dope actually
and I'm considering doing a chuthulu one
I thouhgt about that
mmm
@everyone  Im desinging the faceplates to my 3ds, any ideas?
I think the architecture in this movie is some of the best on the movies yet.
The end
There's just a big bomb and everyone in the whole movie dies.
Mac literally everyone dies in the end
But geez
Same.
I've rarely ship characters
Yeah it was dope.
I'm seeing it again with my dad.
I cried.
A lot.
Rogue one was pretty good
Hey Ben
Mega pikachu
Play overwatch with me
Ronald.
It's good
You should actually
Mac join call
Mac would know
Yeah I can do that.
9-11.
I'm just filling in for a bit I think
Friday morning.
Yeah but the first two gens aren't necessary.
Nah
Or x
Fire red
Thank god
You don't even know.
A joke only ronald and Keenan really get
üòÉ
keenanamay@gmail
Keenana
Password is pawntoc5
Username is my email
I found it
I doubt it
I don't remember.
I maybe have ine
What will that do?
I don't know what that means.
Although I don't know if I can without registering windows.
Anyway.
I'd appreciate just using your hard drive to play overwatch.
Pokemon is 6 I think.
So shouldn't they be less then?
Also Ronald the thing about pc games is they reuse things.
Lol last guardian is 15
Because Beyonc√© complained about the size of bb
That's why dark souls 3 was so compressed
Is going off of ps4
Batman is 50
Fallout 4 is 40
Bloodborne is fucking 41
Dark souls 3 is 20
Dark souls 1 is less.
Most of the bulk of your games are indie things
Yeah but you don't buy a lot of triple a games.
But still that's more than I need.
I have
Really?
Yeah that would actually be really great.
You should send me a hard drive link
Nice.
They really should have made a donkey kong arcade style rhythm game though.
Ha
The best mobile game ever.
But still.
I think I'm going to redownload solipskier
And coins.
Which is neat
Yeah the tricks and what not
Eh.
From the couple of time trial things I did the races aren't that engaging.
Then you've answered my question.
K
Just the levels.
Is what I'm asking.
So do you think that's worth it
Once I beat all the levels I'm deleting the game.
I know how I play games
Mac here's the thing
Which in this situation is me
But they don't matter if it's not fun for the player
You can have as many features as you want
Yeah but theory is way different than practice.
Lol
I feel like you haven't actually played the game.
That's pretty dope asher.
It's still just not my thing.
And you can only do one toad rally a day
Not saying it's not fun
Which isn't fun for me personally.
But that's just finding the path
Cuz it changes once you get them.
Yeh
All coins
I do like the level design though.
Which aren't that rewarding.
And the rest is call coins and speed points
I already got all the collectibles for the first three in the first ten minutes
Lol not really
Like tiny wings is actually a great game.
Lots
Yeah
I think it deserves better reviews.
It just isn't fun for me
I mean I don't dislike it
I really don't like it
Mac should I buy Mario run
K
Because then I wouldn't be able to download it again?
Wouldn't activating it ruin it though?
I'm busy as work.
Gotta give me a bit
Well if it does work you should send me a link to a hard drive I should buy
Okay
And sell it to me or something?
K
So what do you recommend
Noice
In dark souls
<@!240129712645603329> where are younat
Just literally the word rogue
Cool
This is probably a dumb question but is rogue one at all related to rogue squadron?
I'll bring that over around 9:45-10
K
Just the power cable
You don't need keyboard and mouse though right?
I'll bring the seagate as well considering a lot of the important shit is split between those two
Also I don't have to stay over I can just drop it off.
I don't get off work until 9:30
It's just sitting in my closet now.
I could actually just drop my computer off with you tonight if you want.
Lol
You should really bring that hard drive over sometime.
Ugh
All alone
üò¶
Which is why they are making so many classes in all the new buildings by your apartment.
So they don't need to
In all seriousness though the idea is to make ballentine obsolete
It'll crumble to the ground.
It'll never happen
Just on top of the chemistry building.
Lol
You would needs way more than 15 million.
Except you couldn't shut ballentine down for 3 ywars
I wish they would do that with ballentine instead though.
And redoing it.
They are basically stripping the entire building.
Because they are redoing the im entire infrastructure.
It's a huge huge renovation
I go there every Thursday.
You should go there sometime with me.
It's s big deal
Yeah dude.
Until I come into that sweet sweet cash
I don't want to buy anything
Eh
Maybe ill start a new bloodborne file like I've been telling myself I'll do.
Asshole
Overwatch?
OH WAIT
I do
Insurance
<@!71716577669550080> I may or may not have just come into some money so I may build a pc
https://youtu.be/xSXofLK5hFQ
This is probably the best video game review I've ever seen
Cool
I don't need to buy it right?
LAN party on the 1st
Yeah the 31st
It's fucking amazing.
You need to read the summary of the previous game and then play through vlr
It may be.
It's on PS4 and 3ds though.
<@!125452744440938497> you need to play virtues last reward
Someone just shot the Russian ambassador.
Shit
They are making an onechanbara movie
how are you?
Hi mac
rn
we are installing 10 though
nope
He's trying to fix my computer
I does i do?
i guess
I don't know what to do
ugh
lol now it is just doing the terminal blinking
just a mac
nope
that's all
it gives me just the option to choose which drive to boot from
but no safemode
or mios menus
it gives me boot options
I don't really know how to do that
no
and it will just stay there forever
when I boot up it is just the window icon
yeh
no
oh wait
yeh
so no im confused
but it didnt before
it actually does now
any suggestions?
im in the bios menu though ronald
I just tried to turn it on this mroning
nope
and its a desktop
it can no longer read my harddrive as a bootable device
I was having a craving to play new vegas
so pissed
I dont even think Ill have the cash to order one until wednesday
Ill just play on my snes
no i can
because christmas
I literally have no cash right now
I just need it to work
eh
I cant really afford it
ssd?
cool can i just put it on a flash drive?
can i get that from iu?
someone should help me this weekend install a new one
awesome
yeah so my harddrive his hella busted
awesome
lol now its jiust black
i didn't work though
nvm i got it
how does i do that?
Every time I restart it.
It's just this with no loading icon
@everyone please
yo anyone know what to do when your pc won't boot up?
Because it is a little white CUCK ball
Lol
I had that same realization.
I know but it reminds me.
It reminds me of a game eric Chan had on his calculator.
I'll get it for you
Portal 1
It's like nintendos portal and
But better
But then I saw it was Hal and I freaked.
I bought it because it was a puzzle platformer
I was recommending it to someone at the store.
I have it
Oh right.
Didn't I ask thar?
Which is fucking baffling.
Also she knows who the silver surfer is but has no idea who iron man is.
Because they had very similar upbringings.
I want to introduce asher to her.
Yeah.
because other than mobile games most of the medium is all about capitizing on the childhood nostalgia or introducing new thing that are too difficult for newcomers
and so when those kids got older they just had no interest in the medium
and wouldn't let their kids play
a lot of people our age grew up with parents really afraid of video games
yeah but it makes sense
that was it
except one time we got drunk and played mario kart
never played a video game
nope
which was really intutive of her
her first question when I explained mmo was "I bet people are really mean on those"
no
nope
lol
did you think i mean just mmorpgs?
which is adorable
She calls my 3ds my mario though
and why anyone would want to play one
I had to explain in depth a few days ago what an mmo is
that is kinda boring
eh
not generations
i meant of the show
geez....
and the episodes suck if you are watching them the first time as an adult
yeah
except I don't think I want to watch all of pokemon generations
I think I need to make hannah watch all of pokemon generations
ampa=grandpa
dra=dragon
grandpa dragon
yeah
I can see that
lol
literally had no idea
and asked her which one was pikachu
so i showed her a picture of pikachu, eevee and marill
keenan: you probably do and just don't know it
hannah: Umm i don't know
because i was like do you know who pikachu is?
literally no idea
but nope
I thought she was kidding
NO
nope
no
and i don't even know how i would explain dragon grandpa
because I had to explain why charizard isn't just a dragon
I need to have a podcast where I explain pokemon to my girlfriend
shit
this is the dragon
this ain't a dragon

girl


gf just asked why I looking at pictures of dragons
big black spoiler
lol
no
http://i.imgur.com/nT4WerM.jpg
don't worry about it
"white lil' cuck ball"
lol
so nbd
so asher and ronald will play with me
I mean ronald is done with finals
probably the best thing besides lucioball
Mac the brawl is really fun though
but all of my minecraft desires have been satisfied since I've been practicing architectural design
I would maybe do some stuff again if it was in creative and only played for like an hour a day
minecraft?
but it went away quickly
although I got the minecraft itch again yesterday
Eh I have pokemon
so she doesn't need to see that side of me
Also I'm a dick when I play games
I really like that we have our own different things we do, that gives us an excuse to not be around each other 24/7
Because I used to have this idea that someone I like has got to be into all the same things I'm into and do all the things I like with me, which is in theory nice but doesn't really work for me.
And I'm trying to keep it that way
Nice, my girlfriend has never played a videogame in her life
did you get good at darksouls?
Nice
Okay no problem, I'm sure we will play some soon.
Did you guys meet when you lived there last year?
Is your gf at collins?
Ill be free tomorrow, I'm going to a part later tonight
k
lk
Anyone want to get a game in?
and that was super fun
because ronald watched me play amnesia in highschool
I'm too scared to play it alone
Ronald you should watch me play outlast when you come over
I asked three hours ago
Classic
I'll join
someone play brawl w me
back
yo you motherfuckers ever heard of ni no kuni?
I'm gonna have to hook up my computer
KK
So does anyone want to play tonight?
I didn't know you still play him
do you play anyone who got a skin?
gotta admit the brawl sounds fun
k
k
looks fucking dope
yo have ya'll seen the trailer for the new fast and furious?
http://www.polygon.com/2016/12/13/13936334/pokemon-sun-and-moon-global-mission-results
they always work for me
sorry my dude
The brawl is also just basically my favorite game mode from call of duty
The emotes are really really good though
They should have made rienhardts hammer a candycane though
I just saw her reel and she had a skin i didn't recognize
Yeah nvm
Maybe it was just a potg reel
we should play a game tongiht
http://www.polygon.com/2016/12/13/13936786/overwatch-holiday-update-skins-costumes-new-brawl-blizzard-entertainment
That and the winston are the only ones I want
it is perfect
also I need the zenni one obviously
the widowmaker one is dope
I feel like my grandfather is trying to make a point, but I can't figure out what
same
Lol
Whyd he transfer?
Campus.
I realized I hadn't seen him since at least I graduated.
Nick I mean.
<@!240129712645603329>  I just saw your brother and didn't recognize him at first.
Yeah but I've spent so much time grinding that I welcome the challenge.
I genuinely believe video games gave me the ability to walk in the snow like a champ.
<@!127535721857679362>  I just had a dream where you really wanted to buy a psvita from my store and got really upset and wouldn't talk to me when I told you we were all out.
can we be in chat, so I have something to do while I make quizlet things?
^
which takes up way less time
then we can get into competetive pokes
actually though you and ronald need to get into pokemon
I was actually going to say basketball...
Do you know what we should all get into instead?
üòÉ
We know Ben.
We know.
How about words with friends?
Aww
Actually let's all get runescape accounts.
We should get into lol
Ronald how does that make you feel?
It's like watching the end of an era.
Ronald I'm so excited for you to come.
I work at 2
I can only do early.
Friday.
No way he's gonna read those papers.
Oh shit then yeah
Since grades are due a week after and he's a really lazy grader and hasn't done any of the grades for our class yet.
And I'm certain my professor isn't going to read the paper due Friday.
Because my last final is a joke.
Honestly I finish tomorrow night.
I finish Wednesday.
But I have a paper Friday.
Comics and music.
But it's only 2 bucks a month.
I'll buy an external drive and then stop paying.
Music and comics.
And then I'd have to transfer like 80gigs of stuff to a new account.
I hate my umail
Ew nah
Interesting.
How?
Box does?
Still hate it.
Box
Bix
I hate the iu
I upgraded my google drive to 100gb yesterday.
TO LISTEN TO WHAT?!!!
It's crazy
My aunt has all the smart lights/ thermostat shit
So if you ever buy another you can get better sound
But mainly with a Bluetooth speaker you can have it synced to multiple speakers
Yeh
Just buy Bluetooth speaker because they are easier to upgrade.
I'm gonna hack his google musoc
I need his playlist.
And conservative radio.
I think that's true mac
You should make me a playlist.
Ronald what music do you listen to?
Just buy good speakers
Why?
and then eevee for blue
to make it easier
I think I'm just going to do pikachu actuall
I was thinking one of the evveelotions
because i love snorlax
otherwise yes
Snorlax would really fit to scale though
pikachu, charizard, and who else?
what three pokemon do you think would be best for red?
I think that's what I'm going to draw
his arcane skin is fucking amazing
where the can zoom onto every individual panel so its more sequential
a lot of comic reading apps have a feature built in that can sort of do this as well
i don't know I didn't download it.
Marvel has this same things called "marvel infinity" but it's nice becuase they publish a normal version as well
and this sort of takes it away
it just diminishes a lot of the value of the comic for me, because what I love about comics is the simulteanously liner and non linear nature of them
i think its nice that they are trying to find ways to maximize the use of digital comics
but maybe I'm just a purist
I think it is trying to be animation too much without having any of the benefits of animation
but rather jumps around
that's interesting because I think it makes it harder to read comics for me, only because it doesn't keep to a natural left to right flow
but I hate it
so it is supposed to feel more sequential
where it isnt just a normal comic but rather uses the fact that is a digital comic to load images over one another
I hate those
I really dont like that it is one of those "augmented" comics
but there are better options for pc
I use SimpleComic
you have to download a cbr reader
FUCK YOU LONE DRUID
NEW FAV CHARACTER
SUN WOKONG IS A FUCKING PRO WRESTLER
THAT COMIC
OMG
im in fucking love with the monkey king
I also really want to draw the monkey king
i would draw super heroes but everyone does superheroes
yeah i feel like drawing pokemon stuff would be easy for me becuase i care about it, but its also marketable
because i just want to use the orignal designs, but they don't fit in with my rendering style
which is really hard
I've been trying to draw pokemon in my style all week
and one of trainer blue
one of trainer red
I'm going to try to do two pieces and make them look as professional and in my style as i can
lol okay
rip
lol
but hanging with me will keep you from playing dota
k
you still need to let me watch you
I'm gonna try to try to make some professional looking graphic stuff over break
uhhuh
lol
uhhuh
in your honor
and i can beat twiligiht
you should let me borrow your wii u
lol
so how is dota?
Others are boring.
Some episodes are good.
yeah
Didn't you see civil war?
Pretty neat
So how about Michael Keaton as the vulture huh?
That's from the interweb

What the fuck
Pewdiepie
So win win
Yeah my aunt wanted to get her son a 3ds so I don't offered her mine for way cheaper than she could buy it and way more than I could sell it
I got yours yeah.
My 3ds just got here.
I don't know but I can see if there are any good ones.
Spider-Man
Also Spider-Man
You do know though that 99% of phones that can run Mario have data plans right?
Man
Fucking
Spider
Hype.
New Spider-Man trailer.
Guys
Guys
I wanted to draw trainer red.
But I think I accidentally just drew a beautiful boy

i meant hoarding i used the wrong word
and make you feel fucking terrible
it would just fuck with collectivist behavior
no it would be monster based
actually...
undertale does with earthbound
like how frog fractions does with flash games
I would want to look to a base game for inspiration and then build upon it
that's fair
that's why its gotta be weirder
eh but waht about that frog game
i wish it was weirder
same
and continously introduces new mechanics and trope references
but it grows in complextity and self referenciality
i just really want to do something like stanley parable where the initial plot seems straightforward
schoolgirls?
hmm
because there is usaully no animation
even the graphics are easy
the hard part is the writing
the easiest part of a dating sim is the programming
book
like a choose your own adventure game
its just a story game
have you ever played a dating sim?
no
llol no
because i was talking to my professor about all the potential of the medium and the only commercialy successful art game is stanley parable
I want to make it an "art game"
but we just gotta take it slow
yeah
and grow fucking weirder and weirder
teh thing is that it should start traditional
because there is so much potential there to make a fucking hilarious game liek hatoful
i want to make the worlds best dating sim
yeah
oh hi ben
like just fucking weird
compared to this
like hatoful boyfriend is tame
exactly
make it fucking bonkers
because we are the most qualified
k good
we need to make a dating sim
you me and mac
asher
And two different secret channels.
We have a channel called "nickelback rehearsal"
Lol
So they know I am still talking.
So I send every sentence.
Because I don't want anyone interrupting me
I only do that when I rant
Though
A lot
Do that
I
Instead of skype.
I wish I would have had discord in high school
Hmm
I don't know about your brothers channel.
It's also because I think we are all good friends in real human life
Cuz we are cool college boys.
Just waiting for someone to breath into its embers.
That subreddit is still alive.
/r/onaldsunite
It's basically just a subreddit for our friend group.
<:curse:248225815005757442>
<:beardboy:243897428619558913>
Lol.
Just taking pictures of you.
I feel like Clara isn't doing any work



I'll have to go during break.
I still can't go that Friday.


relying on the fact that people would rather play them portably
of just only coming out with a few games and porting a bunch
thats just the gameboy model
I mean
definitely
luigis mansion is definitly my favorite gamecube game
double dash and mkds are definitly the best mario karts
(console gaming)
the best game of one of your favorite series
double dash
but you have played so little
so you are such a diehard fan
how basically your nintendo gaming carrer just begins with the wii
i still can never get over that
good thing i already own all the gcube stuff
I saw that on eurogamer this monring
and maybe ever
this game has the best selection of grass types since gen 5
honestly ben
Correct
üçÑ
üçÑ
üçÑ
Nice.
I'll watch it when I get home.
And the controller you got me.
I still have Pokemon.
No I have no real need or money right now
Yeah.
Last Friday
No I thought it was out forday
Amoonguss
Breloom
Ludicolo
üå±
üçÑ
Excegutor.
I am going to have a team of only plant head boys.
And goomy is god
Chespin was top for a few days but his evo ruined it.
He changed everything.
Until üçÑ
Oddish is always top
It's always oddish though.
Probably.
5) <:god:230133457630658562>
4) oranguru
3) chespin
2) üå±
1) üçÑ
He is the best boy
Yes
#1
My fav
I just don't want to waste my time.
K
Yeah
I've been using him for a while.
What about donkey boy?
Cool cool.
Okay
I haven't used it yet
What about wishiwashi
K
K
What about mushroom or footfetish
Like non happiness or level?
Are there any other 7th gen pokes that have weird evos?
Ugh.
That it's not level based.
That's crazy
Fuck
What about chargabug?
Well that explains my level 44 crab boy
What seriously?
Also how do you evolve crabbrawler?
With an erection.
In my room.
Because I was alone at night.
That made me feel weird.
That was...a lot
Making a lot of progress.
Btw just beat the grass trial.
I can play it while I watch you play twilight.
Bring it sometime
And it's worth repeating a second time
Just so you get the vibe.
Honestly what we should do is play the first hour of it on the n64
Which they fixed by adding a quest page.
The hard part is just remembering all the quest lines.
The dungeon design is also beyond easy
So I doubt you will be frustrated.
Although the 3ds version makes it way easier
Don't let it frustrate you
My favorite Zelda game.
I can't wait to talk to you about it
Cool
Your should start majora first then.
I care more about twilight though.
I want you to come over whenever you start either.
Will
I woll
We will get you ready for the 3D world big leagues.
Well I would start you off with a more formative platformer.
3D world coop is the best though specifically for that reason.
I disagree with the first part
Then we can finally open a speedrunnig twitch channel
I'll whip y'all into shape.
lol I will do my best.
Lol full PowerPoint presnetation.
Basically the entire time Ronald is here I'm going to leave my house open as a sort of 24/7 hang spot
Lol yeah we also need to have our Nintendo marathon.
Yeah smash would probably be a good idea.
I'm also going to take Ronald to an artsy party
Who do you think would be good to invite to the 30th party though?
Nice
So I'll play overwatch when he's playing
And tag team it
But he and I were going to do the dark souls dlc
Except philip
Lol yeah
Just guys being dudes.
I want to keep New Years small for tradition purposes.
It will basically be the same thing just with the girlfriends of your friends.
And I would maybe invite more but I'm.
It really sure who yet.
Because I would invite Ben and philip and asher could bring their girlfriends
Like double the small
I was thinking we would have a largish party on the 30th a small one on the 31st and a LAN party on the 1st
So I'm trying to figure out how I want to organize our get togethers over break.
lol
if you can figure out how to get into it
I bet you the battery isn't that hard to replace though
waddda racket
and 15 every year
so you pay 30 the first time
they have a replacement program which gets you 50% off
yup
nope
but the battery only lasts a year
its not a subscription service
basically makes it a subscription service
that's pretty shitty that it only lasts one year though
shit this is perfect
yeah she has a kindle and an ipad
tablet
what's the difference between this and just a normal wacom table?
she already has that
I'm also getting her a bunch of lesbian cmoics
but she already has a vr set
I was actually considering that
lol
I was thinking of getting her a drone https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NHLAL58/ref=s9_nps_hd_bw_bHVm3Ix_g21_i3?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-4&pf_rd_r=22167N433F7H5Q32130M&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=6d4d5bbe-195d-514a-bfb1-a829e1e1f6cc&pf_rd_i=16043777011
like some bullshit thing for $60 that would have been on the front of gizmodo
hey so I got my aunt in our secret santa, and she is a huge tech person, but she is rich so anything that is cool she just buys for herself.
Are there any cheap but sort of "obscure" tech things you can think of? @everyone
you should facebook message him
yeah dawg
<:curse:248225815005757442>
*rinse and repeat*
then I will buy another
I'll wait until you drive all the way back home
but not all at once
Ill buy three then
k
Ronald if I buy 1 will you drive over and give me a donut?
and are not only selling them a commodity, but friendship
you are pandering to the consumer's deep sense of isolation
it's probably only because you called them fam
lol
he got a new fam
That's why he doesn't read the chat
We leave him alone for a couple of years and this is what happens.
"Thanks fam"

...
And because this sounds so much more interesting that tfa
<:sadboy:230133848740986891>
No
<:god:230133457630658562> <:god:230133457630658562> <:god:230133457630658562> <:god:230133457630658562> <:god:230133457630658562> <:god:230133457630658562> <:god:230133457630658562> <:god:230133457630658562>
<:god:230133457630658562>
Choochoo
Chop choo
Yeah but I won't be available until  after finals
Because rogue one is the first Star Wars thing I've ever been looking forward to.
Sweet.
Same offer goes to you <@!240129712645603329>
I want to see it, but I don't have time opening weekend.
Asher will you still see rogue one with me after you've already seen it once?
Yesh
i got a colorfly
Where do you recomend getting music?
Yeah, gotta figure out how to try to keep it organized
My MP3 player just came in.
Looks neat
but ff15 took those two and sort of merged them to make it faster pace, and not just fucking boring
because thats the same thing, except xenoblade just added the party system
you ever play kingdom hearts?
which is what did everything before enix
because the company who did xenoblade is essential squaresoft
back in the day
but the dude who did xenoblade did a shit ton of ff games
xenob;ade and ff15 arent the same people
The thing that is most different about ff is that its cutscenes aren't boring, and its combat is a lot faster
the best thing about xenoblade are those two fucking titans that beat the shit out of eachother
also in just playing the first two hours of both games, I like the story of ff a lot more than xenoblade
they just hadnt brought it to the ff franchise yet
Yeah but it's basically the same mechanics as a lot of the other square enix games
sure because the dude who made xenoblade is the same dude that worked on all the final fantasy games
and i think you mean that xenoblade looks like final fantasy
and I like playing this
except i didnt like xenoblade
this could be the first square enix game I play for longer than 2 hours
the entire gist was that the experiences outweighed the problems
they gave it a 9
that was polygon too
but I think as a standalone its a really good game
ffXV is getting really good reviews, most the complaints I've seen are from people who are fans of the series
I really like Cosmogramma
Asher
the public is interested in pokemon
btw
hey guys
don't worry though i just fixed all the bugs in that sentence, now they are all features
In a heteronormative interpretation, Laura demands lizzie to ‚Äúhug me, kiss me, suck my juices‚Äù therefore replacing her dependency on this economic temptation with her own friendship.
I love what I do
it is...
yeah
I'm woring on a paper about goblins, lesbians, and consumer culture
dolla dolla bills
cool!
how is @everyone
hey guys
Yeha
It's neat
I've been playing it for about an hour now
I've been playing it for about an hour now
It looks like ff14
Yeah it does
So they didn't interview her.
And mercy had the flu
Well it was support centered
Designed
To be fair the the first 20 pages are well design though.
This doesn't even have tits.
And tits
Playboy at least has really good writing.
That writing is terrible.
God
I'll leave you to do that on your own.
yeah one glass of 6% shouldn't get you anything more than buzzed
so id basically be the same as beer
but youd be diluting that
12% probably
turpentine
Honestly the hitboxes are the best part of that game.
...you are right.
<:happyboy:230130509630406656>
Oh boy
It shouldn't because dark souls is ez
Sweet thanks!
Sweet!
I want to get more into electronic music too so if you have any good starters that would be cool.
Thanks daeg
Already heard it
<@!125452744440938497> !!!!
I need a good high energy electronic album
Asher
Nothing that I WANT to do.
Otherwise I would
There's nothing I want to do in New York then
But it was a little too heavy for me.
There was a pretty okay road bike on Craigslist for 100 asher that I would have gotten
Nice
It's also nice but looks shitty enough so no one steals it.
It was the lightest bike per price point I could find on Craigslist.
350
I actually bought one today.
because I feel like it would be interesting to also address the possible glitches in them and how speedrunners handle them
or maybe you could do like a 15 minute episode per mario world
thats fair which is why most maybe could be shorter
like 5-10 minutes per level
but really cool
I wonder if anyone has a channel where they analysize every mario level
that i never pay attention to
I like how he is analysing all these levels
and im watching the mario maker one rn
3dland
ill watch them at work
otherwise i would watch all of these
I'm glad im not doing homework at my house toingiht
shit these videos are really cool
white *midwestern* men
white men
he also calls in every week to bedford every week to make sure nothing good came in
from extras he didn't need
he's basically where most of their games came from
no game world knows him
<:keenan:230127774562516992>
he's a dic
Tod Curtis
I know the guy in the artile
Oh shit
when I looked up the most valuable games of all time so that way I didn't screw anything up
I remember this from when I started working at gameworld
yeah
oh man, not the arbys
I know how that feels
im sorry
fuck man
are you serious asher?
and then get nice headphones
I guess I should just get another aux cord for it
yeah I guess
It's just a sound bar
I agree, but I was thinking for when I have people over
do you think I should spend more money on headphones, or get decent headphones and then invest in getting a lil stereo thing for my room?
because i just orderd that colorfly yesterday
speaking of which, I've been looking at good wired over the ear headphones
That's what they all say.
<@!240129712645603329> better or worse than dwarf fortress?
That's good
Breeding
So there is still merit to breedong
That makes sense
Interesting.
Maybe
Hmm

Mac why does Tauros have an evo slot?
Nice
Lol true
I'd feel bad if asher was over and im just playing Pokemon.
So i can play pokes
Y'all should play dotes tonight.
oh forum posts from 4 years ago.
Lol
https://youtu.be/4GbDa2UnAO4
<@!125452744440938497> Gregory and hawk sort of reminds me of Tiny.
Asher how offended would you be if I left you around midnight to go hang out with my lady friend?
I've listened to Blank Banshee.
I like it
Sweet thanks.
Yeah
<@!125452744440938497> any albums you recommend?
Fuck
That is true.
It's very continuity heavy.
Nah
Mmm
I mean ps4
Yeah, at least the 3ds version
Thanks dawg
The one we meditated to.
Hey asher what's the name of that track of those tracks just slowly distorting?
Yeah.
Just making sure
Asher are you still spending the night tomorrow?
üëåüèæüëåüèæüëåüèæ
I'm like really inspired by that
Gg
It doesnt
You buncha sheep
I don't give a shit about your consumerist bs
I'm talking about the comic
It was too much.
That comic
Omg asher
HBO
It's basically like what if Disney world was 1984
It's based off of an old movie I really like
Sci fi show
It pretty gewd
Im@watching westworld
Ugh not another soul caliber.
They yoda was too op
üëåüèø üëåüèø üëåüèø üëåüèø üëåüèø
Mac join call
K
Give me a sec I'll join call.
Cool
Games?
The fuck
I also want to make another bird guru
Do it
And a bear team.
And an all amphibian team
I need to have an all reptile team
Fuuuck
Fair
Fir
Lol
So you know what colors are ideal for printing.
All 10% increase of CMYK for printing

Btw Mac I found this picture last night which is really helpful
Ben, how is the house?
You should get him dimensions and then one extra kit
Not if he's getting dimension anyway.
Lego dimensions is way bettee
It was okay
And then anything after that is a pkus
Okay yeah than for sure all you need is smash and Mario kart
Mario kart is a lonely game
I don't know will he play with friends?
Dimensions is good
Don't get him smash either
Don't get him kart, Wolly world or Zelda
And like you could probably 200
Mario maker and 3D land are the games you would want
You should buy one from <:curse:248225815005757442>
We gotta get the spinach artichoke dip
Shit
Mmm
I think you just got chicken tenders at Applebee's
You did
We could gag you
I'd order for you.
And you could sit on my lap
Still.
We can hide in there
Nvm midnight
No but they close at like 3
We should invite Miriam
We have to wear our Sunday's best
I don't think you can actually
And philip
Nvm
Oh right
We can go to the Applebee's and sit at the bar
I wasn't joking Ronald.
Who?
Now I gotta get the lil' wood boy
I was really scared happiny wasn't going to be there
Worth it

25 pichus later
What a cutie
üòÑ
20 pichus deep
I think the concept of sharing seen Pokemon amongst friends is genius
I want it
Send me that qr code my dude
Not in the berries?
K
Grass?
Anywhere specific?
Is he on the island?
I haven't seen the bagon yet
If I get a shiny pichu I'll be so pissed
What is this shit
This pichu is just summoning pikachus
It was amazing
I used the Lucha one in oras
lol Mac you are so basic
If I were to evolve them all I think it would easily be above 90
I've only evolved like two pokes
I think
I'm missing one exclusive, happiny, bonsly and one other thing I can tell what it is
45
Now I need to find that happiny
It was okay.
I one hit all his pokes
Rotom didn't lie to me
I was right!
This carbink just summoned a sableye!!!
By games we mean Gary's mod
And the hair dicks
No
I've been here for two hours because I think there is a sableye somewhere
I'm in the cave with the rock dogs
If y'all can
I want to play tomorrow though
I won't be free
When Ronald comes we need to do an all nighter at Applebee's
Speaking of whcih
I love that I know where that panel is from.
The tradition continues

I'm still at route 2
You are so far ahead of mr
Nilfgaard is such a cool combination of the Spanish and Dutch empire
Mac I love your sexy face
its patricia
no
definitly newer
pretty sure i misquoted that
<:curse:248225815005757442>  I value my personality <:curse:248225815005757442>
<:curse:248225815005757442>
yeah
Got it
Oh yeah
Shit.
I've got an hour to catch a chikerita
You showed that lvl 8 growlithe
lol prof justvwrecked this growlithe
I ran into like a bunch
It's not rare
I also hate shiny crobat
That was jus the trying it iut
I can easily get a chain to 40 if I actually prepped
Not worth it for now
Ugh
After about 30 chains
Finally caught a zubat.
Yeah v.7
Rotom is a huge part of this new game ronald
No he's in the cave
Rotom
I love roton
lol
So it's worth it
Yeah but it increases good iv chances
I'm just gonna catch this muthafucka
I'm done with this
This is gonna take some time
I saw that
Hmm
Does switching reset the chain?
Because no one wins when that happens
lol yeah mac
I like how you made him open it in public asher
lol still chaining
I've been chaining zubat for 10 minutes
Because pve is an easy game made for children
I never worry about types
Lol
Too cute
Just caught a diglett
Hmm
I'm doing the trial
Whaaaaaa
Wha?
Wha?
Wha?
I love that
This game has everything
Omg growlithe
I want to join team numskull so bad
also me
Me

I've been using my raticate and pikpik mainly
Lol
Except pokes that don't evolve.
In which case I only keep them for 10 levels
That way I get attached to everyone
And have it on my team until it evolves
Which is catch everything
I just do what I always do
Loser
I'm so happy with me team
Lol
I haven't seen it yet
So is pursuit
The mean look animation is so good
Yeah.
Yeah
I did not notice
I did.
It notice
So ugly
Shit my ratatta evolved
Yeah.
That's hilarious.
It'd be so hard to catch though.
You should get it
Lvl 10 Salamanca
Lol
Or iron head if you are a total dork
Like most steel type Pokemon either have to be tanks or know bullet punch
But he is still hella resistant.
Yeah that's a tragedy
Yeah which is why you only need bullet punch
The rest of the steel moves are nasty garbage
Like only bullet punch is worth having
But their resistances
Steel types don't really have an advantage because of their noves
Gyro ball is worthless on any poke except ferrathorn
Best pikachu clone though will always be raichu
What a cutie
I love my grubbin
My electric type is going to be grubbins evo
Dugtrio is going to be so good in ou btw
I had that problem when I used a normal type move on a digglett and was like "what the fuck why wasn't that very effective"
Lol
But i probably missed some thing
I'm trying to make sure I get everything on a route
Like what?
Two of my favorite ghost Pokemon.
So early on.
I'm gonna have her on my team for awhile.
Along with the drifloon
Yeah
That lil lady was a bitch to catch
Have you found the misdrevius at the cemetery?
I love this game mac
Is it to get beans?
Cuteness is also important.
But a woman can't rely on beauty alone
As you can see I'm an alluring woman
lol perfection.
Hilarious
Mac you've got to catch a drifloon and show it to the woman in the pokecenter
Interesting.
And audino and a smeargle would actually be the perfect duo for that
In which case a baton pass duo would be way better for chaining that just a sole smeargle
But any other attacking move would work.
Actually you wouldn't want false swipe
That way you don't waste pp
So protect, water veil, ingrain and false swipe
Because it sounds like you would just need something to keep both Pokemon alive
Do we know what Pokemon can summon?
I wonder what features will be available for shiny hunting
Fair
lol I'll make one too and then you can just sketch all my moves
Asher which one is Carl?
Lol
And sketch just permanently copies the last used move
So you can reset
Smeargle learns sketch every 5 levels
Like spore
The hard part is getting moves worth the smeargle having
lol it's not that hard
With a flesh hat
He's always been like a small child
Nah dog
He's like 3 feet
Yesh
I think they may actually have scaled them based upon actual sizes
Like I don't know if you've noticed but the models in battle are much more to scale than x
It's amazing that they didn't just port over all the x character models.
They made him more gaseous and did better detail on the face.
No it's just a really cool model
Looks dope
Have you seen the new gastly design yet?
Goty
Honestly
I just want a Pokemon game that looks like windwaker
I just want a Pokemon game that looks like windwaker
I look forward to seeing it on the switch
And did it bad
But then again there were a lot of snes games that tried to do 3D
So bad
Yeah honestly though any non Pokemon or snes ports sucked on the gba
Literally the switch for the snes
Sp best console of all time
Scratch that
Snes best console all time
Yeah whereas the snes is actually a major techinwl improvements that go beyond devs
Didn't know
Did know how to make 3D games
The 64 was fine it was just the develepors
The GameCube definitely was not a perfect improvement on the 64
Ever major game on the snes is fucjing incredible
Oh for sure
But I disagree entirely
I respect your opinion and will fight for your right to express it.
Like nothing for me in a game is more satisfying than breezing through parts that made you rage quit before.
It's so awesome to do a apart over and over again and notice yourself be able to do it way easier then before
Because those games are only like a couple hours if you are just save spaming
Also most rewarding
That's like the best part of nes and snes gaming
That's definitely not a problem
I watched a video breakdown of it and I honestly would never buy it
Lol
That was the case with the Wii and the amiibbos
It's not because they underestimate
Yeah but that's just how Nintendo works
Because most places only bought around 10
Actually it was the stores who underestimated
Any
We couldn't get abt
No
That's not on me
And apparently we only sold 3 copies of sun
30 minutes after open
We ordered 20 copies of moon and just sold out
lol Mac
we need to cosplay as them mac
my boys
love them
love it
I didn't realize they even do the animations during battle
theyare perfect boys
mac i got to meet grunt a and b
true birthdays are whenever you get pokemon
lol
happy birthday mac
oh shit
agreed
yeah
I love mini game collections
raving rabids was probably my most played wii game
they are just minions but 100000x better
they lend themselves well to any universe
How many rabbids games have you played?
I would obviously love to see properties that I love like the prince from katamari, but that would never happen
rayman, earthworm jim and chrono are like the last real franchises I think should be represented in smash
that could easily mean rayman is going to be in the next smash
shit mac
i've honestly grown up with more ubisoft games in nitendo consoles than nintendo games
and I would love to see how they tackle higher profile brands like mario
I love  the development team who works on rabbids
also if ubisoft is doing most of the work then I'm so exicted
can you blame them
I mean

I NEVER KNEW IW ANTED SOMETHING SO BAD
THIS IS HYPE
hype
is
This
...
...
...
like if they will take advange of the full techinically capabilities of the switch
I'm interesting in how big the game is going to be
Lol
like peed herself, or like you watched her go to the restroom?
...
THE BEST
THE EVO ANIMATION
UR MUR GURD
Mac you are so far ahead of me
Spoilers
yes
and sassy
he is so helpful
Mac it's weird because it's night but it's day
Isn't neebly the cutest?
Yeah that cut scene was the best
It's a better bed than yours
That would make no sense
<:god:230133457630658562>
Lol
Actually asher I should be good.
I think I'm just going to talk walk tomorrow now that I have Pokemon.
Thanks though.
<:curse:248225815005757442>
That's what they all say.
But this is literally a pokeweek
Not because o don't want to bond with ben
I vote asher over me
So that's 1) Pokemon 2) witcher 3) divinity.
And over break I guess
Aight I'll play this weekend with yiu
I can maybe play with you
Let me know when you get to class mac
I don't think I could do anything except fuck around
I've watched a lot of gameplay.
the sole survivor of a forgotten age
only gen 5 mega
also mega audino
also mega steelix, bunnery
lol
and garchomp, abomasnow are gen 4
mega heracross, houndoom, and tyranitar are also gen 2
lol
gen 2 actually has amphoros too
and 4 has lucario
scizor
gen 2 kinda does
I need my gen 2 catered
because right now its like 75% gen 1
actually yeah taht makes a lot of sense
lol
like everyone is in teh same place
Fuck they really did not feel like spacing out all the aloan pokemon
now this shit will get real
Oh yeah, got the xp share
NEXT GEN TECHNOLOGY
omg the map even has a waypoint marker
k dude
becuase you got pokemon early
you would be super popular
that's what i meant
do you want me to come into your math class and give you pokemon so all the nerds will know how cool you are?
not perfect
pokemon still can't follow you
no
because with the new 3d its a lot easier to get dis oriented
like a map you can just have up at all times that tells you where you are
not having a live map
this game fixed my biggest problem with x and y
OH my
lol
I forgot about bewear
Oh my god
it's baby makin' music
that main track in pilotwings is so fucking soothing
ik

I definitly think something liek smt has enough draw to specifically me where I will still like it
lol
also I like devils and shit way more than I like pokemon
pokemon having good story and character is only a recent invention
by having really good story and characters
games like that have to compensate for not being pokemon
you to understand something mac
I really want to play it
I've been watching videos
yeah
the only minor characters I've ever cared about in the past are blue and the dancing boy from x
this is the first pokemon game where I actually care about the minor characters
mac
fair
Ben cares
GAME OF THE YEAR
MAC I FORGOT DRAGON GRANDPA WAS IN THIS GAME
FUCKASDKJGNALSKJDGHLAKJSDFGH
No I'm not

but if its a slow burn to bonkers, I'm going to be disappointed
it's been silly
I'm disappointed
the game has yet to get bonkers

It so good
You gotta play this gane

sorry buddy
Into a single person?
Cosplay girl is so in love with me.m
Also asher you are so right
If we pinned anything from that period it would be easier to start there
They are somewhere in the backlogs of you are feeling ambitious
How is lillars of eternity?
Lol
Why
Ronald would
I hope so
Sam would make such a good drug dealer.
Asher I feel like drug deals are way less shady than buying a guitar
That people are allowed in sometimes
Because this channel needs to be renamed mac and Keenan's private chat #2
Lol
Because I'm pretty sure you and and I are 42%, asher is 10%, Ben is 5% and Ronald is 1%
Sometime we need to do a break down of the main discord channel of how many words per week each person posts into the chat and the percentage versus the total.
Mac
Distributors usually get things at least 5 days in advance
They usually do
Yeah it works great
Yeah I have that with comics
Oh
You'll get it before release date though
I'm up for the challenge
In one night
100 hours
I'm gonna beat witcher 3 tonight
*bad*
Makes sense
So pretty
Looks brand new
A nes edition sp just came in.
Shit mac
Nintendo knows




Warioware games are fucking incredible
https://youtu.be/AASeTbHFvSQ
Song for the playlist mac
So is everyone going to buy watchdogs 2?

This is my favorite graph ever
It's okay bud
I'm clever like that
Yup
I don't know why that's default on there
https://youtu.be/sZQcOiFilCk
Actual song of the week
at least for me
technical capabilities doesn't necessiate increase in quality
so it can work both ways
sure but no 2d mario game has surpassed super mario world
so I subject myself ot that level of fun
well I hate myself much more than you do
but i sort of miss the unique feeling of playing each game
which is fine
like today you can just pick up any game and know how to play it just fine
because i think it's sort of fun when every game makes you go through a completely unique learning curve as to how to play it
i also am pretty sympathetic towards control and gameplay oversights
yeah but they are still good
because they are masters of making games that hold up
especially when nintendo is concerned
i definintly disagree
dkc64, dkc, dk, then proably dktf
best dk games
its okay
well dkc returns is not a good game
yeah it was aparently very good
neither do i
and then I'll lend it to you
or buy it for me
and just borrow it
or wait until I have it
and it'd be cool
and have it
or you could just buy it as a book
its very graphical
and the art is really cool
considering its a cool ass story
still worth 10
which is a lot
I'm going to marry the itallian grad student who is writing her discertation on european erotic comics
its about the dude who made it, and how he went crazy
<:curse:248225815005757442>
nvm
you are just trying to piss me off
it is a narrative
lol
big difference
these are pictures
those are prose
its 256 pages so it's definitly worth the price
it got good review
you should
unlike a normal wishlist
but it actually says if it was purchased
i don't know
https://www.amazon.com/wedding/keenan-may-the-void-bloomington-december-2016/registry/31BQ3Q44I523Z
lol
sorry
It's me
I honestly really admire it
into
im so inot that
I'm upset though mac, because after the 100th video he really increased the production quality and I feel like it ruined a lot of the tonality
what is this 2015?
lol ben
He makes sure I don't sin
I always have his videos playing in the background while I do homeowr, that way I stay on track
this is my favortite channel
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmrXakd_r6I
good album
also, I really like So Jealous
no i think it's creepy as hell
https://youtu.be/CwGt8qutBA8?t=4m40s
you need to go to bed
guys
yup
playing cute shit like that all the time
yeah now you know what made mac and keenan the way they are
what game
I agree with the dk64 idea for remake
shadow of the colossus is a good remake
go to bed and stop watching dunkey
<:curse:248225815005757442>
join call my dude
I wonder how large of a size that works with
I mean to be fair though his acomplishments in the medical field far outweigh his failures
*shhhhh*
yeah and because he doesn't want to ruin his career
yeah saw that
i guess do too
lol
well we tried
@everyone  MY CHILDREN....RISE!!!
are you going to bed now?
you know it's just you and me right?
Not from excitement but because it reminds me that I'm an entire generation older and still play video games.
Every time I think about next gen consoles I get really anxious.
get the rest wired
either way it doesn't matter
ask them to wire you the remainder
give them a check for 1,400
easily
hes a no nosense boy
lol
if you sell all the games its not a bad deal
https://bloomington.craigslist.org/vgm/5873892133.html
you see this asher?
will do
so i can only make it on time cycling
just because i only have two classes, they are just very far apart start back to back
cool yeah I would just need it from like 11-2
no but i can buy one
honestly I only need a bike for friday
I'm hoping whoever tries to sell my bike on craigslist
I may take you up on that, probably not tonight but likely tomorrow
ballentine
my bike was stolen
one of my friends lives really close to campus so I think I'm just going to park at her place
lol
make sure it is :curse:
only if you do it
lol
any of ya'll have a spare bike i could borrow for the week?
It's well organized but not browsable
I'm fine with Spotify, it's just not browsable
I'll get that
K
Hmm
Spotify has offline capability which is nice, but I don't really need it if I'm going to have an mp3
I just really can't decide between Spotify and YouTube.
Especially since I'm getting an MP3 player in like 6 weeks
What's another google thing I could buy?
Nvm that looks dumb
What's a google home?
I wish youtube red gave student discoutns like spotify
and isnt as browsable for finding new music i feel
i would get spotify but spotify doesnt have as much music that i like
no i would only use it for music
I'm not using my hulu
do you guys think youtube red is worth it
they don't know how to spell at IU
french
I'm really excited for all my spring classes
so excited
I just torrented every superman comic from 1938-2008

most of my amazon wishlist is art books that are between 100-200
same with most art books
so most of the price is in the printing cost
and has a lot of rare scans and articles specific to it
and 4 inches deep
its 16 by 21 inches
so yall should get it
http://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/75-years-of-marvel-comics-roy-thomas/1120316132/2671022677518?st=PLA&sid=BNB_DRS_Marketplace+Shopping+Books_00000000&2sid=Google_&sourceId=PLGoP3401&k_clickid=3x3401
update: it went down in price
geniunely one of my favorite possesions
tbh though marvel did this and it was 300 and its fucking awesome
If nintendo did this, it would be 100 and way better
im sure it does
I don't know
i need to put together an apple trailer bingo card
"a chronicle of modern innovation"
"truly an experience"
same thumbnail from every apple video
its iCoffeetablebook
its modern
its crisp
its sleak
this is not just some book
ronald
hahaha
so retro, yet modern
inovative
trully inoative
a book
for all those glossy jpegs
well now i have to get it
for shit exactly like this
I love apple
:firty:
ive been super busy...thinkin' about you
i missed you
also hi ronald
of death
a 20 ft banana peel
not one thats has shroud tentles, like a motherfucker
not a 20ft mother fucker
not a giant motherfucker
someone needs to make a pokemon off of this boy
jellyfish
it can full extend to around 36
thats 20 feet long

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stygiomedusa_gigantea
i also liek youll be back
i like blown us all away
yeah
yeah
bad
i want a burger
a rich history of no jump button
no
just watch a longplay at 1.5 speed
why would you do that to yourself
dont do nes 2
so i can finally beat inside story
we should sync it so i can get in on that
i feel like that wouldn't interfere with anything
you should play at least 30 minutes of zelda a day
oh
what marathon?
i need to get a working copy of sunshine
we need to get tri force heroes to have all the zelda games between us
do you have four swords and link to the past?
so between the two of us we own every zelda game besides tri force heroes
you own majora?
lol
yeah but you love the music
doesn't diminish it
its the same reason why you can love spiderman without having read a single comic
that's what makes them so cool
lol you shouldn't zelda games are rich in lore and music that allows you to appreciate them without even playing
I mean you are not much better mac
zelda is one of those things that you can definitly be a fan of without actually doing
i mean think about all the earthbound games
there are so many of those
lol
they are the same age

yeah, because they are anime characters
mario is only 45
kid link
link is only 7 dude
because thats a right of passage
never gorget
so much love
yeah
not the boss
i think she's a boss
who does bad things
he's a good guy
but giovani just wants to stop mewtwo
lol
but the grunts are just kids
well giovani is supposedto e a mobster
which is cool that they actually refined it and pulled it off
thats what rocket was supposed to be
skull, flare, rocket, aqua, plasma, magma, galaxy
and the game hasnt even come out yet
team skull is already my favorite team
look at that fucking devious mustache
and just pet it every day
and never leave
and have my dark rattata
I'm just going to be the aloan version of joey
but there are so many pokemon that need love
I honestly don't think im every going to get past the first gym
perfect
oh okay
as opposed to?
lol
lol literally skyrim but with mario
and a retail nightmare
that'd be a marketing nightmare
then you could get a bunch of pokemons
just sell your house ben
:s: to create a spoiler cover over the text :s:
is a spoiler tag
that's another feature discord needs
lucky
but one if you are lucku
also this is the first time i've liked every starter since 4th gen
but i genuinely am hype aboutover half
like most the time im hyped about like 25% and indifferent to the rest
This is the first time there are more pokemon that i like than not
Ugh perfection.
Like I just want a team of beautiful water ladies to use after my 6 orangurus mindwipe the entire e4
Feebas
Because if I can't have a prismarine and milotoc I'm going to be pissed
I'll look at launch.
Feel as better be in this fucking game
Which sucks because that's my starter.
No I don't want to look.
I saw that one by accident
And torterra would just be the earth
Mega empoleon would just literally be Neptune
Mega infernape
I mean I feel like it's nice to take a break.
Because they can always come back to it in the gen 4 remake
For sure
Lol
That shit would be dope
If only you could combine a mega evolution and z move
I love how they took my favorite thing about mega evolutions which is going through the transformation just to wreck a lvl 3 zubat and made it 100x better
http://petrichorsummers.tumblr.com/post/153215000936/windvain-rbookbakes-world-of-tazcraft
lol
I just hate doing anything in browsers
disgusting
she said its because shes to lazy to download word
not even notepad
fucking text edit
for the last 5 years
so i met this girl who has been only using text edit to write her papers
ew
lol why
because i use the client
I never open google drive
maybe they recently mass allowed it, I'll have ot check
but on the desktop you need it approved my an admin
yeah
which isn't compatible yet with umail
i just prefer to use inbox
no i have
I check the weather a lot

lol


the fuck facebook
lol
its just the opposite of whatever edition you have
yeah i have no doubt
that they are evil and team school is bad but still kinda good?

HYPE TRAIN
`FUCK
lol
and then ill have more time because you will be playing twilight
by the time you finish ocarina it will be thanksgiving break
what if I made you a portable n64
i have to think it over
...i don't know
not as your first experience
the 3ds version i'd only recomend if you are looking to replay
don't do both
mac you'd be missing out on this
everyone is so fucked up in their design
and there is something about the original chracter models that also add to this
the cool part of majora is that is suppose to be a distorted reality, so the n64 version makes that feel so much more legit
they chose to make everything real
yeah but they chose not to
it will be, but it wont be the same, youll be dependant on the narrative to and music
because rathern than a good background that makes your feel grounded and secure, there are so many surrealist enviroments that make you feel uneasy as fuck
like its how they created a mood with the technical limitations where all the cool shit comes from
its the dynacism
No dawg
this literally sums up the difference of tones

but mac it changes SO MUCH
yes
the graphics are definitly comprable
its only mechanically better
no
its not
but you cant just watch it in 10 minute intervals
you dont have to marathon it all at once
think of it like a triliogy of a movie
literally only 4 dungeons
you gotta play it in like 2-3 sittings
it diminishes the sense of adventure
2) you shouldn't be playing majora in short segments
1) majora is really short
orignial majora doesn't even look bad
YA GOTTA
you gotta mac...
ugh you are killin' me
its the entire game dawg
üò¶
and now its not as creepy
the 3ds version fixed some of the creepier parts
no seriously though, it is part of the experience
yes
you gotta play majora first on the n64
DONT
NO
you have to beat ocarina first though
everything else I don't reall ycare about
honestly i just want to watch you play twilight and majora
because you know i hate myself some youtubers
or watch youtubers
that way idont have to replay it on my own
and i want to watch you play twilight princess
I love you
but mac
yup
you can still play it at my place
so i can watch
you should do it at my place
because then ill have to play them
so don't get me any steam games for my birthday or christmas
lol
I fucking love that game
it makes me so sad that mall tycoon isnt on steam
I want to minimize the tools i have that can distract me
I haven't talked with sam in a while
i decided not to buy it
I may honestly just hold off and just play tycoon again
but it's at least something different
It also scares me because I don't think it could possibly be a better game than rct3
but then it apparently picked up in the beta
I'm scared because the alpha reviews were really bad
k
for sure
I'm gonna get it
yeah
you know how i feel about amusement park sims right?
because i know how much you love yourself some tony hawk
or used to i guess
you also probably by all the neversoft games then
lol
I know that's your shit
uncharted
I know what a big crash bandicoot fan you are
naughty dog
that was my feeling about the first one too but i got it for 20
I just don't think it is a $60 game
like not you
I wouldn't buy it though
I liked the first one
I thought it was
yeha
and that game i actually did basically beat before launch
we got dishonored 2 a week early
yeah if reviewers already got copies it is very possible we could get it wednesday
fuck
...
yeah im leaving class early to go to a meeting
this is literally the main reason I wanted to work at a game store
yeah
thursday
i dont think the meeting should be very long so im thinking if its there i can get it to you by around 7
That'd be a great story for your kids
lol
actually thats not true, I have a meeting at 5 but immeditely after that
two copies
but basically my boss gets off at 5 so at 5 im going to go steal a copy
i mean again this is obviously only if it comes in thrusday, which it could also come in tomorrow
lol k
btw you want moon right?
and I'm done only catching hoot hoot
because i always play at night
and why i always set my clock 12 hours different
that was my least favorite part about gen 2
that's perfect
and she's not wrong
my cousin who is going with me is super exicted that i'm going because she knows i will know where all the fun weeb shit is
I've already set aside time to go to the pokemon center
I also want to get a japanese gameboys
If it is I'm so buying it there
basically japan
yeah, so i want to buy a shit ton of electronics while i am there
visitng family
tokyo specifically
I'm going to be in japan during spring break
k because guess what
do we know the date?
what is the switch launch date?
oh also mac
coming out with new virtual boys
yeah mac, nintendo is too busy innovating
like valve
with any frequency
only pleb game companies patch their games
exactly
was just thinking that
lol
"speed run" potential
to them every bug after launch is a feature
nintendo aint about those patches though
lol
a delayed game is better than a bad game
in the paraphrased words of miyamota
gotcha, well that's unfortunate
what makes you think it wont be ready by launch?
i thought you meant a bundle title, nvm
i misunderstood what you meant as launch title
no
and are safe
mario games tend to sell well over time
yeah but mario generally isnt as much of a immeadite seller as zelda is
because everyone that wants to buy a switch are the kind of people who would buy a switch, and the kind of people who will buy zelda will buy zelda
they can't make money off of a launch title, a launch title should only be further incentive, not the primary, otherwise it minimizes your potential profit
what the point then of making it a launch title?
and want it to do well
theyve put a shit ton of resources into that game
that's the game whose sucess they are most banking
exactly
I mean why would nintendo ever make botw a launch title?
It's not like you won't just buy it
Lol
Wonder how long it took to get shut down.
Not great.
His dad was the best part
Lol
Lol
That was hilarious because we both didn't really want to go to the game or go to Cody's.
Yup I was so happy we got out of that
We almost had a sleepover with Cody.
Surreal
That shit was crazy
Hey Ben.
Remember that time we went to a basketball game?
That actual face when you need to send something to yourself but you email isn't working

I've honestly decided not to look at anything sumo related until launch.
No
because that saves time
I mean as an adult I am happy
yup
yup
Water colors
Skyrim
I also made a Mudkip while I was waiting for the colors to dry

That's just an old photo
No
Also that's the beauty of cartooning
I imagine it as something like this but more well kept

that's why i used it

I'm still pissed at you mac
because the vets in town didn't know
I had to call specialist
i vomited
like if someone dropped you from a 4 story buidling
she literally looks like she was broken in half
I talked with some vets and they said if she lives 24 hours she will likely completly recover
they are like dolphins
I left the lid open
I'm just drawing now if you want to chat
tegan and sara has been putting me in a better mood by the wayt
thanks
She's bleeding, mucus is coming off of her and she has was is either broken bones or nerve damage.
Or both.
Somehow she was alive outside of her water for what must have been hours.
She's in water now but she does not look good
My favorite axolotl killed herself last night...
Like we need send reciepts because when ronald is online I have no idea if he is actually reading the chat or not
k
I'll add it to my watch list
I promise I will listen to it if you send me a link
I will but i can't do homework with lyrics
no
you have any albums for me though?
I can't I gotta try to finish up some over due stuff tonight
k
im sure its been posted before
i feel like you could turn it or off.
facebook has it in their messager
not really
read reciepts
you know what the net feauture discord really needs?
lol
lol
nice
or their thing?
did you do photoshop
nice
did it feel responsive?
how is the pen mac?
his is that yeah
yup
picture?
i imagine it is
lol
Like 7-10 bucks I think it's worth.
I think it is worth the cheapest tickets
That's difficult.
Hmm
The plot is generic
Very surreal
The fx are amazing
Lol
I just fixed 10 Pokemon games.
I'm a fucking god
Or video games obviously.
I was never very much into them, I usually played a lot more with stuffed animals or my sister's toys
Philip was so into bionicles
Lol
I'm very excited to see how my african american literaure course goes today
http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/10/13584442/nintendo-wii-u-production-japan
Eric is hype for it
Yup
üòâ
vroom vroom
üëÜüèø yes
Asher we should pool our money and buy a truck
lol and get really into guns
what a lil' boy
I'm very much against guns, but I'm also against any form of violence so I don't really represent a realistic viewpoint
lol
just get tenitus
did you cry?
it scared me so much
it was a starting pistol
I heard a gunshot once and i cried
no
lol
I wonder if they do black friday deals on GUNS
fair trade for fun i think
Ill sell my ps4 to get a gun
I thought theyd be like 20 bucks
guns are fucking expensive
fuck nvm
WE GONNA BUY GUNS
lol
is it sad that i can't tell the difference from the air guns and the real guns on the walmart page?
In Indiana, no license or permit is required to purchase any gun; the state doesn't require the registration of guns; and there are no limitations on assault weapons.
The state had a seven-day waiting period before a gun purchase, but that was dissolved in 1998.
wanna buy a fucking rifle?
oh nvm thats for rifles
no 18
unless you have been convicted of any felonies i should know about
apparently in the state of indiana we can just buy them
doubt it
I don't fucking know
...
K, I can drive us to walmart this weekend
Asher do you want to buy a gun with me?
yeah, I also wonder if he evolved from wolves or from Kelly students
Like I like thinking that natural mutations made this perfect beast
Asher I like to think about what sort of mutations occurred to make party god
Nice
I watched the trailer though, it looks really cool.
Yeah we missed the order deadline by a couple of months.
That's my kink
K
I've always wanted to masturbate in a freezer
What happened big dick?
Internet
I'd have to get it custom made
<@!127535721857679362>  I want to get this poster for you so you can have one thing hung up in your room.
i dont understand how people can do that shit
woodcuts are so fucking cool
but i dont want that
maybe next election
i mean i wasn't expecting my grandma to text me
k
but when i feel asleep it still hadn't been decided
i mean its not like i didn't know who was going to win anyway
all about who own
I woke up this morning with 5 messages
I don't know if Philip had found out yet
I got it spoiled for me
and asking us why art matters
my comics profressor is literally crying right now
like "that guy"
I have one class left, and I'm just going to be on my computer the whole time
yeah
Because the instructor was "not in an emotional place to teach right now"
So in my French class we just watched a movie
mac im so excited for majora
well boys if there are any shares you want to buy, now is the time
start chugging water now
lol
poor connor prickle
terrible beds for sex
I remember sleeping on one with another person for 6 months
i remember them well
this is america
he should be able to sleep ini it
because ben has a house
nc candidates
jesus the difference between Cooper and McCrory is 2000
I mean I couldn't drive, but I'm definitely just buzzed now.
Yeah I'm fine.
i just had around 6-7 shots of whiskey
I love you
lol
just hard cider?
what did you drink?
lol
Spoilers
No spilers
Marshalene is so hot
Lerfect
I'm watching a Fiona and cake episode.
Same.
<:keenan2:232323726870446080>
Fuck...
I just get passionate.
I didn't mean to be a dick
I'm genuinely sorry.
It'll all be over tomorrow.
Because I have suppressed political rage that I take out on people.
Not for that last part, that last part was true
Sorry
It's okay mac, at least you aren't Asian
Liquor
Liquor is great
lol I'm already drunk
Time to break out the liquor
That's a good idea.
I just stress smoked half a pack
Oh no I guess I must still be on from last time
Closed what?
God dammit I took a peak
üòë
I need to not know
You fool
Shh don't say anything
Because you are just going to listen to it on loop?
K
Lol
It's pretty fucking good.
Have you heard of this "adventure time" show?
Hey asher
I also think they are pretty crappy
K
doing all these anatomony studies is making me feel things.
I really need to learn how to draw women
It's funny to because I've seen that Nancy strip 1000 times.

Thank you asher for giving me the tools i need to appreciate this
until i marry masuda
every year ill just get closer and closer
There is like a 99% it'll be here by Thursday afternoon though.
Same
Assuming it actually ships on time
And no ones going to think to check to see if the games are actually in there
I'm just going to take the cartridges from the case and put the cases in the hold bin so no one sells them.
Why not?
Steal it
Which is dumb but whatever.
Imma just steak it
Eric said I can't midnight release it
As in steals copy and pay for it the next day
I guess.
If we get it Thursday I'm going to try to sneak it out before.
Immediately
I'm considering selling another game to pay for it but I can decide which one/s
Between that and the strange tickets we should be even
Ik
Mac I just sold Mario maker and got enough for moon
oh boy
lol
hopefully its in the pokedex
(i didn't even know dugtrios could be bald)
(wow dad, you are so old)
Kids not only was I alive to see the creation of dugtrio, but also when they gave him hair
best gen ever
thats fucking bonkers
lol
and smeargle ruined it
lol
lower pp?
how  so
protect moves are so integral to the meta that there is no way they would make z-moves fully blocable
or in the case of eevee something that makes eevee viable
its suppose to be a finishing move
if it just negated that no one would use them
because you can only do it once per battle
else it would suck
it would have to
yeah dawg
eh, it was necessary
with six gen buffing poison type it makes sense to nerf the strongest poison typ ein the game
eh
that earthquake immunity was too much
that makes sense
lol
what happened with gengar then?
As long as there are new cute pokemon for me to pet I don't care
k
i think im done w competitive
k
k
about time
has leech life actually been buffed?
or corocoro
and this isnt officially revealed
because the games not out yet
both
no
also im cancelling my hulu at the end of the month, so if there is anything you want to watch, now is your chance
k
Whichever has oranguru
no spoilers
Gg Nintendo
Uhhuh
K well let me know when you temporarily are at my skill level
I would love to have a friend who was equal at smash with me.
All the people I play with are either way worse or way better
Let me know when you get good
Lol
Because primarina is a beautiful girl
I think I'm going to go home.
Nope nvm got real excited there for a sec
Is sun and moon THIS Friday?
Wait
Good thing my seal princess is perfect in every way.
lol, the first think on google suggestions that pops up for decidu is "decidueye stats"
lol
that way you dont get 5 copies of the same book
and once something is bought it would automatically delete off of there
basically all you would need is a wishlist that once sent out by the user is no longer viewable by that account
just online
yeah because basically all im talking about is a wedding registry
lol
that way you could send it to multiple people, and not have to worry about them getting you the same thing
my problem with the wishlist is i wish there was a way for it to be group edited without the person finding out
same
I don't know why but putting things on my wishlist always feels more final than it actually is
https://amzn.com/w/331K190M4QFLX
lol
if you tape them together its basically the switch
yes
which is very possible
not if the deal is for the day
for your other pocket
ive done this before]
yeah
3ds
we honestly need to wait in line at target for black friday
id be happy

If i had a 3d printer i would have figurines fucking everywhere
lol
3d printing buddy
defninitly the grey one
hmm
ugh overwatch is so cool
look at how badass this one is https://www.amazon.com/Overwatch-Zenyatta-Icon-Spray-Shirt/dp/B01HP24UJM/ref=cts_ap_1_vtp?_encoding=UTF8&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=2601945442&pf_rd_r=G0ZTK86Q2N3PSV69H1E9&pd_rd_wg=yEsze&pf_rd_s=desktop-detail-softlines&pf_rd_t=40701&pd_rd_i=B01HP24UJM&pd_rd_w=nAq58&pf_rd_i=desktop-detail-softlines&pd_rd_r=G0ZTK86Q2N3PSV69H1E9
that reminds me, i have to remember to buy everyone's christmas presents once amazon does their black friday thing
<:ronnieboy:232336989989371904>
yes
because they just look good on their own
if i had that zenny shirt, that and my batman t would be the only graphic t's i would wear
ill settle for a sn controller then
k
you could buy me kazio
or...
not hard mario levels that are stupidly designed
I just want hard mario levels that are well designed
yeah but it wont be the same...
no that's kinda the major difference
i wont be able to play most of the wii u courses
but mac
lol whatever mac
it wont
nope
it will just be portable, which makes up for it
the 3ds version will not be just as good
also mario maker uses nsm mechanics which im not a fan ouf
i dont have a wii u mac
as the rom hacks
also the 3ds version wont be nearly as good
i actually just want the kazio mario, because its famous
thats not an excuse
Also i need something to hold me over until the 3ds version comes out...
there are so many rom hacks i could just download and play
but it would be cool to have it on a cartrige
because 99% of mario maker levels suck
ugh no
including the glitches
because mario maker doesnt have all the stuff from smw
yeah but they have elements that mario maker doesnt have
xhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv9k2L1OrtQ
I mean doesn't this look fun mac https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv9k2L1OrtQ?
and plenty of people have bought them
they guy who makes them is a speed runner I follow
its not sketch
because i think the cartrige is a lot cooler
i just want to play kazio mario, and I dont want to buy a usb controller
nah
ie they just use old sn cartriges
considering they are "hand crafted"
there just arent too many of them
its pretty legit
nah, I looked into it
of some of the hardest mario levels
its a cartridge of a rom hack
https://retrogamerryan.com/game.php?gameid=kaizo-mario
do you know what you should get me for my birthday?
mac
LOL
who the fuck is talking about the genesis though?
LOL
<@!71716577669550080>  apparently Benedick cumbersnatch played dormamu
K
i could buy it then sell my ds for 150
its cheaper than any 3ds
yup
make a profit
i could buy one and sell my xl
fuck
https://youtu.be/2lg8DPuBZhk
on the same console
this was 2006-2011

i mean...
but I figure I will be ready for ow
I have no idea where I will be then
okie dokie
sorry
<:sadboy:230133848740986891>
I was distracted by witch talk
oh, okay sorry
want to play 9:30-10
so it seems like more
we just talk to mac more than we talk to you
you definitly do it more
that's not true
Mac you cant just come online and not answer my question
...
...
...
more like psychological thriller, with puritans
but it's good
yeah, its not really a horror movie
thats why i'm only asking for half an hour
I really like that movie
yes
do you want to play overwatch betweel 9:30 and 10 mac?
It was the Eye of Agamotto
it is 87% global warming, 13% Al Gore
I feel like it doesn't
It's fucking 6:30 and dark as fuck outside, does this happen every year?
no
*fun fact: the Silver Surfer is Stan Lee's favorite Marvel character*
That one song is better than the concept of the silver surfer as a whole
this better be a beta mix
coo
or like the full content
are scary becuae you dont know what you are drinking
my problem is that the drinks that taste good
mac
actually it tastes like candy
its okay make its like 90% cider
that is mixed with cinnamon
but like a specifc brand
whiskey
Asher I need to have you over sometime for fireball and cider
eeeeeeeeeeeee
"say hi"
dooooooo
"lilly say hi"
mac im heading out early
have you beaten your game yet?
mac does
im 90% sure it is isabel
nah

so you can all play dota then
i'm leaving in like an hour
does anyone want to play a couple games of ow with me first though?
I do
thanks
WHAT IS MY HULU PASSWORD AGAIN
MAC
A lot of the hordes battles were very clearly designed to be annoying.
Lol
It's technically vertigo, but yeah
idk just the differnences at different times, and the failures and successes of both
weird
it probably was
Also <@!125452744440938497> did you mean Thomas Merton?
but her invis, isnt an actual invis
she will still be very powerful
thought
turns out sombra isnt as broken as I though
lol
I'm sure asher wants to play dota
lol
I've got to talk to someone
can't
do you remember like what it looked like at all?
probably wasn't zen mind...
and I doubt it was ismael
I know it wasn't flow or saviors which is what I lend out the most
hmm, that's pretty broad
I realize I have so many books missing from lending them out and forgetting about them
I have a vague recollection
do you remember the subject matter at all?
im hoping you do too
Your sister looks like a younger younger you
Your dads got bulk.
Agreed
And a bigger you
I saw your dad asher and got scared
I think of all the characters so far (besides junkrat obviously) I'm most sexually attracted to her
shit thats the best one yet
pics?
lol
that arent lucio
i mean i feel like that is true with 100% of overwatch characters
wonder what that rage in and for how long
yikes
I just saw the video
okay, is her set released?
oh
which is kinda cool
I also think her tp is going to be her ult
I'm thinking she's gonna be hella squishy and slow though
cloaking and tp is too much together
especially that tp ability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu-Y8hSYQcA
wy arent we talking abou this?
We've never played fallout together.
I cancelled a date.
So I get to play all day
üò¶
I'm doing a messiah run

anyone want to play something tonight, this is the only night i have free until monday
Well considering he has my name and knows around where I live I say I'm more susceptible to any curses than mister Richard Weed.
It's the curse
For years I will have to wonder if every bad thing that happens to me is just happenstance or if...
But also I mean this guy just screams scammer
Yeah
Ricky
The woman has a Facebook page that was made this year with only one friend.
Two he told us to transfer the money under the name and adress of this woman
Well one he gave me his name when we started messaging
Did you read the court case?
Thanks Mac
lol
okay, I look at some pairs then tonight
"sonically interesting"
i only listen to music at home
it doesn't matter to me, they don't need to be portable
no more than 100
do you have any headphones on amazon you would recommend
I will listen to them while I play fallout today
k
lol
they are literally us
shit just googled them
tegan and sara?
http://cleastrange.co.vu/post/152688120338/ghost-phage-hanzo-no
yeah, not great
lol
TBH if he finds me in Facebook he will know where I work
Lol
People threaten people all the time, I doubt he is actually unstable enough to commit.
Either way he's not local
He's not.
He's in Tennessee.
Although to be fair, it does seem he only started doing this since around august, so maybe this is the first time.
And considering this is probably makes most of his income, I can't imagine this is the first time he's dealt with this.
I'm more certain the fact that there's no way in fuck he would actually drive six hours just to potentially beat the shit out of someone that may or may not be there, when he is clearly poor and disabled.
and his personality
hey, I honor his commitment.
our ol' boy ricky just really wanted himself a wii u
it was probably legi
nah
well, it was nice knowing you guys
I'm more impressed though with the guy in the wheelchair who stabbed him
dude beat the shit out of a guy in the wheelchair
http://www.tsc.state.tn.us/sites/default/files/hopsonrickyopn.pdf
i'm going to get sexually murdered
now i'm not just going to get murdered
http://www.homefacts.com/offender-detail/TN0033150320160119/Ricky-Lynn-Hopson.html
guess what ronald, guess what wrath you summoned on me
oh guess what ronald
lol
what if he is an ordained voodoo doctor ronald, DID YOU EVER THINK OF THAT?!
lol, ill admit it finally got interesting when he started the curses
lol
so he knows what town I like in and my full name, which is more than enough to find me
my name, and the po box
I mean worst case scenario, I die
this is where you need to quote bible verses
I wonder how hard it is to find my address online though
so...I don't think he will be making any drives
anyway if everything about him is legit (which it very may well not be) he is both not from here, and is disabled
did he just google image curse?
what even is that fucking picture
ronald i'm so fucked, thanks
he's breakin' out the curses
oh shit

ronald thats where you need to be "jk ricky, you know your'e my boy"
this man looks like mac's dad from its always sunny
why
why
why
jesus ronald
you gotta have more than 1 friend
this boy don't know how to make a fake facebook
leah morgan is a fake profile made my our old boy ricky
so so i just looked ronald
lol
but since it isn't his he actually just lost all that money
see its funny though because if he were legit, he would have just cancelled the check
this is not hilarious, and i will get killed
honestly though, I honor their personality
just know it was your fault
what if i get killed in my sleep tonight ronald
"I honor my personality"
seriously though, did anyone fucking watch that?
but is doing this with 400 other people right now
a hornets nest filled with some fat guy in akron ohio who just wants his money
that shit was crazy
so did anyone watch the world series last night
thats so much to do

"Hey guys let's just be weird as fuck this year"
I feel like Nintendo is having a weird year in there development team
Yeah Ronald that's fine
Lol I hope that is totaka in that suit
Games
I really think Nintendo is missing out my not capitalizing on the potential of animal crossing outside gsmed
lol
Yeah
Maybe gencon
I don't think I would go to e3 unless I was getting paid to cover it or something.
Nintendo = entertainment.
Chicago comic and entertainment expo
Because it's c2e2
Funimation os always there.
So was Sony.
Or at least Nintendo was there last year.
Both
There will be booths that specialize in fedoras
That's not a joke.
So lots of fedoras
Because anything a nerd would buy will be there.
It makes the Nintendo store look like the toy aisle of target
Especially all the nintendo merch
I think you will think it is super neat though.
Yup
I was really hoping I could invite some hot babe...but that's really just a fantasy
You'll just play the whole time.
Lol
Oh right
NS?
You can also meet the punisher
I'm 65% going this year to have him touch me before he dies.
You can meet Stan lee with me
Comic con
April 21-23
Someone needs to come with me to c2e2 this year though.
And I'm going to be there for c2e2
Because they were hella cheaper.
Sorry I bought tickets for April.
Teehee
lol I just bought tickets
Like probably since wicked
It's one of the best musicals to come out in a long time.
They have orchestra center seats though for 469
Terrible seats
273
I just found a ticket for 290
Definitely
To see Hamilton?
Cheapest for that day is 371
K
Okay.
Cheapest tickets are $315
We'll help a brother out
The 8 pm?
What time
Day
What dat
Can I invite myself for my birthday?
And you didn't tell your best friend?!
When?!
Mac details
Macs just visiting the gravesite
When.
Can I come.
I'll pay.
What?!
We haven't even committed a joke yet
Mac
I really don't understand why this is so funny to you max
If it does send I should text him and be like "phone was hacked, if you get any messages saying they are me DO NOT LISTEN"
This is bad
Wow
Not yet
That picture of you with dicks for nipples
Guy's just trying to make a livin'
Yeah but there's a minimal amount of caring.
And I could transfer a penny with the memo "fuck you"
I was considering saying i cashed it just so he could give me his account
Lol
Yeah I cashed the check.
And then be like whoops sorry wrong number.
I should just send a copious amount of sonic porn
Lol
Lol
Justification for being an asshole
That's true.
This is what you've always needed
Go ahead
*zzzssst* you're breaking up *zsssstttt* going *zsstttt* tunnel.
I'd rather just leave him hanging.
Nah
Lol
So sad

Because it's the only place there's enough vacant space
I keep my phone in my boxers
Yeah probably not a lot this weekend
Maybe
You should really do it while trying not to kill anyone.
k
have you done the covenent quest?
ronald
why is architecture so fucking hard to draw
k
thank you kindly, please deposit, thank you.
Kind.
Deposit
too bad its not about drawing pineapples

you'd do fine, but you'd hate it
lol I would love to see you in an art class
but early christian texts are so much harder to read than ancient greek
i reckon they'd both have the same amount
lol yeah take the greek philosophy class
because those two are very different
actually is it a class on christian philosophy or is it an introdcution to christian studies
take the greek philosophy
ronald honestly though, if you want an opinion one someone who knows both you and those subjects
lol
most of ancient greek philosopher's completely align with your utilitarian bullshit
ronald you don't even know what that is
but honestly greek philosophy would be way easier for you an jesus
both are pretty bad for you

<:ronald:230126993008623616>












(you must be this tall to learn about jesus)
ronald i dont think you are mature enough for that yet
lol
gotcha yeah that could be good for networking purposes i supose
your thing seems like it should be an aspect of google calendar
gotcha
other than like lectures i guess
but what sort of events of that scale do the attendance really matter?
lol
so like when you sync a device with netflix
ah
how does it know the people were actually there?
i still don't understand the use
I really like the design thoug
but thats probably because i never work with groups
i don't understand the use
yeah
so is speeding
ronald we should start a scammin' business
so its not like he will actually do anything
and the thing about scammers is that they do this on a mass level
i mean i know he isn't local
yeah
that's craigslist
oh well
yup
tbh thats a pretty clever scam
yeah, this sort of thing happens all the time
the physical check itself is not criminal
i already ripped it up
nah i haven't invovled myself in anything
cool, now i feel better about not responding
and have the remainder wired to them
apparently people steal checks, have them sent to buy something random write a check for more than it is worth
because i was just looking through a warning thread online to see if this has happened before
the check is stolen
fuck
do you think i should
hmm
so all he knows is my name and that i live in the 812, which is honestly enough to murder me
its under her name, and we don't have the same last name
i had it sent to my great grandma's po box that she never uses
lol i didn't give my address
that's my scam
jokes on him, I made him play for the express delivery fee on the check
i just got that text
okay, yeah this is too shady, I'm ripping this thing up
noooooope
which i looked up to see if it was a scam
stockcross finacial services
also the check is from an investment service, not a personal account
I don't think they'd mail me a check for a prank.
Plus there are ways of validating an accounts funds before fully depositing it so that doesn't happen
I think the money is legit, but whatever they want me to do with it is not.
Because if you pay for services with company money that's more problematic than giving someone money to do it for you.
I fill like what it is is that they are using me as a tax free way to transfer funds out of their business.
That was the agreement that I wait for the check to fully go through.
But the thing is I asked if I could wait until all payments are confirmed
This is shady shit
Whereas i have a bmo Harris check
But I haven't given anything.
Well here's the thing.
I'd agree 100%
The fuck is this.
But said I'm supposed to transfer a portion of the funds to another account.
The person I sold my Wii U to just sent me a check for 14 hundred dollars.
Yo I think I just got my ass involved with some illegal ass shit.
i'm having a hard time not loosing it
and it literally looks like it is from the nutshack
so the cosplay chick is drawing on her tablet next to me
You gotta help out ol' ronnie boy
but y'know
I will yeah
if it isn't then there is no way for us to get t
yeah I'll try to remember to check ingram to see if that is available through there
oh i just looked it up, I see
but if it's like a day one edition then yeah
ingram doesn't get those
if its a special preorder edition than no
today's his day off anyway
what's that
what you need, because i may be going into the store today anyway
saturday
no

I wonder how many old man logan's there are going to be
when i think about xmen, I am only spooked 65% of the time
lol
65% spooky with 87% uniqueness on modern is "x-men"
I think it just has a set costume for every value
lol
and it gave me the fucking grim reaper
so i did the costume wizard thing and asked for a costume that was 100% spooky and 100% original
up in northern maine they are all about that pebbles life
yup
lol
flamingo
what the fuck is wrong with western monana though
where the number 1 costume is optimus prime
north platte nebraska has their shit together
i like you
well there is also no bee
because sexy bee isn't in the top ten
This is defninitly wrong
and now that we have harley, it applies to her too
that's like a law of physics

THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN HERSTORY
SHIT THE GANG IS ALL HERE
sometime i go in the really secret channel when I just want to have a nice conversation, but also what to be by myself
They are for when you want to be alone
you know i don't like it when you make fun of my parents
stop

i'm always watching
now we just need to get a picture of him to make an emoji
<:preciousboy:234377704261156865>
becuase I AM A GOOD PERSON
I already friend requested him
they truly are majestic creatures
lol
wild sighting
Fuck, Lina's Halloween costume is really good
you uh, you aren't wrong...
Lol
That's worse than being drunk
Jesus mac
Did you make the switch?
same
Also shouldn't you be having your dick sucked right now?
I don't even understand how you are still drunk.
<:sadboy:230133848740986891>
üò¶
Why my precious boy?
?
How are you kids?
Omw
I'm all for that.
Probably mass
Church
Also I know I've said this a thousand times, but I really want to start going to chuch
Well by the time we get to my place and I change and take of shit it'll probably be close to time anyway, we can just kill time by playing video games.
I close so like 10:15
Also do you want me to pick you up after work?
Is clara coming?
What are you going as?
I mean, I'm just wearing my full bee
Asher you actually bought tickets right?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=93&v=8uCEeCUecNI
https://i.imgur.com/pbUS31y.gifv
How is hack nc Mac?
I can't:-(
I fuck.
I'm legit hung over for the first time.
I legit spent like two hours talking with this chick about the Christ .
No
This seducing is so much harder than I thought.
If you get it.
I'll wear it
Lol

Lol

Asher if you buy me a ticket for the midnight I'll pay you abck


Yeah totally.
I can only go the midnight show though.
I was but I don't have anyone to go with.



Mac I'm literally at a Mario party right now
2198447
it makes me sad too, but there is no reason for me to haveit
lol if this actually pans out, I will have actually turned a profit on my wii u
im pretty sure it was a combo of the fan and the wii emulation
maybe
idk i havent had the problem before or after
should i tell them it may poop out when they play super mario galaxy?
considering they offered to pay more since it would be a hassle to have it shipped
imma gonna do it
also their number is an ohio area code, so it checks out that they aren't from here
that i mean giving out that info isnt ideal, but my name and address isnt like crazy info to give out
but i just want to make sure that im not being dumb here
fair
and changing my name and moving
and cashing the check
so what is stopping me from just not sending it
...
but they are okay with me waiting until the check clears before i send it
but says they need to name and address to mail a check, because they arent from town
so someone on craigslist is offering to buy my wii u
lol the first model of the 3ds wasnt actually 3d but just 3 screens
like honestly they probably have so much stuff in there r&d department that hasnt been touched in years that they could just sell to indie companies
that if they actually wanted to do something with could be amazing products
it makes you think of all the other prototypes they never implemented that are just sitting around
you've got to admit its pretty neat
thats crazy that they just refined their prototype
did you ever see that prototype wii u i posted?
mac
So it's that or facebook
All I have is her number
I'll try.
I'm at a thing but I already texted my gamgam
So I can get that info pretty easy.
Eh regardless my grandma sees her like every week
She's retired I thought
Yeah I got you
You want me to get her email address?
That sucks but at least she's nice and not dead.
Lol
I'd imagine.
I want to demo it first though.
I really need to limit my accessibility to distractions.
Nice
It
But I'm hoping I can find a way to get a student discount on ir
Don't know.
I think I'm going to set aside 166 a month until it comes out
I know.
I want it
<:preciousboy:234377704261156865>
MAC
"From there, it progressed to a large LCD screen with two Wii remotes attached to the sides, which was used for approximately 30 Wii U game concepts.
The second prototype turned out to be the controller that most resembles what the GamePad is today"
this article is from 2012
http://www.ubergizmo.com/2012/12/nintendo-wii-u-gamepad-prototype-once-an-lcd-with-wii-remotes-attached/
this is a wiiu prototype
HOLY SHIT
plus im including a game
I figure as long as i am undercutting game world and gamestop im fine
i mean i can always go down
so i was thinking 200
gameworld is giving 115 and it sells for 229
how much do you think i should sell it for
im gonna sell my wiiu with pikmin 3 on craigslist
then have the surface for graphic stuff
and do all my fun things on my tablet
maybe sell it, and get something cheaper
I want to downgrade my macbook, and try to use it only for writing
lol
if i pay 166 a month i can have it paid off in 18 months
like a loan from my grandparents, not like a real loan with interest
I'm gonna see if i can get a loan for the surface studio though
so thin
but asher
lol
who doesnt want that?
and a touch bar
the colors
but asher
orrect
except cosmo is so much cuter
i love the idea of this, but i think they overlooked the aspect that personality isnt doing the exact same animation everytime a certain action occurs...
https://anki.com/en-us/cozmo
thats probably the only suicide squad shirt you could get me to wear
lol
I thought about harley quinn but considering ive seen to many guys at conventions non ironically dressed as harley i decided against
fuck yeah, shit
we both should have gone as jared leto joker
Lol asher
whereas you can pull off a gothic aesthetic so there are a lot of sexy male costume options for you
without looking like a total dork
because im too tiny for literally anything else
i think this is the only sort of costume i could really pull off though
lol
fair, but i feel its are harder aesthetic to rock when seducing comes around
because it would accent your figure but you hair would emphasize your masculinity, for a nice contrast
honestly it would look so much better on you
but im pretty comfortable with my buldge
im going to be wearing spandex shorts underneath though so itll be impossible to hide it whil sitting down
im hoping it will be cold enough to keep it hidden
tutu
tutu
its really hard to hide my dick in this tutu
we shall see
no:( im just hairless


I'm gonna be so cold
we use aim now so you can't join
mac and i are actually in an aol chat messenger right now
and you aren't invited
we are talking about pokemon
he is privately messaging me
no he is ignoring you
that's what you think
MAC
OMG MAC
its hilarious to hear someone do live commentary on an 11 year old playing tetris
that's where they use to do all the mario tournaments
because that's what i was talking about last night
my mom wanted to go to one of those so bad as a kid
yup
lol
Imma join chat hold on
I'm at wkrk
I want to get more into music but I don't like having to decide what to listen to every time I'm in the mood
That seems way easier to put music onto
I'll consider that
Gotcha.
Why is it more expensive than the 8gb model?
You like it?
I was considering trying to find a cheap iPhone/iPod to have for music
I don't have space on my phone really.
Since YouTube you have to have open unless you buy red
But it's the only thing I can use Mobile
I don't like Spotify hinestly
Okay
Hmm
Asher, how do you listen to music without having to pay for it?
Lol
There are actually a lot of positions open at shitty nerd culture webzines
Yeah it would just go against everything I believe in artistically.
First I would have to learn to write...
What if I just sold my soul and got extra cash by being an entertainment writer.
After college
What is this shit
Shit I just typed comics into monster for NYC and there are actual jobs
I wonder if I talk to Michael Uslan again he would consider getting me in contact with the woman who is in charge of all the graphic brand management for DC and warner.
If I move to New York I'll have to live with...Philip
I feel like if I just sucked the right dick in the department I could get one for free
I wonder if I did another year at iu I could get a ba in graphic design.
Fair.
But that's not what companies like that are looking for.
Not really.
That's not graphic design.
Mac
That doesn't count max
I just have to hope they don't ask for a portfolio from that time.
The funny thing is after I graduate I can technically say I have 2-3 graphic design experience.
There are so many more graphic and publishing opportunities in New York than Seattle...
But then again anywhere outside central manhattan is that way
I stayed in Harlem for three weeks, it's not as bad as you would think, but yeah it's not a place for you to be alone at night.
If I lived in New York Mac, I would have every super hero
I'd have to go to like queens or Newark
The rent control there is non fucking existent.
Honestly I don't think I could afford to live in Harlem.
See asher you just have to make sure you like in the "white" shitty neighborhoods
New York rent is so much cheaper than Seattle considering is has a lot shittier areas
Also San Francisco has some great opportunities but it's impossible to afford moving there without a guaranteed career-job
I hate that Burbank has to be nice, because that fucks up the real estate
I have to look at New York and the Burbank area now though
Yeah so as long as you don't get seasonal depression you are good
But basically is about the same as Bloomington, only difference is you have more advancement opportunity, and better transportation infrastructure.
And that's just with minimum wage
That's 28,800 which far above the standard yearly cost of living in the us
Which means about 620 that can go towards leisure and savings.
So we are looking at around 1580 minimum cost of living.
And maybe 30-50 for transportation.
200 is standard for food but I only do 100
And about 150 for utilities and services
So account for about 1300 for total rent related cost
So if you work full time in Seattle at minimum wage you are bringing in about 2200 a month after tax
Which I'm not taking with ne
And the other five all live in the same tank
One of which is going to die soon
I have literally 6 pets mac
But that is for apartments half the size of most of the stuff here.
And cheapest you can get in Seattle is 800
Unless you have ties to iu
But if you want to live close you gotta spend at least 800
Cheapest you can get in Bloomington is like 400
Like you could easily get a place way cheaper in Bloomington, but not a place close to campus.
Yeah I'm talking about non iu apartments.
So I should have said Bloomington not iu
But I couldn't really afford to live at iu on my salary either.
It's honestly only about 20% more expensive than iu
Although I could be a barista and make twice as much as I make currently.
I don't understand how anyone affords to move to cities
You are qualified for a lot more of these jobs than I will ever be
Dude I'm just on monster browsing.
I'm just looking at what kind of positions people there are looking for
Within the area
Unless I have web design experience.
Yeah but all these job listing look hella competitive.
Yo Redmond is fucking expensive mac
?
Mac look up yellow magic orchestra.
I can't wait until phones become obsolete enough where I don't need one
Not bad.
How much
How much?
Just because they feel like genuine self sustaining communities that are brilliantly designed.
Honestly though the best city out of any game is either megaton or the citadel
And Pokemon only really has 8 towns which isn't that much more.
Yeah but you can spend at least 10 hours never getting bored in each town.
Whereas a Pokemon town is exhaustible in an hour or two
Like tbh skyrim only really has 7 towns
It always feels like a lot more though.
There are 7
Lol nvm
Twilight has a lot of towns
Yeah...
I wonder how many cities there will be
True.
Which honestly will be better
I can see that
Sort of like the marvel movies.
They are meant to ingrain you where you are rather than just offer an epic tune
Another thing about skyward sword though is that it's soundtrack is much more environmental as opposed to other Zelda games
True
So cosplay chick a junkrat main, so you won't have to compete with her for healslut
It isn't but it's main theme is great
i think im going to download blender and try to learn it first though
Ugh I gotta find someplace to demo this shit
and dreams has animating potential whereas medium doesnt
also ps4 has dreams which is also better than tiltbrush
maybe i should get playstation vr though, since I have a playstation
because oculus medium is so much better than tilt brush
that's true...they are the same price...
mac you should buy me a vr set
https://www.oculus.com/medium/
right now though tiltbrush is literally the mspaint of vr
so i could just walk through my house, but it would be all spooky
and make it in tandem with my house
first thing I would do, is make a haunted house
like I dont think 3d modeling will get more detailed, but I think it will be a lot easier to have detailed renderings.
So smaller game companies can invest more into their game models
neat
I could just spend all day making trees
FUCK
FUCK
you could actually create detailed face renderings
alter the size and get what ever perspective you want on it
becuase imagine if you are working on a model for a game, and you can just literally go and sculpt it with vr
but imagine if i got good a modeling with vr
no its not
i also hope sketchup or solid works is working on something
if they can make a vr compatbile photoshop, thats going to be game changing
I'm hoping adobe is working on something
itsn't tiltbursh all thats available right now?
the tiltbrush was literally made just for tentacles
TENTACLES
omg
fuck
AND THE FIRST VR PORN COMIC CREATOR
I CAN BE THE FIRST VR COMIC CREATOR
HOLY FUCK
if i got the vive i would only use it for art and porn
lol if i got a vive i would literally never play games on it
omg ronald
if i get the vive do you think i could just buy new controllers when they come out rather than a complete set?
market
talk about a niche markey
tilt is 29.99
but can't i just buy new controllers?
i can get good with the platform while they are still developing it
why?
I don't really care about the vr, I care about the software
fuck, I'm asking for a vr set for christmas
like a museum exhibit
where you literally walk from panel to panel
imagine the first vr comic book
fuck now im excited
i want it for painting too though
yeah but imagine the modeling capabilities
but it doesn't look like it could compete with literally the most basic 3d modelling software
from an innovative standpoint
and they create a specific sylus for it
i'm hoping a better platform that tilt brush eventually comes out
like, I dont see how that isn't going to be the future of 3d modeling
and walk around them
I can make giant 3d dicks
I may buy a vr headset now
so....
oh tilt brush
are you sure that is the one they did those painting videos with?
thanks
what is that google thing called?
i use 8
im very interested in that
what is that vr art thing google is working on?
figure painting is very theraputic
id help
üò¶
dota characters
metagross
but mac, you could have a figure of anything you wanted
figure painting is real easy once you know how
and it would be a lot more fun
mac you could honestly 3d print your own figures and paint them for way cheaper
üò¶
what if i paint all the marios
so if i give you 100 marios you will give me $600?
mkay
the problem is only when they go out of stock
gameworld order amiibos for 6.85
no
i have connections
secre=t
I can get you any amiibo for $6 though
and its always like 12-15
if you go to toys r us, all their amiibos are the same price
so i can buy all the figures cheap
i'm excited for disney infinity to finally die
and they are only going to make 1000
but its 400
theres a 18" wolverine statuette i want so bad
like most 1" statues though range from 60-100
and the lightsaber would be too heavy if it was ceramic
the base definitly isnt ceramic
the base and the light saber may be, i cant really tell
lol
but it just depends on the type of ceramic
i mean they are always made of ceramic
maybe a little more depending on the material
a statue one tenth the size of that would be about 200
its retail value is 2000
its life sized
id use him as a coat rack
https://midlifecrisiscrossover.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/img_5147-maul.jpg
not including the stand
nine fucking inches
5 feet
life-sized
but asher...
yup
yea
asher, want to do a timeshare on the darth maul?
k
k
think of it like a loan, but i get a nice computer rather than interest
i really don't want a computer
also mac I'm not paying 600 because i want a computer
it can run undertale at 30fps believe it or not
whereas mine does not
anyway the main thing is that it runs everything perfectly
bass
plus the soundsystem sam put together is worth it for me honestly, playing on his computer is awesome because it has such great base
ronald had to build his, and his is only more powerful because he made it this year
so he gets some extra cash rather than having to store it
and i wont fuck it up
like i said, he is giving it away, but he knows i wont play it a lot
everything
you tell me
this has the specs mac
https://imgur.com/a/9D3IT
here you go
i dont
mac his computer is better than yours
but if I have it then he always has the potential of buying it back
not that he couldn't sell it easily
i mean to be honest, I'm only really buying it to help him out
i think he spent around 16-18 hundred on it total
i think it was 250 yeah
dont remember
he put so much more money than he should have into that comptuer
its worth so much more than that
i helped him put it together
i definitly cant
its probably the nicest custom ive ever seen
you've never seen his computer
but...I do
i can't
and its better than mine
yeah i can, because I've played on it for years
"travel the world"
I don't know mac
no hes leaving for a year
considering everything is up to date, and the motherboard is brand new
hes basically giving it away at 600
because sam is selling me his pc
you should do it before I sell it
k
k
a lot of it has lyrics though mac, so you may not like it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4n3Am3J7UE
I always play this one at the store to get saucy
prob
rpg
its a game
persona 4 ost is great
gotcha
oh i see, the game is called final
nice
shit are you close to beating it?
lol
that's pretty coherent right?
it after essentially the of and the Li as no power, he into successor.
It is after Huang essentially mourns the loss of Ch√º-cheng and establishes the Wan Li emperor as having no real power, that he moves into Ch√º-cheng‚Äôs successor.
so if i just remove every other word I should be good right?
so twice the maximum length
single spaced
no more like i'm just finishing up and it is 7 pages
so my paper was supposed to be 5-7 pages...
"I brought double dash, but only one controller, so you will just all have to watch me"
"hey guys I'm here, what input would you prefer me to hook my gamecube up to?"
just so i can practice
I cant tell you how many times I've brought my snes to a party
yeah!
polietly taking turns
most parties are just a bunch of people gathered around two people playing mario kart
did no one tell you?
thats what real parties are mac
IT WILL IN MARCH
lol
karen is my perfect woman
best meme of the month
yeah, i love karen
"yeah I only get that about 100 times a day"
but maybe im just overestimating gamers
I can't imagine anyone saying that
because I guarantee no one in his real human life said that to him
I loved in that video where he was like "oh you were in the nintendo commerical?
what's it like to be famous?"
neat
i thought they got him because he was already the european captain
nvm
oh
the guy said he was captain of the european team
btw apparently that footage was from a tournament that already happened
omg a casual ninteno made moba woud be so cute
yup
which i am not ready for
as soon as I leave this town I have to actually be an adult
which is nice
but i don't have to be an adult here
ive been tired with bloomington for years
it sucks that IU has to be such a good school
that's fair
because i looked into places to work in seattle when I was accepted
i actually know for a fact that they have better game world
so they give out grants like candy
also they got all that microsoft money
but i know its a good research school
i dont know about uw for anything beyond history
get myself a rental in the area
regardless once may of 2018 hits, I'm headin' out
because he wants to
and mac can come too
so you and i can be roommates
go to university of washington
*idea*
*we never had ronald*
are you doing online stuff?
okay, now I want to do my grad whereever you go
asher what if I end up going to grad school and being an ai in one of your classes?
asher is typing
shh...
<:preciousboy:234377704261156865>
fail
to
yOU
Want
I
...
I just want salt
I'm not even hungry
and now I want fast food
I've made way more progress on this paper than I thought I would
want to get fast food with me?
i really want fastfood
someone is selling a life-sized statue of darthmaul for 700
asher
I remember I wanted one fo these so bad when i was in elementary schooll
1.
library 2.
clara.
3.
me
its has all your important contacts
asher why not just get one of these
it's like krabby patties
MAC NNOW IM JUST LOOKING AT SMARTPHONES FROM THE 2000's
THIS IS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT
GODDAMMIT
which i feel like asher would play a lot more
but its got fifa 2005
yeah that's true...
its better than skyrim
skyrim doesnt even have coop
coop skyrim
but skyrim mac
*shh*
who ever thought of that?!
on the go
literally skyrim
it even has an exclusive elderscrolls game
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Gage_(device)
it is cheaper, and you could sell your 3ds
asher i have a better option
that way i can free up pocket space
I want a phone that is a floating sentient orb
üò¶
because if so

can you get custom faceplates for it?
considering you are taking pictures on your phone, while he is just biking, i think you are in the wrong in this scenario
i fucking dare you
do it
you should
lol
awesome thanks
he already never comes back
go away ronald
asher i need ambient music to do homework to
I figured, I just wanted to make sure the fork didn't break
Mac is your bike okay?
Ah
ysac?
there are only four dungeons in majora
yeah
and majora is a short game
we got this
20 hours each
so no collector value
and i already have the origninals
no replay value
once we beat them there is no point of having them
you will just bring over your wii u
i can play them
so we can marathon them
I dont think i can sell it above 150
because right now is the most i can get for it
tonight
I'm actually probably going ot sel my wii u tingiht
then i can sell my wii u
fuck yeah
the only game i have internailized is oot and majora
becuase i dont remember anything from that
we can also do windwaker
that playing it again will be for the frist time
true but its been so long
i havent beaten it
youve also never seen me play an rpg for the first time
youve never seen me play a zelda game
because the only thing you have to be awake for is the dungeons and quests
that way we can take breaks
tag team it
we can have a marathon
such dedication
which is like 21 hours long
after youve already listent to the smash soundtrack
lol
üò¶
are you in ballentine right now?
anymore...
which is why i dont do it
yeah...
those were the days
i remember when i use to put my sp in a plastic bag when i showered
because that's the future
the gen after that should be playing in the shower
and the next gen is playing anywhere
so if the current gen of wii u is playing 15 feet from your tv
true
ik that isnt unique to the 3ds
that allows for one handed use on rpgs
except the 3ds has the l=a advantage
fair
fair
fair
is you couldn't play it with your feet?
mortal kombat is so broken
ill need to find it
have i ever shown you that video of me beating mortal kombat on hard with my feet?
probably
good *idea*
yeah which is why all the vr sets are doing it
i can spread eagle with my arms
true
is just the wii
actually not basically
except thats basically just he wii
yeah
what
now i just watch clips on youtube
even though i cancelled my subscription to get hulu
and i find entertainment in it
yup!
(i hope)
they know its bad, but they still find entertainment in it
its like how people watch reality tv
so i will watch the flash
but i like flash more
and arrow is shit
like i acknowledge that the flash is shit
i only try to get adamant about movies
anyway, I try not to champion television shows over one another because most serialized programming is garbage
gotcha
its also shit
its on its third season
izombie is not new
he does crossfit
nikhil is worse than ronald
whether or not it sucks
i mean considering i didn't hate the first season of it as much as i hate arrow, I think I will personally enjoy it
yeah
it's gotten beyond crazy
Also I really need to catch up on the Flash
morning
i did like an entire days worth of work in my first class this mrooning
yippie
and do homework
I can just work on papers
this is fantastic
but i just forgot that i could have it
none of them
this is amazing
I just realized i can bring my laptop to class
in my hypothetical dreamworld
no because they don't care about your knowledge, they just want to see how to deal with certain challenges
whereas i am bullheaded, but have great intuition
no because it would show you are careful and learn from mistakes
"the way a man plays a mario game says more about his character than a resume" - *miyamoto*
what if the interview for every nintendo job is you have to pick a nintendo game from a selection of 5 and they just analyze you while you play it
If only my love of comics was a strength at nintendo
it's like one of my top 5 dream jobs
NINTENDO
but nintendo mac
marketting would be more fun
i feel like i could do both
like how manypeople with actual marketing experience are trying to get into nintendo
i wonder how competitive the marketing is at nintendo
there are plenty of noa options
eh
and a product marketing coordinator
they are also looking for a web hosting manager
the next five years are like the perfect time to go
its like int he biggest state of economic progress right now
I want to move to washington anyway
and i can be the "dad that works at nintendo"
then i can have a kid
and then vouche for me
do it
lol
theres a little intereactive ?
block
bros?
have you seen what happens when you google search super mario bors?
omg mac
then we can follow it up with "The Adventures of the Green Hat Boy"
I think we should make a super mario bros clone called "Itallian Plumber Simulator 1985" so nintendo will contact us
snipers dressed as itallian plumbers
in which case they come down like the hand of god
yeah until you post leaks
like the fact that nintendo makes me more excited to spend my own money now than they did to spend my parent's money then really says something
because as a kid nintendo marketing was good, but nowhere near the level it is now
also reggie has made such contributions to nintendo
90s pizza hut had the best marketing
that makes sense
like all of those people in the skits make tens of millions every year
yeah
yeah, I mean what other company does that
any quake or half-life mod
yeah
that's why i said he just buys shit
no
so i dont count him
but he just buys shit
also I forgot about gaben
he's perfect
like he sits with the developers and helps focus their ideas
at least creatively
stan lee doesn't do anything, but from what i understand miyamoto still does a lot
stan lee
shit actually no
like maybe steve jobs?
but i know enough to know he's not actually responsible for most of the imagery
that's the weird thing, I can't think of a major company who so soley revolves around one person
he is nintendo
because he's wacky
when i look at that
honestly all i see is garfield
hes a genius boy
hes a good boy
but no other company could do it, becuase they haven't put out games for as long as nintendo
which is genius
not to mention i legimitately think at least a quarter of the strength of their handhelds are their ability to recaptialize on previous generations
yeah but thats because no one else in the industry provided real competition
wasn't he the janitor?
making them loose the console wars for the next decade
and it took resources away from the n64
especially after it failed the first time
yeah it seems like anyone at the developers and the ceo were not in tandem at all
but praying to a god to get there is
but the idea of immortality isnt dumb
the idea of motion sensors isn't dumb
the idea of vr isnt dumb
see i think anyone can come up with a good high concept (the idea of a flying machine) but its the design ideas that actually matter
oppai
are these good ideas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN-ZktmjIfE
okay mac, this is the last thing and this will clear up where we stand
I woke up to do homework
jesus
*idea*
because halfway through making the virtuaboy they realized it was a dumb *idea* and dropped its funding to work on n64
it came out way faster than anyone could have expected
that was because the n64 was in development heaven
which miyamota had nothing to do with
the gba
but they still made a console in between
they began working on the ds the year the gameboy color was discontinued
the gba was the same deal
ugh mac...
its easy for him to say in interviews after it was released that he didn't want to release it
not nintendo
intended by Yokoi
which was literally the same thing, but they didn't market as vr
they had a famicom perliphery years before that also crashed an burned
that wasn't even nintendo's first 3d system
here is my case and point
also mac
the 64 was even designed originally to have virtualboy comptability
but it was meant to be the inbetween between the snes and the n64
its easy to say something is a thing on the side when it fails
and why the n64 sold less than a third as much as the ps1
so for like the first time ever they had real competition
sony came out with the playstation
while they were making the virtuaboy
but anyway mac, here's the thing about what fucked over nintendo
back then vr was like flight simulators
thats just 3d
but that's not vr
its just a prototype of the 3ds
it didnt even have full fov
to response to anything else
thats all
but its just depth of field
that's another important distinction
also virtuaboy isn't vr
"struggling" in a corporate sense
like it was a struggling company until the nds/wii release
i think you overlook how much the virtuaboy fucked over nintendo
but it was an experiment that almost bankrupted them
knowing the limitations of your tech is part of the idea process
the concept of the virtuaboy was not successful
you mean a development platform?
maybe
because true failure begins at the concept level
but that doesn't negate the fact that it was shitty
i just wanted to acknowledge that major corporation have made a lot worst mistakes the ouya
know that ill know ill do better with semanitics
im sorry üò¶
i didn't know we were arguing so i wasn't staying strictly to our terminology
what about ouya is a good idea?
yeah, we need to abolish kickstarter
just like no mans sky is a good idea of a game, if the developers had a compeltely different idea
but their idea wasn't what they intended it to be
and excuted even more poorly
i still think its a bad idea
because we are talking about bad systems
the n-gage
do you know what system was a bad idea?
and virtuaboy sucks more
and virtuaboy sucks
but ouya sucks
ouya is a good idea if done right
no one wants to play tetris vr
its totally a bad idea
to the point that the vr literally gave everyone an immediate migraine
yeah they were just 20 years behind in tech
they didn't do it just to be fun
but nintendo like ouya thought that was going to be the next stage of consoles
eh, okay but the virtuaboy just literally didnt work
k
...
they just didnt have enough capital to fail
or the virtuaboy
i mean it was no worse of an idea than the playstation move
is pretty dumb
I mean the entire idea of just porting all of minigames.com to a console
"Our controller has a touchpad, you're not going to find that somewhere else!!"
I cried https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO_dO3mMboQ
god, nationals is so fucking boring https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5YbK5Z4dtE
i need to learn this https://www.twitch.tv/furiousbr/v/80938561

Maaaaaac
Mac join call.
You can still work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKyzFW7bJrM
also I found this video the other day I thought you would appreciate
I was listening to an interview of him
hes so soft spoken
here he is being a cutie https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7gbc1geJ_Y
also kk slider is based off of totaka
weird
this one is apparently hard to get
yup
my favorite version https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPXFQ0M82do
or find without looking into the code
but they are usually very hard to trigger
yup
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urhJZZs1Qd0&index=13&list=PL_mA0IDio6OU1qghj_1IUg1cxW1FGcpXd
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0KnkU1cZz4&list=PL_mA0IDio6OU1qghj_1IUg1cxW1FGcpXd
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n41Pj54Cgek
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruFzO2X-h8w
you know about the totaka song right?
so this game is basically the soul predecessor to KK Slider which is why you like it so much
and the dude who made animal crossing also helped make some of the music
along with like every nes game koji didn't do
and directed the earthbound soundtrack
that was made by the same guy who did the tetris soudtrack
yeah dude
it has some great people on it
that game has a really interesting development history
let me know when you are ready, I'm just doing homework
k
and then ill be busy all weekend
because i have so much to do this week
same
yeah just a bit
hmm
yeah he's not obscure, I just haven't really read anything of him
lol
this will be neat too because doctor strange is one of my largest marvel blindspots
coo
thats two weeks
it opens nov.
4
yes
do you want to go see that with me opening weekend?
mac I forgot doctor strange was a movie
yup
yuo
He never stops talking about wilco
My dad has seen wilco many times.

Song
I could tell what dog that was as soon as it turned on
I like it
Hmm.
I've been listening to folk all morning so let's go rock
It can be whatever, but yeah it's gotta be work appropriate
I need an album yo
I know I sort of love that.
Of there being enough things at Kmart for me to actually have to work the whole time.
Yeah.
I remember those days.
Le Pok√©mon
Playing French Pokemon at work
Probably as much as whoever is streaming little big planet kart racing right now.
I know what I'm streaming tonight.

If only.
That's what I'm here for asher
Mac we gotta make a change on the website.
If we can get three then I'm down

Everyone knew this mac
Lol
That was so shitty
Also they used silent hill 2 sounds
I got that reference.
10/10 i'd suck miyamoto's dick
yeh
üò¶
yup
because it is all lever and pulley based
SKYRIM CONFIRMED
this is crazy!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5uik5fgIaI
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS YET???!!!
OH SHIT MAC
i always loved her as a kid, beucase she conjured and then enslaved the devil
almost like people have different opinions
a lot of music that is great wasn't designed to be great for all consious reasons
just like how the vocal lines sort of distort together making it way creepier
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWB8J6YxVXQ
have you ever heard the secret message in ashley's song?
i don't know its sort of like how listening to certain songs at lowerquality enhances their quality
what?
on the shitty ds speakers is amazing
especially the original version
oh by far
because there is nothing like it
when i was a kid i always thought the music in warioware was like an obscure genre of japanese msuic
their top 5 pop artists
in the video
the top 5 are fucking amazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne84d5O0uKg
from warioware
my favorite popstar is vanessa
No Asher.
You mustn't sin
nvm, I was wondering why i couldnt access a bunch of websites, but apparently everyone is having this problem
yo i need help, can you all read this?
Can't I'll be gone
That's the culmination of my best times, not the actual speed run itself.
Total time was like 25 minutes.
8:45

I think I'm going to buy the next Mario game
I saw that
X
The one we played was from c
No not that one.
Was what it?
i got this
okay got a 95/100 on my study guide
k lets do this thing
you should still play it though
it runs on my mac
the game is pretty funny, you should download it and check it out
i thought so
its just like a marketing stunt
also i just downloaded the anamanaguchi game
alright asher, probably in about 30 minutes ill start streaming
this one is better https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=103&v=b6SL57fi1QY
https://twitter.com/MaxScoville/status/789138411231678465/video/1
oh my god
Join our study session
Mac
Ronald play with me
so obviously no concrete descisions until we get more info, but it's looking good so far
but like coming from the standpoint of both a nintendo fan, but also someone who is very conscious of when they are buying something, the ns shows way more potential than the wii u did
yeah that was mine
ronald you should play with me in a bit
last november
yeah
because i no matter what have to play the mario games
and 2) when it comes to nintendo it is not a questions as to if ill get a product, but when
well 1) you would carry it around like a tablet not a gameboy
because i legit don't really like sam right now
nope
it wasn't even directed towards me, but i feel so attacked


its killing me
mac also, im steaming because sam made a facebook post bashing the ns
its too late
is when he is the only out of ordinary element in a sotry
because thats where wolverine thrives
i know which is what is exciting about it
because the blads come out of her feet
but shes way cooler
shes a clone of wolverine
yup
now im super excited
i just rewatched the logan trailer and realized that is x-23
you fucked it up
...
dont fuck it up
nice
like i said, its considered to have one of the best multiplayers in the modern generation
it has a really vibrant online community
yeah dude
i could see a game like fallout emulating that
the entirity of ps4 online is based off of darksouls coop system
and darksouls is considered to have some of the best mutliplayer in games right now
thats what they do in darksouls
i want to play fallout so bad
üò¶
hence eso
but i think one of the biggest factors that makes bethesda games so much fun is the fact that there is no multiplayer, and i think when you try to incorpporate those elements you loose a lot of what makes those games great
if you stripped all interactables from it though, and divided up the overworld, it could definitly be possible though
a game like borderlands, even though it doesn't alwyas seem like it, is way more simplified than fallout
the memory would be able to communicate the physics in time either
because all it would take is someone hopping ontop of a table and knocking everything off for disconnectiont to happen
games like fallout could never be multiplayer without a central server
i dont think so ronald
eso
zenimax, has literally only made one game
because the stuidio that manages it
which is just asking for trouble
but thats also because its a bethesda online game
from what i've heard
not great
what about eso ronald?
i can also go off of how console servers work
i just know that when i play an online fighting game online versus on a console it is very different
on a console you don't have a problem with that
yeah but thats the thing
trine
civ V
portal 2 honestly isnt great
borderlands 2
batman arkham origins
also im going through my library to see games that have shitty multiplayer servers
and then i cant imagine production cost being above 20-30
so you don't have to worry about marketing
and they sell themselves because they are the cheapest
their manufacturing cost is like 6
they'd lose way more money than they would gain
lol
make a gameboy
like think about something like minecraft
and to not have to worry about developers fucking up
my point is that with xbox and sony you are paying for a consistency
lol
its not great
and thats running a 15 year old game
age of empires is problematic
yeah and the civ servers suck
the call of duty servers are the worst
which is a shit ton
any non-valve mutliplayer game mac
i mean wow as in wow not wow as in W.O.W
wow
steam has nothing to do with it
with pc you are relying on the developer
thats what im saying mac
because they know that developers don't do shit with their console servers
thats what you are paying for
mircosoft and sony host them
because you are only coming at it from dota
not steam itself
most of its strengths come from the fact that the games servers are the ones doing the grunt work
that steam is better
i disagre
and you get free monthly games
but their service is better than any current free service
coming from years of xbox live and a year of playstation online
yeah but the service is noticeably better than other free ones
i literally just screamed
....
correct
yes it does mac
most developers spend their time working in the pc servers
because then you were just relying on the game's servers which are really not that well made on console games
it made online gaming almost impossible
no there was a free version on the ps3, but it was legitimately terrible
i got charged 60 last week
i would know
nope
playstation online and xbox live are the exact smae price
you know playstation online isn't free right ronald?
no they shouldnt
you are coming at this from a bias of being a smart person
thats not true at all
steam will always be more competetive
no it wouldn't
and now that is gone, they are having to reach out
because sony's partnership with from was what set them apart in the early years of the ps4
from working in a video game story i disagree
i don't know mac
sony is very good about that
the best ps4 exclusive games are on the ps4 and only the ps4
false
thats not true at all mac
getting third party devleopers for the wiiu was a financial disaster
they really tried with the wiiu, but it was just a finacial disaster
which is something theyve known for years, but have never gotten a handle on
they would finally be back on top
but imagine if they could have the best of both worlds
exclusive titles is their bread and butter
also mac you do realize this means that nintendo could develop new consoles that just update the dock first before coming out with a whole new pad
but hopefully that wont be the case for much longer
because no matter what, both will always have better capability than nintendo
where they have to innovate, but also make sure they don't get behind microsoft
who is going to have to find some middle ground
which means the biggest problem is for sony
because if they can always stay ahead in that, there will always be a market for them
microsoft will likely go in the tried and true direction of just trying to increase graphic and processing capability
what's going to happen is that black friday 2017 4k tvs will be cheap enough the be mass purchased, and that will effect the console games
2016 is a dead year
2017
so sony and microsoft have to compete with a brand new console that can actually play the games theyve championed for the last decade, and all they have are just graphical improvements on their previous consoles
so sony is going to have the playstation 4k, xbox is going to have the one-s and nintendo is going to have the ns
christmas 2017 is a new console buying season
yeah but ronald heere the thing
which were already dying
yeah especially sony because they just single handily killed the vita and the playstation tv
and will likely have a closer competetive library with ps4 and xone
but this console is different
and the graphic limitation
because they have to deal with all the gimmicks
because ronald, third party developers usually dont like developing on nintendo consoles
which is big for nintendo
and bethesda, from software and a lot of other big names are on it
but nintendo announced all the third party developers theyve partnered with
its just a normal console ronald, which means that any games made for it are specically made for it
next tuesday
to have one half be bow and other half have skyrim
which would be smart
which means it will likely be a launch title
they likely already made the ns version at the same time as all the others
i love you so much
i love you ronald
and the controllers are rad
and will likely retail for a lot less than a standard tablet with that kind of capability
yup
i just care about being able to play it without crashes or game-hindering lag
if i actually cared about graphics I would make a better pc
yeah but you know how i am with graphics
because in that case, I see no point in having a ps4
considering bethasda is a confirmed partner for this, do you think they will rerelease any other bethesda games for it?
times 64
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5uik5fgIaI
and while playing skyrim on your computer
and while having sex
and while driving
let us tell you
no ronald
it got some sweet third party develper deals
other platforms i mean
its not running them from other tablets
so a....
tablet
not only does it run skyrim, it runs skyrim h-fucking-d
gameman
yeah
except its bigger, and like a tablet
new gameboy
overwatch confirmed
because you goofed and forgot to charge it
whats really going to suck though is when joycon (l) runs out but (r) is at full juice
NINTENDO HAS CREATED THE FIRST HYBRID CONSOLE
without wireless, they dont even really need that much power
because the main energy drain for controllers like that is the wireless
i bet you they will
becuase i doubt the joycon's use very much energy when they are plugged in to the pad, so they can feed it energy
its genius
yup
thats really smart though
and now we have it
i remember this being the one thing i wanted most from nintendo when there were rumors of a new console around 2009
drive
so i can play mario kary while I trive
but anyway I'm getting one of these for my car
sort of like the classic controller
they are just two large, which makes me feel they wont be tight enough
the joycon looks great
just on the pro controller
yeah but those buttons do not look good at all
oh okay
also what could possibly not be finalized?
what hardware changes could they make in five months?
but you can see that it is
so it must have a battery itself that can charge the controllers while you are playing
also i just realized that the center thing on the joycons is a charger
they look cheap as fuck
it just depends on those buttons
the pro controller looks so comfortable
just two ouyas super glued to a playstation tv
lol
also has anyone pointed out how much the design of the ns looks like the ouya yet?

no in the future everyone will have vr with these bad boys

man we never should have deviated from the best controller design
becuase it took like 10 years before people started to catch on to the fact that thats the best way to do a controller
you mean the wii mote
because i just need to hold off until the next mario platformer
and if it is 350 or less at launch ill predorder it
im so getting this whether or not it has streaming though
yeah because your phone can probably actually access the internet
which is good because that would be when it is the hardest
if you are using the streaming for multiplayer, odds are you aren't playing online
because here is the thing
thats what is going to set nintendo apart
whereas everything else relies on internet connections
so it is compeltly indpendant between the dock and the pad
yeah but thats because it wasn't designed to rely on hardware, nintendo is developing this form the baseline
i really don't think it would be that hard for nintendo
considering steam, apple, and sony have all been doing it for years now
lol k
especially considering you aren't crossing development either, the game would be developed for the same console
yeah which is why it sucks and no one uses it, but rather than having weak tech stream to strong tech nintendo seems to be having normal tech stream to normal tech which i feel would work better
check yourself
vita also streamed to ps4
if sony did it three years ago, i'm sure nintendo can
that would make the most sense, considering that technology is pretty easy to do
so you can do multiplayer
but the station can also stream it from the pad
the station boosts
i think it is all in the gamepad
yeah
you think?
I bet you it can
useful, but it also is completly playable without it
they aren't real games, they are just minigames to make you feel better about the fact that all the good games don't utilize the gamepad nearly as much as they should
on the eshop
so they couldn't be backwards compatable anyway
and also arent real software titles
yeah but those games suck
i didn't see nintendo land
which just use the pause menu for it
i know beucause they all have no game pad modes
nope
they use it, but it isn't mandatory
they dont
because i sincerly doubt they are doing a rerelease of splatoon
the only way it wouldnt be backwards compatable is if it doesn't have a touch screen
yeah but its not mandatory
what game is that mandatory for though?
i definitly don't think it will be backwards compatable with the wii u
I can't imagine that it isn't but i didn't see it in the video
also has the ns touchscreen been confirmed?
although i sold my wii, and will probably sell my wii u now
i mean, thats what i did
i just decided to go with the most recent model becuase i had the moeny
within the same year yeah, but thats because i needed a new ds, I had honeslty forgotten that the 3ds was out when i bought it
same with wii u
when the 3ds was annoucned i didn't give a fuck
jesus
but rather just being a ronin
i love it, because for me wolverine is best when he is not doing super hero stuff
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man_Logan
its like a western with wolverine, which i love
its kinda awesome
or rather their healing factor just keeps them alive, it can't heal their wounds anymore
all the mutants are wiped out, but those with healing factors survive, but they just loose their healing
he looses that ability
he doesnt regen in old man logan
its the opposite of an origin story
no
so thats now confirmed rather than just speculation
its like my personal favorite wolverine story, and what i consider to be the bst
no we knew it was coming, we just didn't know the plotline
but wolverine fans are more adamant
it still has a lot less views than ns and rdr2
i didnt think old man logan was ever going to get a movie
yeah it looks amazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Div0iP65aZo
no one watched its trailer
poor wolverine movie
agreed, but its going to need to have a nice case to justify carrying it around
which is sad considering both got more views in 30 minutes than this did in three years https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zIDiHXvhOY
thats the exact same as the nx
half a million in 30 minutes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmA6MrX81z4
hey they didn't do too bad
and nintendo is more conscious of the power consumption of their consoles than any other company
because the vita can go for 7 while streaming ps4 games and it has a much smaller battery than i would imagine the ns (because of its larger surface area) will have
but it will at minimum have 7 hours
its more of something you'd bring when you know you need to take up large chucks of time, not just casual play
or i guess i should say a handheld
but yeah this is not a portable console
i think it will be decent battery life, I'm just hoping it will be better than average
also asher considering the 3ds is going to be around for a while still and already has a great library and backwards compatibility, no matter how great the ns is i don't think that was a bad investment
for 49.99 - 59.99
they will likely only seel them in the full packs
mac thats bullshit and you know it
which is ridiculous when you think about paying 20 for a fucking nunchuck
thats 70 complete
and nunchucks at 20
wii motes have consistently retailed at 50
yeah they totally can be mac
a lot of things to break/loose
interchangable parts is the best thing for adult me, but the worst thing for child me
no it doesnt mac
they are just smaller ns's
also what if the new handhelds are just perlifieries to the ns, rather than stand alone consoles.
so you can cross play
and which system will gen 8 come out on?
what does this mean for the future of the handhelds?
but anyway here is the real question
7 is a good standard
its 7 without
its 5 when playing 3ds games with the 3d
also heres the real question.
we can only hope
maybe
vita can last about 7 hours, so i'm hoping nintendo can surpass that
I'm also curious about battery life

yeah and i didn't buy either of those at launch
but if it retails for more than 350, no way
i mean regardless i need it for the new mario platformer
we will see
their
there trailers always prominently have a majority of people in their 20s
thats typical with their trailers though mac
eh
That's all I fucking wanted
FINALLY
which means no scratches
like 0% gloss
also can we talk about the fucking sleek af matte design?
if it has wii u online i wont be getting it the same year
I'm just worried about online and price
considering it is still a tradtional console I think it is fine
lol
also im very interested in how the third party hardware companies are going to recreate those controllers without having them be too shitty
once more info comes out and it turns out to be good
mac will you get one with me
good call
yeah fuck it i'm just going to go to my last class of the day
also im going to keep calling it the nx because its quicker
im just excited because thay means i can play the next darksouls game on thte nx
this is just sampling though, but yeah
things like tt/ea/and sega are predicatable but bandai nambo, from software, and bethesda are huge

ill find it
nintendo also released a list of the thrid party develepers
yeah
it was after zelda
thats why i said skyrim confirmed
yes
dude
yeah
I've just been staring out the window for the last ten minutes trying to decide what to do
and im so euphoric from the sexy switch
its literally the only day this month it is supposed to rain during my classes
I desrve it
Yeah I think I'm going to skip class today
so the new controllers are call "Joy-Con"
i guarantee you no one in my literature class in half an hour will be tlaking about it
thats pretty great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEKCetCeibs
nintendo has gotten so much better at making trailers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4e3qaPg_keg
also the new game footage from the next mario platformer has got me pumped the most
i mean considering the ps vita can run skyrim hd
also i love nintendo commercials becuase they trick me into thinking buying their products will be a social experience, rather than just me playing mario maker in my underpants at home
with that resolution though, I'm curious as to what streaming and downloadable movie options are though
basically jus the size of the wii
also im looking at it again and the docking station isnt that small
because its nintendo, also skyrim hd edition isn't hard to run
I love the world
quarter of a million views in less than ten minutes
I wonder what it will retail for, and if nintendo has gotten their shit together with community play yet
this may be the first console i ever get on launch date
thats like tomorrow
MARCH OMG
well, its time to sell the ol' wii u
they literally just designed it based off of a theory forum
i told you mac
skyrim confirmed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5uik5fgIaI
and its up
i think thats because they aren't streaming it
i would do it from nintendo.com, but im afraid it will crash
exactly
lol, i just have the youtube page on autorefresh
for three minutes
no point of doing a direct over one thing
because they are just uploading a video
i'm considering making this the first day i skip
ive just spend the last hour reading about autocastration, so i really need this nintendo direct to happen
I am disappoint.
Like I can't send you a message, or even look at your profile
I like seeing you are online your 3ds but I can't do anything about it
üòàüíÅ
maybe tomorrow
like fishnets all the way down i mean
and im probably going to replace the leggings with fishnets
yeah im even borrowing heels
So I went with option b
Without having to spend actual money.
I couldn't think of where to get a unicycle in time.

This is the Halloween costume I'm getting
Lol
Then I'm just not even going to bother going at 11:50 that day.
I'm just going to take it from the store whenever we get it.
K
Thursday
So we could drive to the store at like 11:50 I could open it up and sell it to us.
I can just have my own midnight release for sun and moon.
Also Mac guess what I realized.
Another reason I don't shop at H&M is because my thighs don't fit into any of the pants.
But the rest I make sure are really nice.
See my technique mac is I buy 95% of my clothes from goodwill
I feel like those can't be pretty pricy.
Don't you mainly wear cargo pants though?
Pants are a fucking investment.
Pants are different though.
I've never spent more than 20 on a shirt
Yup
Yup
Except double the cost.
Like gap or oldnavy
Yeah
Yeah
And express is best for short gay people
Because of...umm the hiring practices....
Which is why I avoid it
Yeah.
I always get whatever socks they have on clearance when they restock the clearance.
Considering I buy like a pair of socks every two weeks from there.
Nah I know everyone that works at express.
I would go to H and M but.
A girl I have a crush on works there.
I pretty much only go to express because they are the only people that carry xs
I bought a bunch of really nice clothes today, it made me realize how much I love having clothes.
I'm honestly still not hyped but I look forward to seeing it
I don't remember me ever being hyped for hardware ever.
For sure.
And actually 10am for us is way better for Nintendo than 11pm for Japan from a marketing standpoint.
That's literally the only time that is best for both parties
I think it was best optimized for both ends.
It's almost like there is a calculated timeframe for when it would get the most traffic.
What if the nx IS rdr2
Sneaky Nintendo
But yeah no longer have the front page of ign for that day
I mean I feel like the people who are really hyped about rdr2 don't really give a shit about the latest Nintendo console.
Hhahah
This storm is legit
Lol
You should email them and explain why you'll be late
Lol
And Pokemon hd which will be bundled with real genetically engineered Pokemon.
"Oh no!
Im'a afraid'a I didn't catch'a that"
More like "youv'a gotta turn'a left'a"
I'd be so okay with that
Omg.
NX is an ai confirmed.
Virtua boy 2.0
I'm sure mac and I will be going wild in the chat
üò¶
We should all be in call for that
Fuck.
the crediblilty of pooppoopfart...
thats awesome
its coold becuase its all the same dude
But baroque originate in inside story.
So it counts.
Fawful
Fateful isn't exclusive to inside story though.
Bloque should be in the next smash.
I was also kidding.
Bowser

Too good
I just walked in on my grandfather praying, and i literally felt worse than if i was to walk in on him having sex
so what do you think mac, are you going to buy sun and moon?
http://neatpotatoes.tumblr.com/post/152006009750/fuggmuff-i-just
true
http://flange5.tumblr.com/post/152007576976/thefizzynator-i-am-exactly-0-sorry
That outfit is so dorky
Try battling while riding.
It's hilarious.
I know I've been snap chatting them all night mac.
It's pretty good.
Ash is now canonically in the pokemon game universe
I literally drew Asher and beat the sun and moon demo in that time.
Mac overwatch takes priority over fucking the ladies.
That's because you said you would be ready at 9
Omg mac
28-3 works greats.
It's asher

I'm ready I guess
By like a considerable amount.
For the first time ever I got matched where I was the best one on both teams.
K
I have dinner at 7 then I'll be free
Play with me
It's a bad word asher
<@!127535721857679362> <@!127535721857679362>
<@!127535721857679362>
The team skull theme is I think the first Pokemon song in game to have words

Also twirling confirmed
Ash is canon in the Pokemon games now!!!!
Omg omg oh my fuck
Shit I'm from kanto.
No one casual reads that
Why the fuck is traditional Chinese even a fucking option
Playing in that traditional Chinese.
Let's fucking do this shit

Like over 50% the size of x
This demo is pretty large
Ugh I can't believe I'm going to download the demo...
All I ever wanted
K I told Mac I want to play tonight.
I'm so playing as a girl mac
Cheerwine is the only red soda I can drink

We already had ours.
Yours is longer and later than ours
No

I'm going popplio for sure.
Elegant as fuck
Also humble bundle has essentially every transformer comic for $20.

<:sadboy:230133848740986891>
Mom, dad.
Stop fighting
See, this is why I have remained quiet.
This is amazing.
I'm going to pin whatever discussion comes out of this.
Join chat you yahoos
I think I could easily avoid the internet enough.
Im hoping to make it to march.
I also have a pact with Philip to see how long we can go after the election without knowing who won.
I got close with sam once because he was being a dummy, but I didn't.
I have still refrained from uttering single opinion.
lol
I've never heard you talk about anything that's not culture or tech based
Mac#3165 I can't tell if that's a joke or not
Lol Asher you made a political post
In like 30 minutes when I get home from work
I'm a fucking celebrity
Til I have 57 followers in Pinterest.
Sexy
What dat
lol.
I'll see wednesday
Anything is possible
I'd prefer waluigi
We sold our green one, but our other store may have it
I meant give me 10 so I can get the game and you can get the amiibo
Lol

You should give me 10 so I can buy this
He seems like he would have known captain beefheart personally

Humble bundle.
It's pretty casual

Ronald dark souls 3 went on sale
I'll take algorithms with you make.
What year would you guys use for retro?
mac
Macgregarious Heal Slut Vogelsandwich
Hmm
Actually nvm Philip is "Chester" just remembered that.
I don't know Asher's or philips either
I only know Ronald's because it's my favorite city.
I mean.
I've heard it before but I don't think I cared enough to remember.
Don't know
Like more than half.
Like 95%
Like, that doesn't even make sense
...
I did.
But I thought I'd be nice.
She wants the xp bonus so she can get the mercy skin
By the way i think I'm going to invite cosplay girl to play overwatch with us sometime.
Yeah I mean I've heard it's good
Is it on sale?
Yeah why?
Please
Also someone buy me aragami
At 6 minutes it it becomes Zelda for a bit
Each track of this album is a 100% a level in a platformer.
https://youtu.be/WDsyzMy4ZXc
<@!71716577669550080> I love music that is totally a video game ost that never got a video game.
What if gameworld goes out of business before the end of the year.
Mac
So my guess is mid to late twenties
I remember watching tapes of him where he is clearly not who he is today
I honestly didn't even know he was still alive
Classic Phil
ugh now i want it

üò¶
I was listening to that while reading about massacres in china and it was really fucking spooky
Guys.
Let's get spooky
But 7 is the exception
Like two from each game
Two from anything that's not 7
Not currency
My note says not to buy boxes
I'm buyin' em all

fucking useless


so mac's just got an update that added siri
<:asshole:234377672908603392>
how the fuck isn't yoshi a meme
this is all literally on the first page when you searh yoshi

üò¶ too tiny
<:inflation:235213902856585216>
duh

asher, i have a present for you
Planet üêú
I'm telling you
Dragonfly = only üíØ % bug
Wasps have such cool predatory dynamics though.
Glorious.
Look at that shit.
It's gorgeous

But they are beautiful!!!
I'd be so into that shit.
I wish they had a planet earth specifically for bugs.
I mean Mother Nature is truly the greatest entertainer.
Lol
Could you imagine doing that IMAX stoned out of your mind?
I just sent her a friend request.
So I can live stream their steamy computer science discussions
Lol
Is clara with Mac?
I played the first five levels already.
So good
I got it for free because Bedford goofed

Mac üíª fix your üé§
ronald
oh no
I think I'm going to go ahead and get it serviced, because if i do decide to sell it, I would be able to break even at least
yeah i can
if i have it serviced I would be getitng a brand new playstantion with my harddrive already in it
maybe the case for another 20
and then the rest is pretty much useless
i could sell the motherboard for like 20
yeah but i'd only be able to sell it for like 30 bucks
no
so it'd be like a best friend with a lobotomy
but all the data will be lost (i think)
the longer i wait the more it will lower in value
ive logged a lot of hours, but in all fairness i should be playing less videogames anyway
yeah üò¶
no we sell used ps4s for 240
so i could either get a 30% bonus on that and do it in the store, or sell it 150 by myself
our store gives out 125 for them currently in credit
game bundle and new systems are same price
yeah
(will be)
no they are
299.99
and then see if i can sell it for more than 125
what I may do is get it repaired
lol
this has been the only one ive ever had a problem with
It hurts me when I loose money
üò©
like a lot of my ps2 and gamecube games
honestly if i do end up selling all my ps4 stuff, I may end up selling more
but i don't think it could handle it
i havent tried any current gen games
probably wouldn't
don't know
"i dont care" because id be fine with not having a ps4 anymore
i spent 400 definitly got short changed
i don't care at all as far as playing.
I care as far as money
because i get the "blue light of death"
its not the power
ive tested out multiple chords on multiple outlets
yeah, its fine
its power supply box is internal
ps4 doesnt have that
maybe, but ive never heard of sony doing that
its got to be the same model
no
ni
complete with everything
I've dealt with this before with sony.
If you send your system in for servicing they just send you a new system
but i will also get a new system and an extra controller
i agree
yeah
yup
which ended in septemeber
i had a year warranty
they said they will "service" it which means they just make sure there was not external damage and then send me a new one
it doesn't turn on anymore, and I called sony support
what do you think I should do with my ps4
m'kay
I have the wii version if you want to borrow it
"such as"
i mean "not being as good as the other games" is still good when you are a zelda game
we should play around 9
wasn't terribly invested
because I forgot to keep playing it after then
why what?
like 4 hours
So im debating on whether or not i should spend the 125 to fix it
so my ps4 is officially broken
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MbF0bc7iEs
Yeah
Asher.
No spoilers
The fuck is pandaTV
The joke is in the mirth
Classic xkcd
Yeah because this is the first new content in a while
It alright honestly
No
Yeah
Expansion
Mmorpg
lol.
I just always used my keys
So sad
You should watch the trailer though.
I dont even know the lore, but i cried
the trailer i mean
also what do you think of knights of the eternal throne?
Asher I need to start listening to more aphex twin
Who's the villain by the way?
Mac was his big red light blinking and luke hit it three times?
ronald join call
hurry mac get one
https://www.amazon.com/Greninja-amiibo-Super-Smash-Wii-U/dp/B00VM27UVW
Almost got it
I saw a greninja at toys r us
did i tell you that i preordered the waluigi amiibo?
look at the list then and look up the ones that look interesting
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiibo
are you searching for the exact figure you want?
what do you mean
imma make some tea then ill be ready
aight, asher you ready
<:sadboy:230133848740986891>
...
lol

ronald
is it better for playing overwatch?
what about playing overwatch
nerds
he's phishing you
tax
macgreggor
Ugh
when yall wanna do?
Mac ronald

We playing tonight or what
Lol nice
fair
if you want to just borrow my n64 until you are satisfied with toy story I'm fine with that.
I haven't been playing it very much.
asher
lol fair
I mean...
you could just get a mod that triggers all achievements
even though bethasda offered to do all the work
its so shitty that sony denied mods for fallout 4
Yeah, the main reason i want to wait is because they added a bunch of settlement stuff and considering how much time i spend on settlements I should wait until they realease all the stuff
im just going to buy all the dlc at once
but ill do it regardless
Yeah I've heard mixed reviews with nukaworld
I think im going to wait for the goty before i do another playthough
yeah ive spent way to much time on settlements
so when he defends my settlement he is just a tool of anarchy
because npc get infinite ammo
yeah I always give him a fatman and a rocket launcher
remember that begger who is addicted to nukacola?
and villagers
yeah
ugh, now I want to play
I just ran past them while taking a copious ammount of drugs
its those damn automatrons
yeah after i got into the vault it was fine
yeah I have to save spam that part
so it was hard
I did that a little too early
nice
fallout
where are you at ronald?
I think Deru was inspired by this part of majora for this song
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDqm6xE3r6o

<:preciousboy:234377704261156865>
Have UNC gotten any flooding?
I was going to ask you about that
Coo
By the way <@!125452744440938497> if you want to just borrow my n64 until you are satisfied with toy story I'm fine with that.
I haven't been playing it very much.
We should play ow tonight

whoops
http://maybemanmoth.tumblr.com/post/151267811613/missveryvery-hiroshi-ueda-the-red-devil-of
thats what we are doing tonight
Yup
lol
...
only kingpin
kingpin
that is a front for an evil japanese cult
who are defending a japanese company
but all im saying its dumb that daredevil is fighting ninjas
iron fist is a legacy though, which doesn't make any sense that hes white
its the same reason why iron fist is problematic
no stick is not
i just think if you swapped it around like that, you realize how crazy it is
which would make sense
hes not even a boxer
ninjas
out of all these ninja
ik hes like the best ninja
ninjas
because daredevil is about a white guy who fights ninja with ninjetsu
http://maybemanmoth.tumblr.com/post/151267811613/missveryvery-hiroshi-ueda-the-red-devil-of
that made me realize how fucked up daredevil is
i saw this amazing thing recently
rather than their abilities
of the heroes to have the same generic power set so you can can focus on their character
thats the point though
whatever
sure
probably both
its not my fault the show is sexist
I mean i'm just going off the comics here
they pretty much have the same power set, except she can fly
also she is about as invulnerable as luke
they just dont do it in the show
also jessica can actually fly
its just how they decided to tell the story mac
yeah but in the comics jessica jones strength is defined as unlimited
okay so luke cage can life 50 tons
realism
there is like a marvel break down of strength from when i was a kid
hes more like captain america
he cant
its like the difference between superman and like captain america
hes super strong but not as strong as jessica
yeah
he doesnt
he doesn't have the same strength
what question
yes
thanks!
what is my hulu password
MAC
jesse eisenberg was a very conscious casting choice because rather than being like what it Rockafeller was a super villian this is what if Zuckerberg was a supervilian
but make a billion while doing it
but with the techboom, its the young brilliant people who crash and burn
like back in the day old white men were the ones making all the money
I think it was to be some sort of thing on new industrial wealth
the batman v superman lex is a very weird take
yup
yup
if that guy had an infinite amount of money
its literally the main guy in that
have you watched house of cards?
lex luthor giving a comedy performance for charity and clark kent sitting in the audience wating for something to happen but it never does is a great premise for a one off comic
he apparently hates that role
lol
where I've spent all my life demanding attention, that if I got it 1000 fold I would just seize functioning
I always feel like he's what would happen if I became famous
i can't imagine that will be good
yikes
hes apparently performing at the comedy attic this saturday
probably something made up
yeah i dont think that's true
he blends in well in bloomington
lol yeahg
It's funny because peopple used to make a big deal about every time he'd come to town, but then realized that he is a very introverted and anxious person
so he's here a decent amount
his girlfriend's parents live here
mars attacks and beetlejuice are close seconds though
that and batman returns are my favorite burton movies
after one punch
we should watch nightmare before christmas tomorrow
lol
spooky and funny are like the only two things i enjoy
the thing I'm going to draw tonight is also from the same dream
which it did
thats why i was hoping music would trigger my imagination more
yeah no those are pretty standard nightmares
or there is a latin test and im not prepared
like the ones that make me actaully wake up in a cold sweat are the ones where I've missed like a weeks worth of class work
or like accidentaly breaking my 3ds
eh depends, that nightmare was pretty awesome.
Most of my nightmares involve me being late to class
eerie
thats spooky
thats not horror
except the little puppet things were darker and were like vibrating
that was my nightmare that night
mac did you see the spooky boy that asher made me have
we will give you the joke when you least expect it
its a dirty sex thing
eh
it wasn't that bad
Yeh
Mac we are meeting with the man at 3:30
already did
<:boobies:232323564764659713>
night
not to the manual labor
to the meaning to go to bed
Same
weird
i dont think it is
mac is going to be ruined
http://www.polygon.com/2016/9/29/13107970/stardew-valley-divorce-1-1-version
oh my god...
not in a bad way
she's also one of those ladies that just gets really emotional about everything
lol
I think she even has a girlfriend
she's doing a lot better now
yeah no that was right as they were getting divorced
shes had a rough time...
when was that?
i think she is doing well now yeah
I would loose my shit if she was my mom
in like a fun foreign aunt kinda way
mainly because his mom is fucking fantastic
yeah im definitly closer to gregs mom than i am to him
and she lives in my house for like months at a time
because i don't even talk to carolina
like exactly
its exactly like paulita and macs mom
actually ronald
because carolina and his mom are like super tight
yeah no ill actually follow up with that, because he always asks me if I want to get coffee and I always have class
so you guys will have a blast
and he loves pretending that he's socrates
who is like if my grand dad and LBJ fused
my grand dad dad
I really would be a blast for him
I will totally do that acutally
that would literally make his fucking year
YOU NEED TO GO HAVE COFFEE WITH WENDELL SOMETIME
fuck yeah
yeah
because hes been forced to focus on his "social media presence"
hed really like that too
https://www.facebook.com/michael.d.may.16?fref=ts
yeah
that sounds very blakey
is that from blake?
oh the august west thing?
its a grateful dead referecne
who
I saw that...
https://www.facebook.com/samson.may?fref=ts
my spirit dad isnt much better
to be fair though
its this guy's grandma
no
love it
and his mom's comments on it
It is an outright myth or lie‚Ä¶.that Adolf Hitler exterminated jews‚Ä¶.His answer to the "Jewish question' was the "Transfer Agreement" which is why the jews are in Palestine today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The Jewish question‚Ä¶.Is what do we germans do about the perpetual debt that the international jewish bankers have Germany in‚Ä¶.the jews had taken over all the lucrative position s in Germany‚Ä¶.Germans wanted Germany for Germans‚Ä¶‚Ä¶they were nationalists and actually they helped the jews relocate .even paid for it themselves‚Ä¶..the people that ended up in the camps and or prisons were mostly communists agitators and subversives‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and enemies‚Ä¶‚Ä¶they died from starvation after the ALLIES cut off the food and medicine‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.remember German troops starved on the front lines as well‚Ä¶..
Is israhell the most serious threat and enemy of America‚Ä¶..They've definitely bled us dry‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.They've stole most of our nuclear secrets and developed nuclear weapons against international law‚Ä¶‚Ä¶They've got a monoplu over the monetary system that allows them to buy whomever and whatever they desire ‚Ä¶..Their own talmud is clear and concise‚Ä¶ALl non jews are less then insects and are to be killed‚Ä¶..and ll the Whole Eath and everything in it is theirs by birth Right..Not just Palestine...
this is my fucking father
I just...
I can't
Patriots do NOT buy gold and silver‚Ä¶It is a trap‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The enemy wants you to liquidate your assets and have you buy as much gold and silver as possible , ,,So they can incentivize their thugs to commit the atrocities that they've planned‚Ä¶.." they'll be picking gold coins from fallen patriots ..like they did in the last civil war ‚Ä¶.
and it terrifies me
I've realized this since I was 14
like this is me if I ever make too big of a mistake asher
but just haven't gone fucking crazy yet
Im such a combination of them both
https://www.facebook.com/His.Sovereign.Liberty?pnref=friends.search
found him
wow
lol
lol you want to give her the tiny squint eyes?
I wish i could find my biological father's facebook now
it looks like someone scaled her face up in the character creator
oh shit yeah
what photo?
lol
by all means
then yeah go ahead
oh
its one of the only things im genetically proud of
yeah i know she is very attractive
my spirit dad
i mean my dad dad
i dont know what that weirdo is up to these days
my biological dad
but also yeah
wow
i denied my dad's request a month ago, but i actually still talk to my dad
she just found me
https://www.facebook.com/deeanna.may?fref=ts
my mom scares the living fuck out of me
my mom just sent me friend request
Fuck
mac's mom has sexy flight attendant milf friends
fuck
sigh *unzip*
https://www.facebook.com/jane.gouker.1?fref=pb&hc_location=friends_tab&pnref=friends.all
that have kids they see more often than they see me
i mean to be fair my parents have a lot of frineds I dont associate with
yeah
GOUKER
SHES FRIENDS WITH GOUCKER
FUCK
shes friends iwth sarah youngs mom
ugh
and is barely close to us
and mac is mac
yeah but thats becuase macs mom and paulitas mom are really close

how so
amazing
fuck
holy fuck
I literally just lost it
he will never know
nah ill delete all this anyway
i guess to be fair they are
but just tell him they are my friends
fair
because they don't know that's his sense of humor
i feel like his confidence is definitly a big if
yeah
not at the same time of course
actually I have like two chicks that owe me
üëÜüèø yup
yeah no I can like actually see that
and thats not fun
yeah, but then I'm scared he will hate me forever
yeah
THE
SHE NEEDS TO BIG DING DONG
YES
YES
YES
ronald if you get him laid ill get you laid
except
accept make me feel bad
I mean I always really want to do stuff like that to get him out of his comfort zone, but then I realize that putting him out of his comfort zone doesnt really do anything
or is as addicting
yeah because sexual degeneracy doesn't give you cancer
Ugh, why can't i be more like mac
he's my rock
I love him so much
obviously
until after
MAC WONT KNOW
and then never talk to us again
mac will probably throw up
ill make some then
k
lol I remember that
honestly....
double stuffed oreo suprise
we are sneaking it into a capri sun
but yeah
I agree ronald
lol to be fair im suprised he agreed in the first place
and I don't trust anyone except you and asher to do it
someone has to make sure I don't die
?
woudl you rather join>
while ronald watches
dropping acid with philip and mac
that'll be our new year's adventure
Also hi ronald
like you guys definitly share aspects and things in common, but not nearly as much as I share with each of you individually i feel.
yeah I mean I don't see how you could, like I feel very much like the middle ground between you too
lol
which still baffles me how a neurotic personality like mine has been best friends with him for so long now
lol yeah I also appreciate that hes a very hard person to get along with
even if that makes him come across as autsitic at times
because for all his faults he is as genuine as they come
he's honestly a better boy than i
what a boy
and really only philip becuase rather than sharing my insecurities he is just so aware of them
that's pretty much how i feel with both you and philip
that's definitly fair
when then gets into more self loathing
which then gets into self parody
which then gets into the problem of the aggressive white male
for the both of us
yeah it can come across as contentious i think
yeah i feel like we have a level of social consciousness but also a level of understanding of our privledge that makes us uncomfortable
what do you identify with?
they are just too darn perfect
yup, because as much as we love mac and ronald
there's so much fear of self parody that i refuse myself things i enjoy
yeah it sort of works both ways from what ive seen
I'm hoping that will come with age when I'm a little less self conscious
yeah especially when it is rooted in deep psychological trauma
thats good, if we havent grown since highschool than we are in deep trouble
I agree
"casually dickish"
I can never pull off hateful, even know I'm probably the most spiteful person I know.
If I wanted to go creepy it would have to be like eccentric creepy
I have been scorned by them before
I can make your eyes very hurtful yes
lol
but i just dont have it in me
I want to be spooky so bad
nice
yeah thats a hard one, because at what point are you invested enough that you should really care
right
my dads work is right next to centerstone and its a really interesting dynamic there
yeah for sure
ive spent a solid decade trying to forget poverty as a dynmic, except when i have breakfast with my grandma every week
ugh...yeah
my poor little sweet southern grandma
not my rich grandma either
ugh
who i literally want to punch everytime I see him because he steals from my grandma
because i've told you about the dude that panhandles around town that is my uncle
which is why i usually just keep my head down
growing up with people like that for half of my life, and then being super detached from people like that for the other half has made it really hard not to be a total asshole about homelessness
you are a far better person than I asher
lol
But yeah, let me know when it starts up and I'll help out
like Jill
especially because most of these people aren't even from town
yeah, thats my point exactly
to check it out
once
I'll go oncec
idk I am sort of salty about the people our age around town protesting the homeless situation in town, though i by no means agree with the town's initaitives.
I like that your comment drew attention to the larger issue, or more rather how these people can actually help rather than just finding something to yell about
Thanks for commenting on that post by the way Asher
i like the kid with tamogatchis
yes
Sorry that was for Megan...
Or how crosshatching works
Thanks!
I still have no idea how lighting works

This is probably the only time I've ever drawn something that has turned out 85% or more what I had in my head
Here's the ink outline

Asher the thing I'm drawing right now is because of the music you gave me
Those margins
15,000
15

This just came in sealed
Lol
I'm adding it
No
Lol
Yeah because it will only go up the longer you wait
Ronald have you bought your ticket yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYMD-hyEECk
pharah is totally based off of ranger x
TIL
I should delete them
maybe its because i have so many video game songs in my head
I study all the time but i just cant retain it
I'm so bad at learning vocab...
üëåüèø
and the first ac so those may be worth checking out
he did ac: brotherhood and revelations
Jesper Kyd
but you should check who composed the second one
thats the last assassins creed game I played
I dont know
to actually make it spooktastic
i need to rehaul the gameworld playlist today
that reminds me
although if you read this asher i really really liked Kode9 - 9 Samurai
i didnt have nightmares:(
speaking of which
uhhuh
üòÉ
you didnt
yeah but alas
i feel like you are weaseling your way out of not getting a video game reference
uugh
then why you say bastion?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YCN-a0NsNk
you didn't get the joke
Mac
Anyway.
G'night.
Hopefully it doesn't kill me.
Because I never listen to music
Because I always forget things besides art and stories can be spooky
I actually totally forgot that I have you as a resource
Thanks
I'll let you know if this worked tomorrow
Fuck yes.
And it needs to give me nightmares.
I need something to fall asleep to
Fuck yes!
That...don't have skeletons.
Like are there any spooky tunes you can recommend.
I'm running out of sources.
Asher where do you go to find spooky things?
It's amazing.
I saw it
he sounds like ned sneebly from school of rock
oh his voice is plenty sexy for me
i didnt even look at it
its 30 minutes long
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CssitSXXtYc
this popped up on my feed
it is so well done
asher did you watch that thing i posted
speaking of which
i legit cry a lot when cartoons are involved
yes...
i legit cried rewatching that
can we watch mulan
fuck one punch man
guys
so now i can actually do it without being a dumbass
I finally memorized that short cut
oh that reminds me mac
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSS5dEeMX64
fair
its like i dont even know you
...
lol
180 noscope with that peashooter
you are the best mercy player because you 100% accuracy battle mercy
i wasn't talking about you
I bet she can only play that old genji
doesn't realize you can hack the system by playing characters that don't need to aim
Only plays a scrub character like genji
I bet shes a fake
I bet she doesn't even really play
with a FEMALE
I got to talk about overwatch todau
ANYWAY MAC YOU ARE MISSING THE MORAL OF MY STORY
no clue
so they just added another one
yeah overwatch thought it was a problem that there were as many women of color as there were robots
although i wish roadhog and mccree were ladies
for the 6 white males in the game it all makes sense why they are white
lol
or are not supposed to be a white male
unless they are racist
because its hard to have a problematic white male
because harambe was too soon
and winston is problematic
because of the god skin and the tech support
symmetra is also extremly problematic
lol
hes been brazillian since launch
nope
brazillian...
but hes not
because he seems like he should be
i wish lucio was problematic
and how zenyatta is like a religious bastardization of eastern culture
yeah we talked about how mei is for some reason white
of course i did
Omg mac
which literally makes no sense
but has a native american costume
its because she's egyptian
not like problematic in the sense of the game
problematic means controversial
lol...
everyone
even though there are a lot of other problematic characters too
I actually was talking about how the most problematic character is zenyatta
also i love how mentioning justing raining summons ronald
because there is literally one per character
(   ) other
(   ) below
(   ) above
"where does justice rain from?"
so i slipped her a note
Some girl was talking about how pharah was problematic in my class today
also mac
but watching scary movies triggers it
I think it is funny that reading scary stories helps calm my anxiety
same thing with most ps4 games these days
the reason i didn't want to buy it was because we played it all the time at work
yeah
because none of us wanted to pay the 5 dollars
eric, katie, and i time shared it
I can borrow it from my boss
okay
lol
bowser's inside story?
Minecraft?
"
"I get that reference
thanks
So turns out you dont get the cool black theme on macs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtnxltSyfBQ
for like a minute
and I legit thought it was throat cancer
one of my lymphnodes was swollen this morning
thanks
oh

and the real hipsters will use gimp
they will use photoshop
instead of hipsters using typwriters
thats the next level
lol
that way i am truly crafting them
I write all my papers in photoshop
Yea, word is so beta

<:boobies:232323564764659713>

thanks for clearing that up
oh okay cool

maybe i should upload it facebook to see if i can link from there
hmm this is really weird...

I met his girlfriend for the first time btw

gotcha

no
a wii u has not dropped to 100 yet

not with enough margins to actually profit from
excluding roger
all roommates do their dishes
not true
the guy we all know
"my roommate"
they only drive
because they don't know what it's like
the most annoying thing i face on a day to day basis is people driving on the sidewalks
like...do you even know about the üå∞ üèö
‚úãüèø preach mac, preach üñêüèø
ronald dont try to change the subject
you fool...
because you dont read the context
üëÜüèø What he said
Like how asher and I are dick brothers?
YOU WOULD KNOW THAT IF YOU EVER READ THE CHAT
I posted this almost a week ago ronald
YEES
when ronald comes over
we should rewatch that
ive heard that before with other movies
yup
with willem dafoe and the woman from nympho
if its the one im thinking of
yeah
is that the one with dafoe?
I watch horror movies a lot which is suprising considering i hate them
but not today
i will
lol
"this cycle"

ronald do you know where i really wnat to go?
K
Screwdriver?
That feel when you are looking at nudes for a good model but none of the gals is thick enough.
Truuuuuue
Weed is the biggest fucking time suck.
Only weed
Mac it's just like video games.
But instead of a waste of time and money it's just a waste of your health and money.
This drummer chick is a huge stoner, so we will see how that goes.
Yeah cigars are great because you just get mouth ulcers rather than lung cancer
Yeah.
It was worth it
so i was legit terrified i was going to become addicted
also i was hanging with this chick a lot for like two weeks and she smoked like half a pack a day
you for real?
Asher
because he will be the only sober one
thats why mac will be the best programmer
*correct
about ruining their bodies
the big boys are talking
MAC I SAID CLOSE YOUR EYES
not enough to enjoy it though
like just enough to get cancer
yeah
fun facy
I'm smoking ciggies outside right now actually
lol

If these results could be dupli- cated in other settings, it would be helpful in defining how well free- dom from progression correlates with improved symptom control.
However, if the primary goal in assessing PFS is to have it act as a surrogate for symptom palliation or QOL, an argument could be made that one should simply measure QOL directly using established patient-reported outcome instruments.
hi
hi
cool
Of course as soon as i leave call you respond
hi
okay

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmlZ1WhlYsM&index=2&list=PLYjaa9h0s4AZ2pqBIYjKWNylnGsmyapki

I get paid to do what you are doing right now
yeah mac but get this
lol
so the joke holds
it still looks like ronald
so

is that cosplay not really good?
thanks mac
I have most of these already on playlists designed for moods on my computer
I maybe will
I'm really sad ronald never saw his cosplay
your playlist my dude
else ill do this all night
i have to stop
K
Oh yeah, love that one
now im trying to think of x360 and ps3 songs i like...
yarn
because if you dont organize it then you have epic skyrim music right before you have the 1-1 or kirbys epic yard
My favorite thing about video game playlists in the tone
love it
yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z54MpfR3XE4
PLEASE
because its two different really good songs
and i love rayman music
my favorite rayman song
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rs-CHD5Y8o
lol
yup
yeah im basically just putting a lot of these on here as placeholders to remind me to look back at the whole sound track
dont but the whole harmony of heroes on btw
which is why everyone hates me
I mean thats sort of what i use the gameworld playlist for now
yeah but way worse
this was essentially the only song in a 50 hour long game
but so good
its so bad
lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUjxPj3al5U
but you wont like it
ugh I want to put blue dragon on so bad
not really
but this is really good
but not on a playlist
like i like covers
becuase i always prefer to listen to the originals on a playlist
You and I are very different
"fucking pictionary for the nes"
"yeah but do you know what game has an amazing sound track?"
to impress people
I always save this one
lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJwh3erQlyE
üòÉ
so predictable
your taste
ugh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHEifuLCSIY
I FORGOT HOW GOOD THE DUCKTALES MUSIC IS
GOD
when a part of my job is making these
I like how you are giving me guidelines
i told you that soundtrack is really good
yeah
Im not going to add nintendo music until i run out of other stuff
corridors of time
well first im gonna add the classics
k
i did not see your guidelines
now i have playlist
tlaked with her
okay i did the deed
not great
I'm just on the phone with a lady
nothing
uhhuh
its a hassle
don't have sex until you are married
Mac,
I'm not but its not going to be 70% Nintendo
Not if I have any say
I will diversify your video game music taste
I'll add good stuff
No
I'll add some non Nintendo stuff
K
Lol
Lol
I feel like you aren't as impressed by the Ronald cosplay

Someone was cosplaying as you today
Ronald
Ugh this class is literally cancer
Agtred
I know.
I'm not kidding
The rest of the building are just to make us look impressive.
Every class at IU is in Ballentine.
Second floor (technically 4th)
Mac!
Come to Ballentine and hang with me
Asher you should really get a position as a night baker.
I feel like that's perfect for you
saves me a trip to bulbapedia

Look what o got for free yesterday
the platforming level look amazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMt27Jk36K8
Mac I'm so excited for this game
like this was only the last twenty years and most of it I didn't have any money to buy the stuff I wanted
man to be honest this timeline makes me realize how much gaming i get to do in the future
its like 2 hours of campaign
also thay is very beatable in one sitting
skyrim isnt a real games
real games should be beatable in one sitting
its funny because even today i view memory cards as "optional"
lol
yup
thats about the time i discovered the craft
oh right pc games
what the hell was i doing between 2011-2015
2015 - Keenan even more reluctantly buys a wii u
2015 - Keenan reluctantly buys a ps4
2011 - Keenan also gets a 3ds because he can
2011 - Keenan buys an snes to play with Isabel, but ends up just using it as his primary console
2010 - parents get divorced so keenan buys himself an xbox 360 and ps3 to distract himself
2008 - keenan breaks his arm and has to play wii sports left handed
2008 - keenan finally beats luigis mansion (no memory) and gets a wii
2007 - keenan play luigis mansion for like 3 months without being able to save
2007 - buys himself a gamecube with christmas money, only has enough money to afford either luigis mansion or a memory card (not both)
2004 - keenan gets a first gen gba and finally plays frogger
2002- keenan also gets gold
2002 - keenan gets an n64 and the addiction begins
2001 - keenan gets frogger's adventure for gba but doesnt have a gba
1999 - Keenan gets a gameboy color and pokemon red
i didnt have a ps2 until college
lol, well thats true, but I also was always 2-3 gens behind until 2008
like just at my time in the store
in my time mac I have witness the ps2, and xbox become retro
itll be like the equivelant of the virtuaboy
lol your retro wii u
by the time we retire we will have compiled a list of over 1000 games
So I have to make the most of it
I already think I don't have time, but thats not true at all
VERY TRUE
we can be like game grumps, but way less impressive
Mac this is exactly the important things we should be doing in college
<:slut:230132043986501642>
youll be good, you support and ill carry
yeah buts its EZ
tops
wolly world only took me an hour to get half way through, and if it gets expontentially hard then thats like 3 hours
like 3d world, donkey kong, and all the kirby games
some of these we could literally knock out in an evening
üëçüèø
all of which i can rent
except 8, luigi u and 3d world
all of these games
I own like.....
yeah mac still needs to beat dota
but first we must play every game ever
no thats next, we will comprise a list of the best video game music of all time
that so doable
beat one game a week
we gotta get commited
No way mac
lol
lol
lets make a google doc of games we need to beat/play
lol
a grievances case
apparently there is a federal case opening up against pokemon go
lol
I thought it said shitty boo

ty
I need music
mac
true
yeah I always find it funny how he is primarily remembered as a philisopher when his mathematical contributions to society were way more important
I helped miriam write her paper on him
that was its only goal
i wish asher was here
lol
what is that?
so basically it was
to be fair mac, I just finished a book that was written in 1660 that is an account of this
I love that in the 1600 in europe medicine was just literally cutting yourself, whereas in China it was heroin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgRMteY-o0k
get that out of here
NO
Ronald I just learned that essentially any classic book is free on amazon


Someone talk with me while I do my water changes please
Hope
One can hipe
So cute.
We will have been friends for almost half our lives
Same
We will have been friends for a decade
In 2018 after we graduate
Ronald
Asher should I get all the mothers on gba?
Gotcha.
Nice.
The kindle app on my iPad is so nice for reading all sorts of platforms
Lol
Lol how so
Nice.
The Monroe county library has a really good ebook selection
Why wouldn't you just get it from a library?
Or normal people for that matter
Because now color blind people can't read it
Maybe not the one thing but it's a huge no no
It's like the one thing you aren't supposed to do
üòÉ
I know

Mac look it's your color scheme
Dies for your sins.
Becomes meme.
<:perfectangel:230127369728425984>

A PLACE TO ANSWER THE BIG QUESTIONS IN LIFE
Lol
<:keenan:230127774562516992>
:keenan;
I thought I could also be into red snapper, but it just wasn't me
I'm more of a trout kinda guy and she was into red snapper
And we were into different kinds of fish
Yes
That was before I knew how to hook up
No
But that's clearly not my place.
I feel bad I can't give her any sense of closure so that wouldn't happen.
Geez
No <:slut:230132043986501642> is your spirit animal
Of her face
I mean she is blonde
I can sort of see that.
Yup
It's female mac
Young Lina
Tell her I say hi
I won't be home until 9:30
I've been working all week on a paper so I need to mercy's inside story
Yes
Then
They you get over it.
It's scary the first time
I've broken so many boxes filled with glass shit
You lift with your hands
No dumbass
Or with back problems
Sounds like my job at Kmart
i just mean that some good books can be extremly dry in audio format, so if you are alone and were just planning on listening to that the whole time you are fucked
20 times
or if you zone out
audiobooks are nice, but if you are alone and it turns out to not be engaging it really sucks
lol
as long as it is stricly auditory
if each of those podcasts were over an hour
its not
he says before leaving
what if i flew to unc just to drive up there with ronald
lol
then you are like fuck im not even half way
lol, its fun until you finish the ost
sometime airlines or universities offer deals for students to go back home over major holidays
you should also see if there is any sort of student funding you can get
yeah that sounds like a good idea
good videogames
also id be down for using our "bring our boy home" fund for this
but if you get like a good podcast or a good enough audiobook you can knock it out in like 10 hours
i would know since the entire way back mac and asher were asleep
but its a grueling drive to make alone
which is obviosuly way better
so like 120 total
one way
yeah i mean like driving is going to be like 60 bucks
which is decent
so 140 for each ticket
if you arrive on the 28th and leave on the 2nd you can get tickets for 283
yeah definitly
if you buy your tickets now you can get them at like half price
K well obviously you can stay at my place.
And I would pick you up from the air port of you did fly
He did I just sort of didn't invite him because I knew he wouldn't fit in the car
And I don't think all four of us driving to unc makes sense
Because Philip felt left out last year.
Although you should probably come this year:-)
Yes
<:keenan:230127774562516992>
...
Only if you bring snacks
Seriously though Mac.
We should rent and beat this in a night
Lik dis if you cry evrytim
Comic book burning.

So it was probably closer to 2
They weren't 8.5x11

<:keenan:230127774562516992>
We only had four pages to write in
Clever girl
Ezly
EZ game made for children
EZ
Discuss the interplay between Fredrick Opper's work and how it uses aspects that are present in modern work both before and after it.
Discuss Williams Steig's use of symbolistic drawing as how it pertains to the hierarchy of fine art.
Two questions.
That's how I felt about my Mongol class
I'm his ta next semester.
That'd be awkward
My prof can't fail me
I'll let you know in like 20-50 minutes
Lol what if
Well, gotta go take this test.
Gee whiz I hope I pass.
Answer 1: panel
The only actual comic term that isn't common sense is the gutter
Comic = comic
A page is a page
A panel is a panel
No
So dense
Lol I just heard someone say "and a panel is just a page of a comic right?"
Good to know
Lol
EZ
And what wards do what
And how a flying courier is better
You just need to know what a courier is
No you don't need to know stats
Which I didn't know until Monday
Apparently I'm taking this as a 5O0 class
Peasants
And there is like a table of people quizzing each other on the differences between creeps and super creeps
This is like if you took a class on dota mac
Hilarious
Apparently people made like study guides and shit for this
And now this
While I'm just over here listening to Mario kart
It's test day in my comic class and it's funny seeing everyone studying.
Dog 2.0

like im hoping he just gives me the key to his office
K, I emailed ron but I'm hoping that we can ust do this without him
thanks bud
thats why i need you
k
anyway would saturday morning work for you?
because if it does I will email Ron
you poor thing
because i can never get work done alone on the weekends
bascially I just know that on saturday unless someone is physically there, I'm not going to get shit done
and yeah if we get everything situated that day, I can work on the graphics and then we can get it up that very day
even if we publish it, it will still need work
I have work at 5 so its not like it will be all day
and maybe we can play mario
as in you could work on the site and inspire me
like around 10-11 I could take us to the store and then maybe after we could hang and work on graphics
yeah
do you want to comeover saturday afternoon to work on website stuff?
I've got to put my wii u to use somehow
we should beat it coop sometime
did the first part with zzyzx until he started slowing me down
I beat it during one work shift
that is a really good game
pro
and fire them like a rpo
I'll collect the star bits for you
lol we should tag team it sometime
only 3d mario playformer I haven't beaten
I maybe only got an hour into it
I've actually never beaten galaxy 2
yeah that one is great
also galaxy 2 has all the retro planet themes, which are the best
its so much memory
I own it
yeah its a 3:30 sound track
also my playlist whenever im in cayman is just a mix between animal crossing and super mario sunshine music
it gets me pumped
I like the mario galaxy 2 one more
now i want t oplay it
i forgot that game had minigames too
OMG
what a good game
yeah
I've only missed the ones from the ds version so far
I'm just listening it to the background and seeing if there are any i cant guess
now get back to fucking work
HAHAHA classic jim
I'm sort of sick of the startheme
I was thinking maybe I could do the overworld theme or something
oh yeah, hey guys...
Hey jim could you whip us up a star theme
because they will do the smash ones too
thats how many nintendo games there are my dude
and new super mario ds
yeah its so elaborate thye reused it for mario 64

That's what I thought about him going to denmark
Lol
go to germany, you will like it
that's like my dream vacation
DO THAT
THATS WAY BETTER
yes
or find an objective
jump off a buildoing
you have to get hurt
AGH
YOU KNOW <:slut:230132043986501642> ISNT GERMAN
FUCK OFF MAC
lol
but like they wont know
If you speak to them in english you will have more control
so they will just treat you "special"
yeah
yup
I don't blame you
lol
And when you are see and nazi you are supposed to salute ronald, duh
that way everytime someone speaks to you in chinese you will just look like a dumbass when you respond
You should go to china though
and english
Industrialism and german cutlure
i dont know if you would like denmark very mcuh, but you would like cologne
youd like it
yeah no fuck that go to germany
i mean they aren't wrong
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Like whhere is the host city?
where would you go in china
youve already been to china
germany
lol
and then all other classes for your degree are 400
you have to take the 101 calss
like if you want to do international studies
thats pretty standard with niche departments
<:soulboy:230126576933535744>
<:onepunch:230136244112326656>
I think unc might be dumb
mac
lol
900 is the dean
800 is forbidden
700 is blood
and 600 is eternal
around, they obviously are very well standardized
in the liberal arts 100 is intro 200 is topical 300 is critical thinking 400 is intensive subject study and 500 is grad
preach
preach mac
why is your online light red
lol
i think they matter in all the liberal arts
500 classes at IU are just essentially graduate studies
same with english
like a 100 level history class is for children but a 400 class is going to be about 4-5 pages of writing per class
only within the same department
lol 90% of my cancer grade is participation
100 level classes are too easy
üòë
I'm dying of boredom
yup
just learning what they mean
not interpreting them
not calculating them
we've spent 4 weeks on confidence intervals
cancer is okay
the class
My cancer class is the worst thing ever

Okay so women i'm: 65% matches now and dudes im 85%
brave
wow so you already worked for them without negotiating pay?
Good for you!
but that was years ago since ive known anyone who has worked there
only because the owner is actually crazy
i heard its a shitty place, but still nice!

yup
Ain't he great?
How's one punch?
Sorry bud
Oui Monsieur zit feels magnifique



Monsieur turtle bits wants zis hands on moi magnifique block?
Non
Ever
Best character
Sad Monsieur

No mon ami, you mustn't take my block

Let me find him

I spent a solid 30 in class today drawing him
bowser punches are so much fun
...
Mac I want to work hard, but like
lol
I want to play bowser's inside story, but I also want to get a paper done üò¶
why not 201
...
its just weird
k ill have to screenshare with you or something, its no big deal
yours
drupal's rag race
ronald click the background image and then scroll down
broken
your site is broken 0/10
But it wouldn't let me
I tried to go on megan cooke's facebook ronald
sounds like student council
see you at 1 million cups
now i can stalk you
ronald you just gave me your calendar
if someones photo is bright red its gonna look shitty
lol even your thumbnail is pretty much all blue
super blue
blue and white
ronald none of the people in the think team background image are you...
like so when i stop scrolling it takes me back to the lowest part of the page, rather than the top
its not actually buggy, just feels weird
it is just buggy how it forces a refresh rather than just letting me snap back
If its not this site is garbage
chrome on my mac
no
but other than that it is the perfect site
sliding all the way down is pretty buggy
nm no there arent
there are people in high school as old as that game
i mean thats fair
wow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9TpRfDdyU0
So true
that's why he is so sad

I'm white washing him
I wish mac was here to witness the progress of his mario
Tbh i cant even tell the difference

I can never remember
Shit this is what colors mario is right?

its like the law
I'm pretty sure children aren't allowed on the internet ronald
yeah
maybe
"Red Guy"
What who is mario?
This isn't mario, this is a legally distict new "ip" character

Mario is easy to draw except for his FUCKING hat
but there is a whole other world of functioning adults where the most important thing to them is colorguard
That i can understand
There is a whole other world out there that i dont eve know about
She's staying in school i'd imagine but apparently they rehearse everyday
She just got in actually
No idea.
I didn't want to ask Meredith
At like stadiums.
Against other color guard teams
No just on its own
Til there is such a thing as professional color guard.
I wanted to get a picture of the pornasaurus but I thought that'd be weird.
All sides are wrong.
You were biking on the wrong side
Exact same!!!
Guys there is someone on campus dressed in the same trex costume as the one in the prono I sent yall

It only barely beat the transcontinental railroad, which was discovered in 1996 to actually be a roller coaster
Covering their tracks
Jet fuel can't melt steel beams, but roller coasters can.
Yeah for decades no one noticed the roller coaster tracks leading directly into the world trade center
It was a 2001 cgi reenactment for the newsreels.
And also 9/11
Yeh

It is still my favorite zelda song
I felt that way about the skyward theme
beauty
zelda music isnt designed with fades though, its just easily implemented when they make soundtracks
WELL I DONT
its just designed to be on loop
I love video game music is so extendable
I just want to use it to listen to music
I seriously want this game now
gonna do my homework to this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8huuWx1c4ac
so good
when that guitar kicks in
fuck yes
Cool
how about overwatch?
tf2
wanna play mac?
fucking brillaint
spitting mechanics
Illagers
fuck
you hope
and the password is: MacCookie69
but the username is my email
I don't know
yeah you want my hulu?
probably best
Everyone made fun of my writing on the website
Smart Nintendo
So if you want your computer to read it, it needs to format the card
Oh that's right the wii formats the memory card so computers can't read it
But I'm sure there are ways around it now
I remember trying that as a kid and there is some encryption that prevents that.
Not without jailbreaking
Only move
Because you can't copy game channels
Wii though isn't as complex
The game files on there are system locked which sucks
I wish I could do it with 3ds but you cant
It's really nice.
From the system to the memory card, which I can then use in any system
I'm not copying I'm moving
If I did a system transfer I wouldn't be able to accumulate only replicate
No.
I'm moving the game channels onto a memory card.
Like I have Mario RPG, snap, ocarina, donkey 64, and like every nes game on the Eshop from doing this
Every time a wii comes in, if it has any games on it I save them to a memory card before I format it
Wii
Mac I have a 32 gb memory card that I steal woo games from.
Lol
No one has access to that computer accept Ron.
Won't it only be on the corporate computer though?
That way all the go daddy stuff is consistent.
Just make it the same
I mean why does it need to be secured?
He doesn't have his email password memorized
He won't be able to remember anything.

GWorld0!
Because the peons on this site are dense af
https://vgmradio.com/
ive never seen anything so abandoned
i just went in the chatroom
just got bumped
oh shit
mines third
lol aight
i saw
im putting this on the store's pipeline
warcraft 2 has the best music
i requested the age of mythology song
seriously though whoever this person is who keeps requesting dkc stuff, why dont they just fucking listen to the soundtrack
did you request the zelda
who keeps fucking voting for dkc
classic
"welcome to the world of warcraft"
"welcome to the age of chaos"
nah dog its pretty good
I liked it
lol
when i dont want to have to sort through youtube playlists
this is something i can use at work which is nice
(also the main thing is i cant play my songs at work)
also the songs on my computer are all songs ive heard before
and im not always in the mood for nintendo
like even on random it will be like 75% nintendo music
yeah but my music is weighted properly
I also like how they have a leveling up mechanic for their songs
but its nice because it is random
I feel like i have more videogame music saved on my computer than they have in their system
they have age of mythology
but mac
which to be fair 95% of all games are jrpgs
its like 95% jrpgs
yeah
http://www.rpgamers.net/radio/
also, I just discovered this shitty website for discovering new videogame music
And once I get half of this done I will reward myself with drawing pictures of Mario for you

Depending on whether or not my friday plans fall through (which i hope they do) I can do that time as well, if not we will have to saturday or sunday morning
yeah, its in a very congested area, not good for biking.
Its no problem though to drive you
to the westside store?
I woudnlt feel comfortable with you doing that
I'll have to give you a ride also
k, I'll talk to Ron about that
yup
okay so maybe we can do that this weekend?
and wait until it is up?
okay, so maybe hold off then?
what days are you availbe before five during the week, and we can also do the weekend morning
Also monday would you want me to get you an updated inv file?
putting the thing on his computer
also when are you free to scheudle that thing with Ron?
I guess, if you are comfortable with how it is right now
as far as placeholders go, I'm trying to get all my homework for mon, tuesday, wednesday done today so i can do that tomorrow
(monday)
as i give it to the managers
feedback will probably be trickling in throughout the week
with a bunch of shitty stand up
it was like a house show
which one?
I went to a terrible fucking comedyh show last night
is that like the data value or something for both of those thing?
ecphoneme is an exclamation mark

Day two of the epic debate
Mac
Mac you wanna go grocery shopping with me.
You can play bowser.
I don't know if that's a compliment or not
Ron is very impressed with the site mac
mac when do you want to hang
But bikers definitely trigger my road rage which is funny.
But really it only is a problem on one lane roads.
It's not wasting my energy, just slowing me down.
I'm way more pissed by giant trucks that go just as fast as bikes because they are harder to pass
But my thought is that if I am passing them, then it's not actually a problem.
While still not being a dumb ass and putting yourself at risk.
I don't mind the red lights because if you bike you know that you want to conserve momentum and energy as much as possible
I think that bikers are obnoxious but as long as they are staying safe it is just something you need to get over.
I like how I'm the only one here who represents both groups.
Mac I'm about to meet with Ron.
Anything I should ask.
I mean to be fair that's why there needs to be more bike lanes.
Bikes have a huge initial acceleation but then expontentially decreases.
Whereas cars can just sustain whatever they want, but it takes them longer to get there
bikes accelerate faster than cars...
also ronald cars accelerate faster than cars
Yo so when do we wantt to hang?
Yeah I think they need to be kept in their respective spheres.
THats pretty cool
also mac the bowser fights are so consistenly epic
ds
these mechanics are so great, why isnt every rpg like this
genius
also blorbz
Also I made sure to not delete your save file because you have 30 hours on it
a green mustache shield
Luigi just has higher hp because they are expecting you to use him as a human shield
mario is way too op
what even is this meta
luigi's stats are shit
I will just rent dream team, but also I love how passive agressive the game is when you skip all the tutoirals
makes me want to play saga and partners in time
This is legit making me nostagic for all of the rpgs though
not that we are inside him
because i thought inside story was refering it to being a bowser origin story
Im a little disappointed though
but theyve always had that in the rpgs
i love the gibberish ittalian
Emoglobin
Globin is my new favorite video game character
Just played the first 25 minutes of inside story and holy shit you werent kidding
I will
Sounds good
I don't regret that
not for posting
for not being quiet i mean
sorry

I mean yeah its a shit show company
hi-rez?
He makes a lot of references to it in his videos
I love how much he shits on this game
Have you watched the stardew valley lore video?
Fair.
But how the indie market is showing way more promise

lust for attention
THey didn't address my lust üò¶
the pop out

just tried
you just tug and pull until you get something good
Its exactly like eating beef jerky
I've got big teeth so it probably would end in visceral terror
for Harambe
Ronald we know you would do it
just to make up for it
I cant imagine I'd be good at it, so I'd probably have to end up paying the guy
but the oppurtunity has never presented itself
You say that
oh a lot less
which is only like worth 200
I'd suck a dick for all twelve issues of watchmen
...beardless
mac's beadless face, pure and fresh as a maiden's
LOL
I want me some fresh boy
I actually started crying
fuck

UGH SO TRUE

I'm at a party.
I'm still resisting temptation.
Reminds me of the good days
Look at you good ol boys playin dota

I have already lost the desire for 3dpd
I think having her there made me play the "foil" so i had to turn it down a bit
but i did really well
yeah it was really a bad idea not masturbating before hand yesterday
four just to be safe
because i booked it home after my shift to avoid temptation
I have to work with her again tonight though, which is going to be awkward
if they havent already
mac has us beat
it also helped that she had my sister's name which is a major turn off
but i didn't!
because i was like, yeah i should just go ahead and sleep with her
I was really proud
I know!
I'm pretty sure that was sexual harassment
and then started touching me a lot
literally within the first hour she was like "man i really need to get laid tongiht"
nope
it was weird
and then started grabbing my ass
the girl i was working with invited me over at least four times
no
For the first time in my life I resisted sensual temptation
https://youtu.be/mUZiUC-kHj8

btw those mechs are suppose to be the size of the milkyway
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eab5d38UOxE
this is my favorite thing done by them
they know there shit that animation studio
becuase i would always skip episodes with guest animators
i wonder how many kids actually watched this all the way through
I'm watching it now actually
ill need to watch it
yeah
honestly a lot of his stuff just reminds me of a higher quality asdf
but nothing is quite like that
yeah his stuff is interesting

THIS IS FUCKING GENIUS
how did you essay go?

If only it wasn't banned in the states
givin head to the F.B.I
you were sucking uncle sam's dick
you didnt even play most of the summer

fall used to be my least favorite season because I had to do soccer from 5-15
it was not an exciting part of my life
true
I forgot I did soccer
Sigh I've been there

üò¶
Ronald, do you know what I am fucking craving right now?
So sad
At least join call?
Yes
Cool can we join up when you finish?
K
Is that a yes?
Anyone want to play?
Because we are lewd boys
I like to see how many they can fit
I go whole hog
Hell I fit the whole goddamn thing
Ladies dig it
More flexibility that way
I'm flaccid
I have so many ideas now on what I want to do to the photo of Ronald, but I can't decide if I want to use my free time to photoshop or play games.
Easy
Yeah
True
I probably will as soon as I get home.
Honestly.
I'm just scared that if I do Ronald will post all those nude photos he has of me
Don't make me use photoshop

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Controlling
I can't seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced
That there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall

My entire point of saying that though was trying to show how it couldn't easily be as wrong.

I definitely can see how it's right though.

I'm just using all my relatives do
A lot of lower middle class people browse eBay to look for things they want/need.
Whereas Amazon you mostly go on when you want something specofic
Just that more people browse it
Not saying it's better
Whereas craigslist and eBay are designed to browse
You usually go on Amazon looking for something you need.
Yeah but more people browse eBay than amazin
A lot of people
I learned that from gameworld
Yahoo is shockingly well used
Xvideo definitly deserves that rank
Gotcha
Where is Facebook
I 100% believe that list
Although the recently changed their entire platform and it's really pissing me off

Id be down to try it out
Nice.
Can it run on my computer?
Is that the one where you can throw me?
Is it multiplayer?
Chat?
Can I play?
Overwatch?

Wifi is back!!!!
My skin is itching.
I'm going through withdrawl
Still no wifi
I think they just need to bring back lucioball
Rigged against people without friends
While gossiping about Asher and Ronald.
That's true I could actually just bring my tablet and computer and we could work on it.
And books are for nerds
Because I'm running out of comics
Depending on whether or not I actually get wifi back I may take you up on that.
Aight
But what if you have a girl over?
In.my.room.and
I was really looking forward to watching Hulu:-(
Thanks
Day two without Internet...my soul grows weary.
Aww
Well my wifi seems like it is fried.
So I have to live like a peasant
Storm just knocked out my internet
yeah ill play
sorry i was goine
So til that the transformers wiki is a joke
Yeah.
We just need to actually start practicing it
But we actually need push strats
I just have trouble when I don't have a healer
I'm not to bad with her in pub games
I can learn zarya
So considering there are four of us now, I really think we need to start coming up with try hard team strats
Sorry to disappoint
That was the goal
I personally use l33t
I played com mercy this morning.
I did that without even thinking about it.
Fucking broken
Fuck

"great that will be ready in ten minutes"
"uh, no"
"can i have a name please?"
but then i remember cooking sucks
this makes me want to cook so bad
its fascinating to see how his humor writing evolved
thanks for showing this to me
"echoes of an afternoon"
yeah
because hes actually cooking
if you chould write something of this caliber about computers, people definitly would
but he actually has a skill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6MJe5wKT7Y
the cool thing about the catepillar is that it denotes freshness
"devon"
sometimes the differences are what makes a friendship strong
I really like these
lol
unless you hate it
youre gonna love it
its interesting to see the evolution there
lol
its very well made
lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBdQIa4rt78
this dude has the exact same intonations as this guy
9 cents cheaper
ronald why aint you playin wit us/
I only eat like 5 meals a week not including breakfast so this could actually save me some money
I sort of want to try this.
https://www.blueapron.com/pages/pricing
I really wish they would bring back warioware
So they better
Yeah but the last three have been shit
Yeah, hopefully it'll be better than the last one.
I think games like Mario party are perfect for it
I would love to see Mario multiplayer done on a larger medium like mobile gaming though.
Lol
10
Where I imagine over 80% have a smart phone.
I know you are joking but if you think about it less than 50% of people in this town have a 3ds
So if you could make like a Mario party like game that works like "words with friends" it would be fucking amazing.
But pretty much everyone has a smartphone.
Because not everyone has a 3ds and even less people have wii us
The only way I care is if they create a good multiplayer.
Because that's what Nintendo should be utilizing apps for
Whatever:)
Because those are genuinely well made platformers
Also Mac have you played any of the rayman mobile games?
Eh well I've bought some games within this year that I genuinely enjoy
What was it?
More than a dollar?
When's the last time you paid for a game?
You don't know that though.
Whereas 5 years ago they would.
No one wants to pay more than a dollar for a game they know they won't play for very long anymore.
I think there are still good games they are just impossible to find, because the most downloaded games are the free ones.
Doodle jump
I still like marvel puzzle quest
The first pvz was optimized for mobile though.
And plants v zombies is actually a good tower defense game
And they were good on iOS
But games like bastion and world of goo had mobile launches
Also tiny wings wasn't bad.
And jelly cars
Games like solipskier had really good mechanics
Back when the App Store first launched they were actually pretty good
Lol Mac you haven't played 99% of mobile games
works for me
wanna play?
pineapple
If it doesn't have birds in it, it won't succeed.
I have a theory about apps
Lol
You are one of the 1% that owns a wii u
Lol
Why?
It's okay it's still for casuls
Sony
Songs about to get in on it too
Pokemon go changed everything
Yup
I need to stop.
I promised I wouldn't let Mac find out about my sin
I just realized how good I've been about not bringing up my sexual adventures to you guys until now.
How do you know I haven't?
Lol.
I knew my role so didn't really care.
I just thought there was someone in the closet filming me.
Eh, it's her business.
That's amazing.
She just sort of said something about it to me after round 2 at which point I became extremely paranoid.
Lol
Sounds healthy
Luckily it was not
Well apparently she was in a relationship so I thought that was her kink.
Asher what I never told you though is that I was super nervous because I thought I was being used in an elaborate cuckolding plot
Oh wait you were asleep for that nm
Not counting that one time we literally touched dicks
You gotta

Tfw you're the only one that knows you just shit in the ocean
If I get my homework done I will.
Ding dong muthafuckas.
Ronnie boy is here
lol
but it is just him dying - being resurected - and dying again
he got play of the game
best play ive ever seen
https://gfycat.com/CourageousQuerulousFeline
Lol
Gotta
You gottw
Ugtifhj
Or Frankenstein
Lol
?
ü§ñ
Can't remember:)
Mac can be belezebub and you can be lucifer
Too bad we can't get Ronald in on that
She's about his size
We should hook her up with Mac
I wonder what Mac thinks of all of this
We are brothers
But since you brought it up, I might as well
I've been debating telling you that for a while
Lol
What a gal
But yeah that too
No I meant she just poorly kept it
That poor poor thing
She had a rabbit
Lol
I'm going to be honest, this kinda connection is all I've ever wanted with you.
Swamp thing right?
I offered.
She said she was going to bring it to you.
Saw it in her table
Yeah I noticed that
Kol
That's what I said
And you slept on her floor
Yup
She only said that she was originally trying to hook you up with her friend.
You were a mutual connection
Yup
I was supposed to bring you your comic:-)
Details are a bit fuzzy
We watched South Park.
Went three times.
I showered and went home.
I don't remember.
I'm not going to lie.
Yup
Not much to tell, pretty forgettable.
Just a quick hookup
Yeah
Yeah
Laura?
Or whatever her name is
Did I tell you that I slept with her?
Probably should've created a contact for her.
As is evidenced by the lady whose name I can't remember that texted me this morning.
I'm doing pretty fine being a whore without having to try actually
He's the best joker Ronald.
Honestly if I just walk into the fine arts building with "damaged" on my forehead I'd be swimming in poon
Lol
I promise
I have yet to flirt with her
I honestly don't feel comfortable flirting in any environment that isn't amongst friends or on the Internet.
I don't want to add to that struggle
And they have to deal with a gaggle of horny guys doing the same thing
Because cons are supposed to be safe spaces.
Yeah but that would be morally wrong
But who was phone?
I I'm siding with cunt Dracula on this one
But it's just very clearly a ring of the wedding variety
It's not decorative though.
And there is an entire folder dedicated to wedding dresses....
Also I maybe stalked her Pinterest
It's not decorative at all
Because it's a wedding ring that she is wearing on her ring finger
This is a wedding ring, my dude.
Weak
My mental faculties are week
I refuse to ask about it
I don't know.
Every temptation.
All of them
I created a physical barrier to resist temptation.
To leave room for Jesus.
The cosplay chick is sitting next to me again I I put my backpack between us.
When is it?
Can I go?
so we can have a new years party
I may do that, you should also considering coming over this year for winter break
Comics
It's in Durham
Ronald, there is a convention in November that I kinda want to go to
And I go by cholical now
I already knew.
Yup
Lol
Mac, what do you think will be more documented 1000 years in the future: the first 150 Pokemon or the 150 psalms
Fair
Yeah but you counted those as different but not the 2ds
More differences than between the ds and ds lite
Which is why it's not a full gen different
The software alterations between the two are minor
But there are more differences between the 2ds and 3ds than there are the 3ds and new 3ds
Yeah.
Well then if you count those as different systems you'd also have to include the game boy micro and pocket
Is that separating 3ds and new 3ds?
Good choice
Lol
Or a Mario
They only know it as a Nintendo
Or the Genesis
I always just call it a Sega Saturn
Idk
Lol
Although I call it Xbox the 1st, to be confusing
Xbox
No it's plAYstATion
But was useless because it was right before the 64 came out
Took it from 16 to 32 bit
So there are different games for it
Like if you plugged in an addition to make a ds a 3ds
It was an addition to the Genesis
Yeah
Sega 32x
Sega saturn
Is there any product in that category?
Don't know



The best super villian
Yup
Dreamcast
Yeh
Marvel turned Donald trump into modok
Holy fuck

I'm sure it is
I can barely make it through and episode at a time.
If I ever see it for sale on blu ray I'm getting it.

üòâ
I sort of want to take a break and play overwatch.
Lol
Also you have a German last name
Or calling a Canadian British then
Because they speak English
That's like calling a Canadian American
Lol
Or one universal one
Not every country has its own language
Yeah
You know mercy isn't German right?
That's a good play.
Link
Good thing once you graduate all you will have is money to prioritize so it won't matter
Good thing you don't get paid to do real homework.
Honestly you recalled more than I can off the top of my head.
It's off a bit, but it's written better than the actual creed
Service is #1
But Asher...
Because people buy Mario games
Chat
Why aren't you guys in char
Thanks!
Sometimes I just think you are trying to invalidate me
but i knew the song
actually i got it from polygon
lol
Asher I actually know what this is from!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=62&v=B0EJ3pMgQTE
There are actually services that pay you for emails
How much money do you think I could get if I sold that list?
Yeah that would be irresponsible.
I can not disclose sensitive game world information.
No it's harambe's

His name is vitas
Need more?

Lisa is a lot of fun
That's why you only play Nintendo games.
You just need to get good
Lol
Dkc returns I mean
It has very good bosses but decently challenging levels
Dkc is not that bad
How can you suck at dkc?
K bud
Surprisingly
There are no spoilers
Actually no
This is the best thing marvel had made yet.
http://youtu.be/bPNBKT6JLSU
I'll play
Lol
Loo
Hmm



So it still had demand
It's considered the best Mario RPG on the 3ds
You'd be surprised.
Nintendo games drop their prices slowly.
33.99 sounds like the best you'll get in town
Then it's your best bet
I think your best bet is waiting until around December and I bet you there will be a price drop
Depends on the game obviously
Because people will buy it for that much
Game stop has it listed for 34.99
Right.
But bestbuy doesn't loose money off of that, whereas all the businesses that have to compete with those prices do.
No.
A lot of stores underprice games they don't have in stock to cut the competition
Yeah a lot of store do thar
So if they have it for cheaper you can get that price
We price match with GameStop though
No you are right it's not
20 is the Nintendo select orice
You sure?
Probably because Nintendo just made it a Nintendo select
I'll take photos of it when I'm there
Right?!
Idk I'll be at work later I'll check for you
Those will be the benefits
She can make me costumes.
I'm so okay with being her friend.
Haven't asked
Married chick and I are going to the comic store after class.

Meredith is somehow more annoying than she was in highschool.
anyone want to get a few games in?
i remember that
lol
I made jokes about her all the time during the class
yeah dawg
I feel like she was more in the color guard and marching band sphere
you dont remember her from mr hayes class?
shes more fit than any of us
hard core backmuscles going on
https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1002603763187756&set=ecnf.100003144254947&type=3&theater
she is tan and has muscles
she looks really different
she just looked upset when i asked if i knew her
So Meredith Buckley had been sitting next to me in every class and she finally got pissed that I didn't recognize her.
She definitely shares your pout.
I'm going to go die now
She's got a ring on the left ring finger.
Engaged
I want to lick so bad

i get to talk to her tomorrow without it being weird
to talking with her
I have an in
I'm going to murder the male.
It was nice
She walked up and was like "you are in my comics class." And then we talked.
Yeah
So I think he may be a friend.
But she  literally walked up and talked to me without me saying anything
Yeah
She has a boy friend
It's unmuted.
I can't hear you guys either
I'm trying to talk
I figure you don't want to hear me pee

I'm distracted from my flow chart
...yeah
Shailey
They do that a lot with sexual assault charges
Else the school would look bad
So rather than creating a case they just suspended him
IU didn't want to bring it to trial
There was evidence but not enough to convict
Well he is suspended from IU because of a rape that he very much did commit but they can't prove
Do you know about Chris?
Dude...too soon
Indiana comic expo
Convention.
And if so I'll "casually" recognize her
She may be at the convo I'm working tomorrow
Yeah that's the plan
I can't just go adding people willie nillie
And no I have to go about this systematically ronald
Mac threatened to send my chat with him to her
That's where we started Ronald
I'm going to loose it
She cried during the overwatch cinematics and loves daredevil
Or just open my mouth and release thousands of bees at her
They would just see two different people from different parts of the country stalking one person
I like how if the nsa saw this right niw
That seems like something a liberal would do
Shit
She probably wasn't old enough to vote

I thought the ring represented her bull-like attitude towards market trends
Well...I guess forget it then

How's your computer Ronald?
There are a lot of things I'm not happy about:-)
But part of me thinks that of I stop having sex on a regular basis I will de
I feel like there are a lot of things I should stop doing.
Yeah...
Kessler is apparently on tinder now.
I would have to agree with that
How are you these days mac?
Nothing
Uuugh
Jesus I want to
Since when is having your pants down to your ankles while crying "coming on too strong"?!
I met a beautiful drum lady but I apparently "came on too strong"
Lol
This needs to be an emote
üôÖüôÜüôé
Nah.
i was raging when we lost those first two ticks because only two people were dead but no one was on point
theres really only one place to do it on hanumara and no one ever goes there
i didnt get one environment kills
no
lol which one was that objective time?
I had four gold medals that match, including eliminations
and junkrat's is chacal which means jackal which honestly makes more sense than trash mouse
because they read "roadhog" as meaning a motorcycle, which makes sense
so apparently roadhog's french name is chopper
Neither do I.
2011
I'm not big into mods
I spend 85% of my time in vanilla with games like this so it doesn't really matter
Not enough to run fallout better than my ps4
I wouldn't be able to play it
I can't wait for console mods because I can barely get through my third play through.
Because of you start with mods you'll never be able to go back to vanilla
I would not install mods for now
When you get far enough I into the game I also have a video for you
Yeah why not
Do you not have Friday classes?
ula
penis
PENIS
come play
ron
rib
yes
Thanks Ronald.
I thought you were talking comics...
I got really excited for a second
I'm heading home now to gsme
Although I guess not actually considering profs do move between universities fairly frequently.
That's spooky.
speaking of whihc, i love playing zarya now
wow
I still just hear Waga tiki wow oh wow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNakJDWws5Q
Ryuu ga waga teki wo kurau = Dragon, eat my target
he is saying lots of books
is this some sort of rap music?
wasnt talking to you
we do?
Maybe in like 15
RON
ronald?\
i miss ron
so we playin?
üò¶
the comments make me sad
but saftey is for pussies
now remember the importnace of saftey
i love this
I mean worst case scenario you could always become my hays
so dont feel too bad
including english
I suck at all languages
becuase of how much we have in common...
I just get angry everytime he talks
lol
The league of conditioners
probably make more than ill ever make
and it is the worst thing ever
and i know for a fact that i cant ignore him becuase he speaks during lectures
In every english class ive ever taken at iu a guy named "Vinnie" has also been in it
thats not available all the time though mac
but yeah its not fucking worth it
so its getting closer to that the higher you go
although 3 of my classes this year have 5 people in them who are only there because they are interested in the subject matter
yeah
and we had to turn in our notes to make sure they were proper
I remember in the sixth grade we literally had a unit on note taking
primarily because public education is designed to teach you both the material and how to learn
yeah
the rest is attendance
20% each
it is just three papers and an exam
university history classes are beyond easy
or i guess the very year it came out
mainly because thay was before minecraft
i feel like often times i was way more studious then than i was my junior year of highschool
I feel like the 8th grade part isnt really a brag
you didnt get a's in latin?
i didnt say you are good at everything....
which boils down to natural intellegence and dicsipline, so for you it doesnt mattter how you study
i mean all points are moot anyway because i assume you have been consistently making a's since birth
and if mac and ronald do im game
becuase you dont have to cypher throuhg the readings looking for what is importnat
i dont think they make it faster, just easier
i feel like notes dont dictate how much you study just aid the process of studying
what do you study then?
lol
ive had so many arguements with mac where his general point is "well i dont have to work very hard so..."
yeah he does that
a = b = c
Mac = Keenan = GF
adds a "human interest" to the class
keeps me on my toes
Its okay I pick one person to stalk in every class
and not get caught?
so we can do better next time?
"to learn from hitler mistakes"
otherwise it would be awkward
the prerequisite is "no jews allowed"
(so true)
ive just been putting on a wig and deepening my voice this whole time
Am your girlfriend
I
its time we tell you the truth truth
Asher...
there is nothing wrong with a little light stalking
is he in another class with her?
get back
every time i get mac to school all the student make me think of this song
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUFSB2plwzM
so okay with that
else ill forget
if only for a bit
just make sure you join voice tonight ronald
lol
yeh
its just something only you would appreciate
no
beucase i want to tell you over voice
ronald i have something i need to tell you so make sure you are in chat tonight
i have a 3:30 hour one
yikes
k
I can get a few games in in the next couple of hours if anyone wants to join?
yeah give me 15

jews and blacks

.......
myaaaac
cum
maaac
anyone dtp?
yeh
i told everyone in my game to hydrate just now
I know gauge time by how many lucioball games I can get in
Ah
Why is that
You load into your game.
Your team needs water.
You random Morphling.
You start off with bottle and 3 clarities.
You tell everyone "Remember to stay hydrated"

You have an intense desire to keep everyone hydrated

You buy mana water boots and 3 infused raindrops

You morph str and stun the enemy Lich for 4.5 seconds.
You watch as your teammates Slardar, Naga, Kunkka and Slark melt him.
You do this until the game is won.
Congratulations now you are hydrated.
Aight
I'll be home a little after 7
I'm at work
Iceberg
Oh shit
Yeah so I only have today to get it
I got literally every skin but that one
-just blew $10 to try to get that McCree skin...
join me
üò¶
I'll get it tonight.
You.
Fuck.
It's not like we need to ration them or anything
Don't know why all these dummies only use like 2-8 gbs of ram when there are so many gbs out there.
Better go with 500gb
Well gee whiz I guess I better do the same.
Oh I'm sure.
I was trying not to link to an actual virus Mac
Jesus there was almost no frame rate drop during that explosion.

Lol

nah
ronald why dont you just have discord open on your laptop while you play?
i bet you it would work with a wireless headset though
that sucks
ugh
i use the audio from my headphones but the voice is from the built in speaker
mine doesnt
i still havent found a soltion
mine do the same thing
i dont know, ive never been able to get my mics to work on my desktop
k
why üò¶
what about ronald
where yall at :(?
On my way back
Look at this expert organization of information.
http://www.theshadowlands.net/places/indiana.htm
Like actually navigate it.
http://theshadowlands.net/
Look at this expert web design.
Mac.
Why is the audio so low on my phone?
It's at max but you are really quiet
I just want to hear you build
üò¶
I'm on my phone at sams
Please don't get burnt out before I get back...
I'm at SAMs but I'll try to leave around 8:30-9
yeah
asher are home
because i didnt think think they actually recorded anything
who is that team on the music?
fuck yes
is there a link?
fuck
this made me shed a tear by the way
did not know pearl was asian
mac
üò¶
lol
yeah join us
did you just leave?
lets do it
aight
ronald wanna do one game with me real quick while i wait for my dishes to be done?
Hype
New pokemon
They probably suck
I've had a few three stars before
Lol
Obviously considering I love final fantasy and Pokemon.
I like tbs just not those specific kind.
Pokemon conquest was the closest I could do.
I have nothing against fe specifically.
I just don't really like those kind of games in general
The best fe game is melee
That's how I feel about fire emblem too
True.
That slippy mission is the best
Lol.
That's not nintendos fault though, it's gamefreaks
I also feel that way about star fox but at least they tried with the last game
It's the worst Nintendo game I've played in a long time.
I think Nintendo officially hates Samus.
Have you seen play footage of the new Metroid game mac?
Lol
Why not orange?
Have you never seen my computer Ronald?
My fan is rainbow led
Yeah you can
He has it so it changes based on specific software he's using.
I hate it
Sam has that.
Mayonnaise is not a color.
No Patrick
If I sell my ps4 this year I could probably get enough for just a new graphics card
Are you going to mod your desktop Ronald so you can be all cool?
i decided that if im still playing overwatch in november ill make a computer
i only use vista
becuase i jelly
üò¶
me think
seems like he is a fucking liar
hmm
lol
üáØüáµ
nah
join us
maaaaaac
lol
wrecker
gigawreacker
its a main programmer at gamefreak
steam
i know how into boetheus you are mac
ahahaha
yeah gamefreak made a decent looking puzzle platformer
lol
it looks really cool
no
yeah i first watched the theatrical cut which made me think it was a shitty movie for a long time
but i doubt that will be the case
i was honestly hoping they were going to do a prometheus thing where it was just two selfcontained stories within the same world
yeah...
lol is he playing the protagonist or is it just a cameo?
also mac, gamefreak just came out wiht a new game and it looks super fun
yeah...
so now he can ruin two of my favorite things?
lol, did you hear jared leto was just casted for the blade runner sequel?
i think it is just the mobile app
honestly my phone is brand new and still needs to do that every now and again
i love the things you are online for
k ill put on my robe and wizard hat
mac you three
ronald join voice
Yeah I just found some headphones today and they are Bluetooth but o well
I probably don't.
...
Does window 8 do Bluetooth?
K let me say bye to my family then I'll play
Can I have yours then:-)
I need to find a way to sync my headset
Give me like 10-15
I'll join
Lol
Looks like shit
...
üò¶
Yo you all free to play tonight?
Good.
You've got to make sure to sterilize it
Did you wash everything first?
He is a turtle
But here's the twist....
He terminates turtles.
It makes sense
He's the turtonator.
Lol
I love the name turtonator btw
Wtf is this.
Teletubbies?!
Are they just showing it again?!
New Pokemon btw
It's cool because now it makes sense as to why torbjorn and rein are so racist to robots.
And the bindissac enojii
Wall-e 2
Literally bambi
Yeh
Need it
Need that skin
Ooooioooooiooooooo
Ooooooo
Ooooooooo
Lol
Rip
Aldrich:-(
At least that's what it seemed.
Yeah
I really like that choke point in front of the castle door
Same.
I was watching gameplay stream on that map this morning and it looks fun
Lol
What do you think the next hero will be?
Yeah Jeff is not charismatic at all
Lol I'm watching that rn
It is a straight up beginners course.
Illustrator and photoshop
Cheatsheet
Yeah I wanna make a nice chestsheet
I honestly just want a class that teaches me hotkeys
But I feel like it will teach me shit I can use for hobby
Just a basic one.
Yeh
Did I tell you I signed up for a graphic design class?
Like no matter the graphics every game they make feels 3-5 years older than it actually is.
Ea amazes me because they still make games but their interfaces still look ten years old
Like if ea made Pokemon go it would have ads and every time you were trying to catch a Pokemon an ad for Pokemon go plus would pop up.
Yeah but if they did that along with having a bunch of spammy shit in their games then they would be as bad.
Niantic is not nearly as bad as ea
Yeah but I'm still grateful anytime a company isn't ea
Or blizzard circa 2007
For not being ea
So good job blizzard
Which you don't really see in non subscription or freemium based games.
They clearly want to build a good relationship with the growing playerbase
And it's not like one thing every couple of months.
It's like a major update every 3-4 weeks
Yeah but they didn't need to follow up with that promise.
It's really nice that they did.
But I mean honestly considering that overwatch is a paid game in surprised they are putting as much effort into patches as they are
Hearthstone took over a year to get fine though.
And Starcraft was the same way
They did the same with Starcraft, hearthstone and hots
Yeah but that's blizzard
K
But that's pretty much true with any game.
I mean yeah.
Although the nerfs will probably make genji f tier so maybe they should hair make everyone f tier
I mean all the characters getting buffs are f tier so it's getting closer
I mean yeah
Likes now I want to practice zennie
Although it is nice because constantly nerfing and buffing characters forces you to try new ines
Lol

Definitely not they way you want a fps balanced
I'm so fucking angry I'm having a hard time focusing at work:-(
I didn't realize that after the last patch no one has been playing mercy
Eric my friend/ manager comes in today though so I'm just gonna bitch at him.
I'm gonna post it on the Facebook though.
Because he doesn't check that
Yeah
And was pretty proud of the Pokemon stadium reference.
Yeah but I spent like 2 hours on that dumb thing
I actually cried...

It took 2 minutes.
He said it was genius.
So here's what I did instead
He said they drew attention away from the sale.
So the owner decided not to use the signs I made
Playing on competitive.
Good genii players can essentially just jump over anything.
Agree
I disagree.
So just don't be dumb and throw it at his shield.
Like it just freezes the ground around him
Does it technically go through a shield anyway.
Lol
And then maybe increase the cool down time.
I really think they need to give him a one second speed boost after he rolls
Mccrees is unfortunately a nerf
Hanzo and me I definitely got the biggest buffs
I agree to the sucking part
Nice
they will be changing mccree but they havent said what they are doing yet
http://www.polygon.com/2016/8/17/12526670/overwatch-patch-genji-nerf
You
Fuck
Lol
It's three within 6 minths
That's not true
Because I'm sexy
Luckily he lied on the ticket.
39
Don't you have to take a class?
There goes my pay
Just got my first speeding ticket
I'm faster
Yeah but without traffic in faster
100 though
No
But I'm getting paid so I don't really care
Yeah all the parents are on the road now:-(
To pick someone up from the airport.
Driving to indy
It is literally car to car for as long as I can see
I don't know but I'm stuck in super heavy traffic so I doubt I'll be able to play actually.
Cool I'll probably play a few before Philip comes over.
üò¶
So people know I love my country.
I want the America McCree skin so bad.
Bastions origin is so sad
I don't think Ronald will play competitive with you.
D-:

O really this whole time I thought it meant 48 people could beat me...
Prob
Prib
You'll probably get a higher ranking
üò¶
I'm busy tonight so I needed to do it
48:-(


Awwww guess what bitch
join the voice chat then
wanna get rowdy?
yo
I miss ronald
lol

this is the most annoying thing ive ever seen
Let's go boi
Garbage boi is sturdier than I thought.
My dick is out in deep concentration for the celestial mind spirits of Harumbe.
I feel victory coursing through my erect, Ape-like ding dong.
This garbage boy just made a blunder so any second now
It's almost over though.
Give me a bit I'm playing chess with me granddad
Coo
If I use ascii graphics?
Can I get that on my pi?
Yo can I run overwatch on raspberry pi?
Aight
Boys
Yo you fuckers free to play tonight?
Coo
Pratchett is my favorite author.
He's very famous, he made the entire discworld series
It's a comedy about the book of revelations
It's in my top 10 probably
Yup
Asher also recommended a scifi book to me which I've been enjoying called snow crash
Lol k the prose in Dresden isn't the best but I really like the characters and tend to think the mysteries are well put together.
But the prose in good omens are fantastic.
Yeah Dresden is about a wizard detective though it is more detective then magic shit.
To see if you find it funny or not.
Also I think you should read good omens
Hmm.
Well I sort of think you would like the Dresden files.
Though I'm not a fan of the first one
Eh, what are you in the mood for?
Yeah actually but I'll have to browse tomorrow to see what is available to you.
The bible
im playing now
http://dani-pedrosas.tumblr.com/post/148906096846/theseprezelsaremakingmethirsty
yo someone get in chat with me
WHO DO I BELIEVE?!
Ha
Lol
Lol
Storm spirit though (obnoxious af)
Same
My beautiful decaying boy
My boy
Pudge
Roadhog!
!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!
She's an ugly fish lady
I'm so glad Naga is banned
That's what you think
He's memorizing the tier list
Of euro truck sim
Gotta understand the meta
Lol
And radiant has a 100% win rate
Mainly because they are radiant
I'm leaning more towards DC
Then I'll like them
I'm simple like that
So I like them
They are using it
So
I want wing to win now
IO!
IO
IO
Timber=bitch
Bitch
Timber is a basic bit h
So pumped
Lol
Why won't they just release both?
Lol
What a boy
Who was playing him?
That slark game though.
Lol
That was awesome
Loo
What a floppy floppy gsme
Omg
!!!!!
That was amazing
FUCK!!!!
Gg
My boy
Slark has got this
Gg
Gg
Gg
Lol
Wasn't
That want worth it
Ugh
I'm watching dota
üò¶
Over
It's iber
Gg
I don't think so
Def not
So good
That fucking slark
Yeah
Bullshit
Fucking terror blade
DC playing a little too aggressive too
DC got this
Slarks gonna take top any minute now
Yeah
But they gotta do something soon
Yeah that's why DC still has a chance
Before the terror blade gets too fed
They just need to take that barracks in the next ten minutes
Same.
That was such a good push DC just did
That brewmaster kill steal was amazing
But bears
That ursa escape
They wont
Who wants to bet on this game?
Now I have to root for them
DC going with ursa.
Ugh!
Well I'll play rayman until then
so 60% for a team
Ever member of your party adds 10%
And I need my bonus 30%
We need chests
Overwatch
No
Because you weren't as good
That was bellow average
Average
That's about aberage
Same
I'm scheduled to 8 but like I said I will leave early
That's more of ana
Im@gonna try to leave work early because it's been forever since I've binged overwatch
But did you get the stun?
Sure it is Ronald
Ronald how would you feel if I became a McCree main?
üôäüôäüôäthe lack of gorilla emojis is disturbing
üòÑ
Ronald
Can we play tonight?
The internet isn't working at my work so I'm having a hard time watching:-(
Aight yeah
Eh I guess
Ugh so excited!!!!
Is this the only Chinese based dota hero?
Or a jump
Ugh
I love him so much.
He will probably have an extending staff abiliyu
I'm gonna get back into dota just to master monkey king
Not true Ronald.
The monkey King has been bastardized so many times and it never pisses the Chinese off
And also goku
Now I want a new wallet

Has tomorrow's lineup been finalized yet?
Chain wallet
Should I get
Dollars
30-50
At least they made up for it by black washing me
Couldn't depict a smart Asian, had to make him@white
Fucking america
I'm just gus
Though Ronald is shawn
Shawn Spencer ftw
Or a car
That's a massive donkey dick of a wallet
Mac is also not married apparently
Whoops
Same
...
Express
American rxpress
Does anyone even take that?
Maybe it's the same man
I've been having that same fantasy
Omg
Lol just do what my dad does and get a clip
My gay wallet is obese
True I just eat all of my change
The bigger the better
You need at least 40 flaps
Get a quadfold bifolds are kinda gay
Lol
Yeah?
It is stronger than leather
Tape
Lol make it out of duct twoe
Just get a purse
üò¶
I drew henry

Lol
I love you ronald
lol maybe counterstrike has subliminal messages that make you fat
look how old they are
whereas most of counterstrikes people were like between 15 to 20 when it came out
so they havent had time to get fat yet
because smash competetive didnt start until melee and most the poeple who are in the competetive scnee were only like 6 when it came out
two of the biggest esports
i like though how both dota and counterstrike are mods
lol
it totally is
competetive started the same year
yeh
but anyway counter strike is still older than dota
but they are all kids
how many people from ti though are from the dota 1 competetive scene?
that is what will happen to dota and smash players
thats because theyve been playing it for longer
like even at comiccons it is pretty easy to tell people apart mos tthe time
i love how esports are one of the few thiings where the pplayers and audience look the exact same
basically her job is to make a bunch of autistic assholes seem interesting
love her
are you back home yet?
nice
ive been triying to keep it a secret
teehee
and i love it
shes secretly a giant hairy man
yup
eh sort of
ive been good about not going on dates
trust me
oh this isnt really a date
yeh
and...other things
and then leave room for getting food
well we are going to toys r us, which likely wont take crazy long, and then going downtown after so thats like 4-5 hours
Because i will be there until probably tomorrow morning
my date

nope
ugh im so pissed im gonna miss all the games for today
this is what they do for women after the oscars

No you don't
Your mom.
I hate cosplay
This date is going well.
Though I am pissed I missed all the liquid matches
Tell me
What was the score 0-2?
Liquid lost?
too bad im going to miss this game
because of the rubick
im hoping luqid wins
matubaman
matpatbatman is kinda a dick
lol but then he found dota
i identify with casey
but i just rescheduled it so i can watch it

yup
It's because you liked it
The set up

im gonna have to watch it on my ipad so i can keep working on my comic
http://fox59.com/2016/08/11/fish-with-human-like-teeth-found-in-michigan-lakes/

they almost got that aa
nice
k

poops gold?
that alchemist is so farmed
shes got those legs
weaver is definitly sexier than tracer
kuku is having a hard time this match

this just makes me want to play chess
tracer
but basiccally racer
so like tracer
is fv ability like tracer?
fv is also sexy
oh there is actually a character called silencer

i missed it
k
when does game 2 start?
that drow did it for them
nice
nagas out
fucj
yeh
this is getting closer to even
k
cuukoo got cocky
üò¶
was that naga they just took out?
lol
neat
that was near
LOL
HE GOT OUT
FUCK
sure
yup
the morph and the drow are well fed now too
i heard that
batman:(
yeah
ahit
that sounds risky
so maybe they are trying to have their drow set up to just boost the rest of their heroes so they can end it early
fuck
right
why
why isnt tnc pushing while dc is rosh?
thats what i was just thinking
lol
yeah that morph is haivng toubles in mid
tnc is dominating
fuck
i didnt know tusk was a support
aight
is keeper supprt?
so hes good
but luckily hes farmed already up top
i remember that
gothca
yeh
because it divides farm?
that was a cool escape attempt for tusk though
that batriders gonna get pumped
fuck
so the batrider got all the xp?
aight]
for first blood?
is that early?
shit
too soon
k
tnc is radiant?
is morph late game or early game?
so what players on each team should i be paying attention to
i hope they pick void not sk
tusk is cute af
shit
mario tenis has the best meme community
no man
she is so boring
naga is always used
ehhh
what about it
i want to have twitch and discord open at the same time
shit thanks
so it is just the server chat
and take away the online and server list
is there anyway i can make it so just the discord caht is viewable
they all forgot something and stuttered on trying to remember it rather than moving on
that was very unprofessional of them just then
but this just reinforces it
i mean we all knew he was
mac
thats sexist ac
every interview sounds the exact same
is demon gay
becuase is sucked his big fat purple dick last night
but demon is gay
not heroes
no like actual players
becuase they all seem gay to me
how many dota players are gay
yikes
lol
'
becuase dont they also get a ban?
just taking turns between teams?
but like how do drafts work
how do i learn about drafting?
because i want to get an overwatch game in before it starts
what time is TNC playing DC?
nah
https://www.reddit.com/r/learndota2/comments/3eehu3/why_are_there_so_many_peruvians_on_us_east/
what about liquid?
...but i like navi...
can someone link me to the bracket
mac you need to watch the video
yeah but someone should explain every team playing this year and why they matter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py2LxgWBaRQ
some one needs to make this but with the teams not the game
jesus shadow demon is so sexy
k
what a bitch\
Did you see the school of fish pokemon
Chespin and oddish

More for me
I like dicks
That is my third favorite pokemon now

So cute
What even is Pokemon

And their Mirana was really good
It was like 22-17 or something like that
I'm so proud of them
They totally turned that around.
Yeah that was amazing
What a game!
!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!p
!!!!
I want them to turn this around.
But they sucked in the early game
Newbee better pull this off
Lol
Loo
What a play
Holy shit that turn around
Wow for once rule 34 has failed us
I'm sexually attracted to shadow demon
Rest in pieces
we should
yeah but hes been here since at least 2013
I told him why and he was like yeah ive been mixed up with him before
i need it to make an account
look at his name


i am
or are you too focused on TI
you guys wanna chat?
with a thermometer
Coolmaster is close
Corsair is my fav
Bu what brand
Because he's very aesthetically similar to you I feel
What case did sam recommend?
90% of the power should be taken up by the fans
And a big industrial fan right above it
You need at least thirty fans
They varied a lot
That way we don't have 45 copies of watch dogs
We do have a limit of how many of a certain game we take in though. 
No we dont
Bonus
Yeah every Tuesday we give out a bonis
No they weremt
There was literally a line of people each holding a giant box
But in the last hour
No
Jesus I just traded in over 600 games
As far as flexibility
Sounds like Pokemon...
Cool
Like do you know where is optimal for each perspective?
But like specific locations.
So the 5 can get the farm and the 1 can protect them?
So are pos 1 and pos 5 grouped  together in a lane during that
Also how did you learn where to put wards?
Define laning
How do you balance keeping people off your pos 1 heroes without feeding the other team?
Are there different phases to the game?
Besides just late and early
Like how do you know when you are suppose to farm, push or team fight when no one is telling you what to do?
Why
I'm also curious as to how team fights work. 
Jesus
But like how do you and mac know the role of every hero?
Or like their roles in the meta?
Is there somewhere online that has the tiers of characters?
What does that mean
And how do you decide these strategies
So how do teams strategize when you just play online?
Weird
You can see other players inventory?
I'm curious as to how everyone knows what inventory everyone has at all times. 
Or is that like asking what's more important knights or bishops?
What's more important items or level?
How much average of each pos
What is the General make up of a team?
And pos 1 heroes are better late game and vice versa?
And farm is creeps and jungle and kills?
"Though I get ward bitch"
Is there a site that explains those?
But like there are silencers right?
What are the names of the strategic make up of the teams?
I know there is offense, defense and support.
But is it more thorough than that in the meta?
Ah
That dancing witch doctor is too much
I thought drow wasn't allowed in competitive. 
I'm there too
Yeah
Good
!!!
I was at subway
Did eg win?
Lol
Yeah
And have giant dicks
Both have hooks
Both have an aoe that causes disease
No they are literally the same
I'm gonna only play pudge to cross train for highwayswine
I don't want time to fly.
So it's either exercise or a new video game. 
But now that I'm not with Megan I need something to fill that time. 
Especially when I'm so behind on comics
I just don't want to learn something new
God dammit
I sort of want to...
Lol
This makes me want to play dota...
Lol
Lol
I don't understand a thing
After 18 for me but yeah
I've been on a rollover plan forever and now I have over 20 gbs

ground

Lol
No dumber than a pig

Smarter than normal dogs
Like a slightly intelligent dog. 
Too late.
I'm already playing it

Because I just blew 60 on a bunch of n64 ganes
And probably never buy it
I'm just going to play it at the store
Good thing I'm not buying. 

mac you wanna go to the next ti with me?
i wonder if they bought that guy new frys
i cant wait until disney buys valve
ugh
"miricle pregnant me"
besides valve
whos the largest paid sponser of this
dota 2
but dota
i know
but like only a public real game
i like how this game is only like 4 years old
and the token asian
white people
lol
Mac, if there was a girl in one of your labs that you found out was really into Dota what would you do?
im 50 comics behind...
hes the most frugal multimillionare there is
those flip flops probably cost 3 dollars
I probably wont watch it, but i will have it playing so it generates intrigue
lol
ill make a post on facebook incase anyone is into that shit
coo
is it just on twitch or what?
k
like how long will they go for
i meant today
how long does it last?
well ill play it
coo
should i play it at work?
and have a higher win rate than him
i play more quickpla
because he plays while we sleep
it makes sense hes that high
yeah but i meant his level
im 28
hes at 20 hours
he was looking at his account last night
no
almost as much as me now
hes put a lot of hours into it
eh
because apparently a lot of people were abadoning so they kept the xp you get from completing game closer
it gives you pretty much the same as you got when you lost
lot
its not a lote
less
in an update this morning
they changed how much xp lucioball gives you to
yeh we need the xp
get a ps4
I own rocket league mac
wrecked their team 5-0
Some guy i was playing with saw me go in goal even when i didn't start out there and was like "hey kid, if you are planning on winning stay where you start"
that was for ronald
bitch
sounds like something a deaf person would say
hkfhjkfhjl
masturbate
I "gotta do shit too"
way ahead of you
judging by the last time i remember using the stuff in the lunchbox
it must have been sometime between january and march
the money or the headphones
still havent found my headphones though...
and eventually forgot about it
because i realized i had a shit ton of money in my wallet so instead of depositing it and then spending it I put it in my starwars lunchbox
I just found a shit ton of money I hid from myself look for my headphones
classic crimson chin
sounds about right
I bet he couldn't see for shit
did you mug the guy in red?
you tired?
Tired?
lol

k
lol
k
what a dummy
does he even java?
what a loser
who even is ron?
RON let me know when you wanna wreck some noobs
but i have yet to have a game where all three people on my team had the same skin
well to be honest since you are focused on the ball no the characters you dont really pay attention to their skins that much
you are being a hater of something you will love
mac
thats like asking me to explain love
mac
Ronald and i are going to drop out of school and play professional lucioball
what matters is lucioball
because all of that is stupid
but that doesnt matter
yes
http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/overwatch/images/9/9c/Tracer_Olympics_Skin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160803170425
they changed everything, including adding new skins for the olympics
because it is in tandem with the olympics
that is the weekly brawl
it is a way of life
just like rocket league
the map is very basic
they didnt really put a lot of work into it
maybe theyll keep it as a custom game
who knows
they made one
but with lucios instead of cars
it is rocket league
stop saying shit about things you dont understand
dude
youll understand when you play it
dude
it is a way of life
its so much more than that
dude
thats because you have been brainwashed by the government mac
and replace it with lucioball
they should just cancel the olympics
lol

there we go that should leave some room


let me help
oh were you trying to leave a gap so that way it wasnt on your screen?
hahahaaha
ahaha

Guess where i am
the white house?
using secret ISIS technology
He enhanced that highway sign on the left of your picture
Obama just had it installed last month
Probably
ah
AH
is this your first time in dc?
LOOKS LIKE A GIANT DICK
yup
im working on a comic right now about ian
let me see
oh you didnt say it was of my old boy george
no
i didnt realize you werent mac
lol
their smoothies also have a lot higher vitamin content
like naked
but there are a lot of drinks that do that
that part is true
because thats not someting we are really lacking in 2016
'
yeah but thats not really a plus
although his are a lot more expensive because hes crazy
my grandfather makes a giant vat of smoothies every sunday which he has every morning
you use this really special tecnique called a freezer
like you could just make a kale and banana smoothie for like 10 bucks and that would last you a week and would be way better for you
but costs 20 bucks
yeah which is about the same as soylent
my grandma even takes one
they have ones made just for nutrients
and what im trying to show is that this is one that is for bulking up
i does if you are a monster
yup
and marketed towards people who dont work out
but soylent is just a protein shake sold in a smaller serving size so that way its a more apporiate dietary supplement

soylent is about 20% of all the nutrients you need per daily value
im looking at mine right now
dude
yeah but have a shit ton higher nutritional value
not even close to true
...
yeah
this is just literally a protein shake smoothie
yeah
and you could make someting way cheaper yourself with a higher nutritional value
im looking at the nutrition info for this mac
im an idiot
nm
is 400kcal mean 400 thousand calories?
wait
i wish i could just order like 6 bottles
hmmm
with a slightly different texture
milk
just honey and mil
i like that taste
shoudl i get the bottles or the power?
this is fucking disgusting though
https://soylent-production-herokuapp-com.global.ssl.fastly.net/static/images/drink_gallery5.546e2142f4c6.jpg
I just have a problem finding time to prepare all the things i need to stay healthy
i really hope it is secretly made from people
I just bought it too
yup
so it is a clever pop culture reference
its also clearly marketed towards people our age
yeah
Its funny they named their product after that
but is made from people
its literally a condensed version of all the necessery nutrients
synopsis
you read the synopsius?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_Green
like what they named it after?
you know what that is a reference to right?
Lol
I'll take that as a yes
A dragon dildo?
i havent eaten since yesterday morning
ugh i wish i had bagels
whoa
and i cant figure out why
my chameleon is going fucking crazy
makes star wars look liek shit
agreed
too
Thats true
Yah
I mean from a branding standpoint, actually, yes.
if a franchise begins to diminish in returns, a studio just revitalizes it with a new producer
thats very true, which is why "rebooting" a franchise has become so mainstream
beucase once theybe already made the changes it is too late
you give them the money to make your house look nice, but you just have to trust their abilities
Its sort of like hiring an interior decorator for your home
and how that is funded and produced
and think about a movie like sharknado
but a better way of thinking about it is going smaller scale
thats the real shit show
and what really does studios like warner in is that they try to emulate marvel, before they actually succeede and force their creators into contractual agreements
especially now that hollywood is beginning to captialize off of the international markey
Well heres the thing, is that most of these movies that still suck, make a really good profit
inlcuding toys, clothes, and other merch
because they stidios own all rights to anything made of the movie
and also making a shit ton of merch money
the studio has no actually interest in the process of making movies, just profiting from them so they can fund more movies and repeat the process
but the studio essentially funds it and leaves it to the producer to do all the work, like hiring a director, casting company, etc
Thats the studio
and then the producer has the greatest ammount of creative control
and then they do
a producer is basically the owner of the movie, because he or she walks into the studio and says why they should make this movie
Thats not how it works
because they own it
you dont hire the owner, but yet they can make whatever dumb choices they want
its like owning a company
producers arent hired
because producers are actually dumb
apparently what everyone is saying about this movie is that it isn't bad, but all the reviews are still sore about batman v superman
?
Why would you hope it bombs
which defeats the poiint but whatever
but they realized they could make a shit ton of money if they had "midnight premieres" all day
no they used to do that
so im going to the 9 one tonight
no, most movies now have all day thursday showings
I'm trying to go into all movies now thinking it is bad
then i will be pleasantly suprised
as a family
together
but phil is coming with me so we will just make fun of it
no because i have no excuse
just not this one
i love the Suicide Squad
the tone or the characters don't interest me
because even if it is not bad, I have no interest in that movie
but i agreed like a month ago
im so pissed that i have to go
so guess who is seeing suicide squad tonight...
thats pretty much what his girlfriend calls him ironically
eh
Philip
he makes more than phil
Evan is super busy with gigs
thats not true
then she would slowly walk up to you and headshot your ass
youd just be walking to the kitchen and shed be there, and suddenly you wouldnt be able to move
theres less demand for everything music related
hahahaa
she is an axolotl
oh god
same thing philip does, but with a piano
she sounds boring
oh geez
times
yeah ive already watched that crash and burn 3 time
probably a lot
k
Or i could hire a prostitute and have sex outside their bedroom even louder
we could play video games real loud while they are having sexy times
i actually would enjoy that
k
she looks like a nice lady, which is good because Roger is a squishy baby deep down
unless thats his sister, which i doubt
dont know she is just on rogers facebook
I had to accept his friend request, which i had been putting off doing since march
I found her
Oh okay she's kinda cute
so his girlfriend is either an overwatch character or my axoltol?
NAME
see if she is attractive
I gotta check her out
...also what is her name
thats gonna be a big boy experience for you
OMG MAC
What is Css?
Roger seems like one of those guys
not to have sex with or anything, but so they can tell him about their feelings
I'm sure he has lots of ladies over
nice
NOT WORKING!
LOOK AT ALL OF US!
?
By yourself>
since i have today off
I decided im done working today
watch 2 minutes of that porn i sent you
where are you staying during school mac?
ah
I'm going to chicago for a few days right before classes start
lol
so pretty much up until school starts?
wait how long are you doing this?
Cleveland, Fucking, Ohio
the real captial of the governmnet
just definitly check it out when youve got the chance
k, no problem
mac did you watch the porn that i sent you?
Yup
and steal secret government thingies
I'm going to image enhance your photo like NCIS
I'm pretty sure you got that for christmas last year
especially the three monitors
That looks an awfully lot like your room mac
a subtle reminder that "hey that's some nice freedom of speech you have got there, it'd be a shame if someting happened to it..."
showing you they don't appreciate this
maybe it was the government
lol
duh
NO BLISS
they are always watching
you are always on Noblis wifi mac
(and the donuts aren't bombs, they are actual donuts, we just get a bit peckish while plotting the demise of western cutlure)
Hey bud its me, Abdul Alhazred, you were late to our last ISIS meeting, so next time youll have to bring the donuts.
FOR SOME REASON THEY HATE AMERICA
911 WAS CAUSED BY SENTIENT ORBS FROM THE 7TH DIMENSION
but thats probably not the only thing they have in common
thats a similarity
thats not a difference
whats the difference between noblis and isis?
I guess that would cost money though
cant you have it delivered to you from site?
(the gangs all here) - 'cept Asher
that was just an illusion that visitied you in NY
same with Asher
hes been home this whole time
macs just home
lol

it's crazy
seriously though you would watch the first minute of it
i only watch porn at work
yeah its pretty good
lol
...why?

HI
boy
for reeasons....
i have that bookmarked



Ronald you need to update your facebook status to "I had a father once"
I love my friends
i leave for like one hour
oh my god
o my god
all three of us should
of kate?
ha
what whole thing
no
and never meet the market demand
that we announce 5 years before we actually release them
and fleshlights
we can develop our own occulus rift
people like porn more than games
probably more
a "y"
except a why photoshoped on in comic sans
literally no differenty
We can call it "Steamy"
who else?
and we will not so secrely use the entire client to promote our own porn videos
you have to unlock acheivements to unlock special porn videos
have summer sales
exactly
that way you could get acheivements
steam but with free porn
What if we create a porn client
yeah you have to earn it
can't you tell by the play buttons
and videos
we should submit this to them as a suggestion for change
it is complete
YES!
The last one is defnintely my favorite
this is just like fan fiction
it'd be cyber bullying if we showed her
nah
Now it is too far


sigh, time to go on kate's facebook
we just need three different images
honestly not far enough
Don't doubt it
no gimmicks just dicks and tits
porn
talk about our mission statement to bring streamline ponr
We also need to redo the text
Well here it is anyway
ah
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/110114161098248192/194130945421344769/unknown.png
tab
I also like how you have the picture open in the other tag
YOu think she will understand?
Im posting that
thank god
HOLY SHIT
NO
YES
TOO FAR
I CANT
like tumblr but just of porn
fuck comments, fuck memberships, just straight up infinite scrolling of porn
YES
design the worlds best porn site
idea
Or take their diea
just statistically speaking
That is actually true
I mean thats what ruins most of my masturbation sessions is having to navigate through ugly ui's
instead of all those boring headers you could just have: asian, redhead, milf, etc
just think on the what we do section
you are not wrong
I mean
100m+ vistors a day
It is really sad that there are no porn sites designed as sleekly as their website though
in all seriousness
I mean i feel like managing a porn site would be high profile work
I believe in brand loyalty
yeah
and them dolphinfuckerz.net for the rest
and them pornhub 10% of the time
i am on xvideos 78% of the time
...
i mean
so it pops up bellow my address bar
I have it bookmarked
sigh *unzip*
http://www.xvideos.com/video18341733/porno_d_maincraft
oh sorry
I'm going to hell

Free publicity is good publicity
Do you think it is appropraite to post this on facebook?

Hold on mac let me help you

oh hi
Catwoman not making this list is a shocker.
I would think historically she would be the #2 vagina in the DC universe (behind WW obviously) and remembered on-screen for different generations whether the Adam West BATMAN series or Michelle Pfeiffer or Anne Hathaway's versions.
Honestly I'm surprised Starfire didn't make this list all things considered.
