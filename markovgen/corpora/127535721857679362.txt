127535721857679362 (2017-10-31T14:38:26.707000+00:00) : My control group for the replicate? I guess that could work but it would take some time to get used to
127535721857679362 (2017-10-31T14:36:24.181000+00:00) : My keybindings only support 5 abilities
127535721857679362 (2017-10-31T14:36:13.619000+00:00) : Also the 6 keys are going to be a problem
127535721857679362 (2017-10-31T14:36:00.337000+00:00) : I'm slowly warming up to the new morphing I just don't like how it removed his split pushing ability
127535721857679362 (2017-10-31T14:27:35.904000+00:00) : How does that work
127535721857679362 (2017-10-31T00:43:06.804000+00:00) : Isn't it a channeled stun?

127535721857679362 (2017-10-30T23:43:29.804000+00:00) : I feel like I would make a mistake with morphing
127535721857679362 (2017-10-30T23:42:56.229000+00:00) : And fully safe shotguns

127535721857679362 (2017-10-30T23:41:32.594000+00:00) : If I morph and get damaged, then morph back do I still have the damage or am I at the health I was previously? Also does this work with ults?
127535721857679362 (2017-10-30T23:33:51.863000+00:00) : Isn't that only useful if I'm weaker than the enemy
127535721857679362 (2017-10-30T22:55:02.954000+00:00) : Replicate was op in that nobody knew what it did before

127535721857679362 (2017-10-17T01:35:45.533000+00:00) : but typically with software companies you can't negotiate the base but you can negotiate the signing
127535721857679362 (2017-10-17T01:35:28.885000+00:00) : depends on the company
127535721857679362 (2017-10-17T01:34:57.124000+00:00) : it's a free trip to san francisco basically

127535721857679362 (2017-10-17T01:31:45.325000+00:00) : depending on the industry it might
127535721857679362 (2017-10-17T01:31:21.583000+00:00) : the company will blacklist you
127535721857679362 (2017-10-17T01:31:14.428000+00:00) : you shouldn't
127535721857679362 (2017-10-17T01:31:07.801000+00:00) : yeah

127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:20:10.430000+00:00) : Keenan are you planning on making an opening for Macs bridge?
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:15:10.083000+00:00) : Not for Macs secret farm but in general
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:14:42.036000+00:00) : I really want to play now
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:10:37.155000+00:00) : Other than hoarding resources
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:10:24.898000+00:00) : Mac you still haven't said what you've built
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:07:26.018000+00:00) : What's that
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:06:24.477000+00:00) : Pubg?
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:05:03.571000+00:00) : Every time
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:04:59.206000+00:00) : Smaller
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:04:57.250000+00:00) : It
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:04:55.623000+00:00) : Make
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:04:53.553000+00:00) : We
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:04:49.016000+00:00) : Instead of e,panding
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:04:44.448000+00:00) : What if
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:04:23.935000+00:00) : But I think we should have civcraft stores where you can buy a diamond for 10 stacks of wood or something
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:03:44.404000+00:00) : I also wouldn't be opposed to expanding just once
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:01:37.296000+00:00) : So it'd still force us to work for stuff
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:01:25.704000+00:00) : I honestly don't think we should expand until it's fully saturated, we can just create stores for buying resources with renewable ones
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:00:55.894000+00:00) : I also like how were confined to the cube it makes space really valuable
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:00:29.430000+00:00) : Mac I haven't seen anything you've built
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T20:00:17.246000+00:00) : That's kind of what I want to do with the mountain but not as wide and not for a jungle
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T19:59:39.601000+00:00) : Did Keenan hollow out his tower?
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T19:58:44.871000+00:00) : Yeah but it's done better with the overhang
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T19:58:29.401000+00:00) : My next step is taking out everything within the walls
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T19:58:05.584000+00:00) : With the supports and stuff, I had planned to do that ever since I started building the walls
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T19:57:44.784000+00:00) : Mac do you like what I did with the overhang?
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T18:36:11.165000+00:00) : I just assume she's always pissed at me
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T18:11:59.512000+00:00) : Megan might not like what I've done. I basically built an overhang over her area
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T18:08:58.340000+00:00) : I played a lot last night
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T18:08:47.253000+00:00) : That's why I haven't done anything with the Google instance lately
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T18:08:24.885000+00:00) : There's also an intern hackathon/venture pitch competition going on right now that's taking up a lot of my free time
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T16:58:29.542000+00:00) : I took the wings inside the chest by Keenan tower at spawn. I'm assuming those were left for me
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T16:57:22.055000+00:00) : Also want to include rendering from 2 angles
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T16:57:07.027000+00:00) : I'll fix it tonight, there's a lot of changes that I want to see
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T16:56:46.699000+00:00) : The map is down for some reason
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T08:07:36.108000+00:00) : keenan your jungle room is really nice
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T03:23:03.155000+00:00) : Last backup was 1-2 days ago

127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T02:41:11.119000+00:00) : Okay can someone help me test which level.dat I need to use

127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T02:38:20.009000+00:00) : Mac do you know what level.dat does?
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T02:38:06.282000+00:00) : Let me finish the backup and render and then I'll try to get the items back
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T02:27:48.167000+00:00) : Are you guys playing on it now or should I shut down the server and run a render
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T02:27:26.442000+00:00) : The map isn't working for some reason

127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T02:25:45.130000+00:00) : Last thing logged was Asher joining
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T02:25:10.082000+00:00) : There's no crash report or anything in the logs
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T02:24:59.852000+00:00) : That's really weird that the server crashed
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T02:22:50.586000+00:00) : The node server seems to be down thoguh
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T02:22:37.215000+00:00) : It's been up since like the second day
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T02:22:29.741000+00:00) : Lol Keenan
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T02:21:40.094000+00:00) : Also there's technically a url if you go to should start up the Minecraft server
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T02:21:14.215000+00:00) : But Mac should easily be able to restart it
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T02:20:44.033000+00:00) : Okay working on it now
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T01:41:04.666000+00:00) : He bullied me into giving him ssh access
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T01:40:49.021000+00:00) : Also Mac can fix this too
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T01:40:42.828000+00:00) : I just got back from work
127535721857679362 (2017-07-18T01:03:45.282000+00:00) : Why does it say you're playing unity
127535721857679362 (2017-07-16T22:48:07.159000+00:00) : Oh I was wondering how a wild one got in

127535721857679362 (2017-07-16T02:36:52.970000+00:00) : SERIOUSLY WTF
127535721857679362 (2017-07-16T00:58:27.138000+00:00) : Backups are saved and the new render is online
127535721857679362 (2017-07-16T00:58:15.881000+00:00) : Also servers back up
127535721857679362 (2017-07-16T00:58:05.432000+00:00) : I'm pretty sure Megan plays more than any of us
127535721857679362 (2017-07-16T00:57:53.875000+00:00) : Mac that sounds like a terrible idea
127535721857679362 (2017-07-16T00:54:48.962000+00:00) : Oh she logged on in the 5 minute span between when I checked and when I took it down
127535721857679362 (2017-07-16T00:50:40.126000+00:00) : Was she on the Server? I checked to see if anyone was on it before taking it down
127535721857679362 (2017-07-16T00:48:23.543000+00:00) : Render is going faster than before
127535721857679362 (2017-07-16T00:48:01.014000+00:00) : 15
127535721857679362 (2017-07-16T00:47:58.583000+00:00) : Probably not long maybe another 10 or 1t mins
127535721857679362 (2017-07-16T00:46:56.994000+00:00) : I'm running the render now
127535721857679362 (2017-07-16T00:46:51.833000+00:00) : I ran a manual backup which already completed
127535721857679362 (2017-07-16T00:36:07.835000+00:00) : Also Mac the texts no longer work because I changed the way the server was running so they write logs somewhere else
127535721857679362 (2017-07-16T00:34:57.577000+00:00) : Server going down for maintenance and shit

127535721857679362 (2017-07-08T00:32:37.699000+00:00) : Lol, she knows that's not my number right?
127535721857679362 (2017-07-08T00:30:24.985000+00:00) : Or did she think it was just some random unrelated text

127535721857679362 (2017-07-06T05:09:55.111000+00:00) : because eta is 9 hours
127535721857679362 (2017-07-06T05:09:50.405000+00:00) : is it supposed to take a long time the first time?
127535721857679362 (2017-07-06T04:20:57.079000+00:00) : discord's api is kind of hard to handle though
127535721857679362 (2017-07-06T04:20:10.232000+00:00) : to be honeste, i started a github repository for this project
127535721857679362 (2017-07-06T04:19:31.204000+00:00) : or do you mean a custom console
127535721857679362 (2017-07-06T04:19:14.256000+00:00) : thagt would be kind of hard
127535721857679362 (2017-07-06T04:18:29.969000+00:00) : like full on console?
127535721857679362 (2017-07-06T04:17:56.090000+00:00) : right now there's a delay
127535721857679362 (2017-07-06T04:17:51.976000+00:00) : i think down the line, i want to run the minecraft jar through node so node has instaneous detection of output
127535721857679362 (2017-07-06T04:17:11.077000+00:00) : what's more interesting is i can also stuff commands

127535721857679362 (2017-07-06T04:15:52.738000+00:00) : it opens up a lot more possiblities

127535721857679362 (2017-07-06T03:14:13.053000+00:00) : <@!240129712645603329> Can you also give me your number

127535721857679362 (2017-07-06T03:06:01.144000+00:00) : asher i ca n't believe you built another cube
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T20:54:05.386000+00:00) : You said kinsman sucks
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T20:53:59.421000+00:00) : Where's my apology
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T20:05:40.934000+00:00) : It's a little delayed but it works. My node server is watch that file and gets the last line from it every time it updates
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:58:54.989000+00:00) : If is, I can use socket.io to serve it
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:58:37.100000+00:00) : Do you think the server log should be live?
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:57:16.776000+00:00) : Yeah, I can Do that or I can do some kind of wait function
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:57:01.662000+00:00) : Because there's already a cactuspue
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:56:47.734000+00:00) : Since its sending the commands to the screen it's async, then when the next command tries to create another screen named cactuspie, it fails
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:55:39.203000+00:00) : The restart is one script
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:55:17.254000+00:00) : I know but I think it might be firing the next bash command before the server stops so the next one is getting ignored
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:54:41.234000+00:00) : Yeah it is, I'll probably add some password protection to the front end
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:54:26.360000+00:00) : It might be a async issue
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:54:18.452000+00:00) : When the screen stuff /stop line is run, the next line doesn't run for some reason
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:53:48.470000+00:00) : I also have to fix the restart scripg
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:53:41.853000+00:00) : After this,I'm goiing to start building a website for the server with logs and a control for starting and stopping the server
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:52:59.366000+00:00) : Yeah, that might be better
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:51:49.241000+00:00) : I'm using code from another project that already has twilio set up and configuted
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:51:22.939000+00:00) : And then add a switch for each username
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:51:09.982000+00:00) : I'm running a node server that can already detect each time something is logged, I just need to write an algorithm that matches the log messages to the set of death messages
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:50:01.059000+00:00) : I almost have the death texts set up
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:49:24.919000+00:00) : It's super hard to copy in the terminal so seed is there
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:49:09.975000+00:00) : 
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:45:44.760000+00:00) : I'll try to do it in a bit but it's hard when I'm at work
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:02:28.319000+00:00) : Like the map?
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T19:02:24.629000+00:00) : What does that mean
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T18:54:58.492000+00:00) : Wtf
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T17:30:59.273000+00:00) : Server info is in the pinned post
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T17:30:40.485000+00:00) : Cum ben
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T17:28:41.014000+00:00) : Yo it's a game
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T16:39:34.376000+00:00) : It's the first day and the confinement to 128 by 128 makes it harder
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T16:38:55.465000+00:00) : I haven't played either
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T06:24:43.116000+00:00) : hmm, my restart script isn't starting the server back up after shutting it donw
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T05:47:21.277000+00:00) : But yeah I'm probably going to try to implement the text message thing, I already have logic figured ojt
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T05:46:48.021000+00:00) : It's way too hard to do transactions
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T05:28:19.002000+00:00) : Twilio
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T02:55:20.989000+00:00) : i already figured out how to do death messages
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T02:54:56.276000+00:00) : so you can immediately see if someone is cheating
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T02:54:38.856000+00:00) : what if we created a new chat channel on discord where all of the logs are sent to live
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T02:11:22.063000+00:00) : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aeK4uYUkAiCTBCfiekfUK_Fc8Dx8YwYUlajyPBtXlIA/edit?usp=sharing
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T01:57:29.784000+00:00) : yeah i can hear you guys
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T01:57:11.644000+00:00) : i haven't used discord on this computer in a while
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T01:57:03.200000+00:00) : i don't think my mic is working
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T01:56:50.434000+00:00) : i can you guys
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T00:49:25.336000+00:00) : I'll fix it later
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T00:47:54.040000+00:00) : I think the proper way is to stop the instance
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T00:46:43.848000+00:00) : Why
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T00:46:25.553000+00:00) : I've been using ctrl c or sending the quit command to the screen
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T00:46:05.101000+00:00) : No, should I be using stop
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T00:45:17.496000+00:00) : So if there's problems, anyone can restart the server
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T00:44:59.427000+00:00) : Depending on how much we actually play, I want to create a website ui that controls some of this stuff
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T00:44:21.170000+00:00) : It doesn't save them
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T00:43:54.346000+00:00) : I'm also going to start logging the console
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T00:43:39.202000+00:00) : You left :(
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T00:41:18.960000+00:00) : Also my restart script seems to work
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T00:40:49.271000+00:00) : I can ssh from my phone
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T00:40:33.099000+00:00) : 
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T00:37:19.894000+00:00) : I might have to restart the server
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T00:37:09.383000+00:00) : Sorry it won't let me
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T00:03:00.377000+00:00) : 
127535721857679362 (2017-07-05T00:02:58.077000+00:00) : i don't know if it worked
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:59:37.705000+00:00) : what do you mean by op
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:59:15.332000+00:00) : i have to go very soon
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:58:45.582000+00:00) : do i need to give you command blocks
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:58:19.730000+00:00) : alright, i should be done
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:58:07.569000+00:00) : you can delete a branch locally without it affecting the remote branch
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:57:39.485000+00:00) : i'm sure it can't be unlimited
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:57:32.507000+00:00) : i don't know
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:56:22.599000+00:00) : I can push it to a git repo
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:56:13.254000+00:00) : Lol you know what I can do instead of tar and saving it to a different folder?
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:55:14.241000+00:00) : or should i space them out
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:55:11.550000+00:00) : is it bad to run the world backup and the restart at the same time?
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:51:38.120000+00:00) : mac do you know what the cron tab line for every day at 5 am would be?
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:46:17.016000+00:00) : i can also spin up a storage instance iwth low computing power just to store the backups on
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:43:55.296000+00:00) : eventually this is going to cause storage problems but i'll write something else later to sort that out
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:43:40.853000+00:00) : then moving it to the backups folder
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:43:26.723000+00:00) : i'm naming the files based on timestamp
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:42:59.649000+00:00) : okay i think i have backups working every 12 hours
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:41:01.716000+00:00) : i've never really used cron before
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T23:40:52.148000+00:00) : i don't have to run those in screens right?

127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T20:58:41.410000+00:00) : That also sounds hard as fuck to create
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T20:58:27.663000+00:00) : That doesn't sound like vanilla
127535721857679362 (2017-07-04T20:53:48.419000+00:00) : Keenan would you play on a vanilla server

127535721857679362 (2017-07-03T23:07:08.702000+00:00) : I could also see a team making roster changes late into the season in order to better then chances of qualifying rather than for improvement of their team
127535721857679362 (2017-07-03T23:05:14.396000+00:00) : 3 players from top teams could form their own team with 2 random people and qualify over a mid levelteam of 5 that's been playing together

127535721857679362 (2017-07-03T22:57:07.614000+00:00) : This also means that people from multiple teams could form a new team right before ti and get a direct invite

127535721857679362 (2017-07-03T05:45:48.294000+00:00) : Or it stopped feeling mysterious
127535721857679362 (2017-07-03T05:45:30.010000+00:00) : It stopped feeling like a challenge
127535721857679362 (2017-07-03T05:44:53.225000+00:00) : I felt like I was mostly just watering, planting, and building up capital in order to maximize my return on investments

127535721857679362 (2017-07-03T00:39:38.438000+00:00) : Is there anyway you can negotiate the price down to about 45 dollars per person?

127535721857679362 (2017-06-27T05:10:16.986000+00:00) : He said he's fine with whatever but I'm afraid it will secretly play into whether I get a return offer or not
127535721857679362 (2017-06-27T05:09:23.074000+00:00) : Actually I'm more worried that my manager will get pissed I'm missing so many days
127535721857679362 (2017-06-27T05:06:37.030000+00:00) : But then again I spent 330 on tickets to indiana

127535721857679362 (2017-06-27T05:05:53.283000+00:00) : My tickets would be 220 round trip

127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T21:29:25.421000+00:00) : Because if I'm going to be there Thursday, I would rather do stuff in the city Thursday and Friday and maybe just watch dota on saturday
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T21:26:03.412000+00:00) : If Keenan doesn't go, are you guys going to be doing dota stuff only

127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T21:07:41.680000+00:00) : Because if the games run late you'll have to miss the endimg

127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T15:55:24.938000+00:00) : I get antsy after like a week of not doing anything. Then I start feeling like shit for being unproductive
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T15:51:31.082000+00:00) : The sad thing is I'm probably never going to retire
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T15:49:36.088000+00:00) : It's more like it's my last chance to travel for an extended period without worrying about work
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T15:48:46.396000+00:00) : No for like a month. Then drive around in america

127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:35:59.566000+00:00) : So for me it's between a  lenovo yoga or a surface pro
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:35:40.675000+00:00) : I think hp is a joke
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:35:04.621000+00:00) : I don't know. Personally something about the Dell xps rubs me the wrong way
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:33:30.547000+00:00) : Can't he just change the batter
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:33:15.086000+00:00) : Oh
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:33:10.158000+00:00) : The new ones are much betteer
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:32:10.093000+00:00) : I think they're underrated
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:32:03.628000+00:00) : I also might get a Lenovo yoga
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:31:52.887000+00:00) : You don't need something super powerful for a laptop thoufh
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:31:02.338000+00:00) : Yeah that's my biggest problem with it
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:29:32.672000+00:00) : And brew is amazing too
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:28:53.542000+00:00) : The Linux apt-get package manager is a God send
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:28:06.538000+00:00) : I would use my pc to play games and use native software
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:27:33.986000+00:00) : If I got a MacBook, I would only code and entertainment stuff on it.
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:26:04.828000+00:00) : Can't you run Windows on Macs now
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:24:28.171000+00:00) : Don't you just use Google docs now
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:21:52.814000+00:00) : There's a lot of ways to get free was credit
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:20:27.769000+00:00) : Although there's also no point with cloud
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:19:23.260000+00:00) : If I don't get a Mac, I would definitely partition Linux
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:18:54.188000+00:00) : I just don't like the Mac ui
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:18:32.516000+00:00) : I don't even use my pc now
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:18:05.742000+00:00) : Yeah, I worked on a Mac for the last 3 weeks and it's so much easier than pc
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:17:40.297000+00:00) : I'm also pretty sure I'm going to switch to a mac
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:17:10.404000+00:00) : But I didn't want to get an iphone and have another one come out in a few months
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:16:50.365000+00:00) : Because the red one just came out
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:16:40.489000+00:00) : I also considered an iphone
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:15:40.898000+00:00) : They're the only company that can compete with Samsung on the premium level
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:15:14.755000+00:00) : They're not
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:15:03.121000+00:00) : And the s8
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:14:59.719000+00:00) : For me at the end it was between the s7, the pixel, and one plus 3t
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:14:12.602000+00:00) : But I don't know how you could use 8gb of memory on a phone
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:13:53.342000+00:00) : Like it's basically the same phone as the previous generation except for a better processor, a second camera, and more memory
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:13:09.358000+00:00) : Apparently the new one plus phone isn't very good
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:09:24.246000+00:00) : I wasn't sure at the time but I am now
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:09:04.218000+00:00) : Mac it was worth it
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:08:31.129000+00:00) : <:sadboy:230133848740986891>
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:06:18.319000+00:00) : Besides looking for the loch Ness monster
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:05:34.894000+00:00) : What are you doing in scotland
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T07:00:10.976000+00:00) : Why do you guys stay up so late now
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:45:56.882000+00:00) : Oh I've seen that. I just didn't know it was called x ray
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:44:12.752000+00:00) : What is that
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:43:59.260000+00:00) : I've gotten like 20-30 dollars off per night before
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:43:38.570000+00:00) : Make sure to haggle
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:42:08.482000+00:00) : I can also look for airbnbs if you want help
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:33:52.726000+00:00) : And then after the week, we ask for a refund
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:33:17.270000+00:00) : Guys we should pool our money and invest some real estate in seattle
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:29:58.111000+00:00) : Not in a 1 bed room
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:29:49.545000+00:00) : Lol Yeah, I almost got kicked out of a hotel by doing that
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:27:36.777000+00:00) : Orchestra style
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:27:32.512000+00:00) : You can also do a hotel split 4 ways
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:27:15.678000+00:00) : But often a bedroom with 1 bed will allow 3 people
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:26:57.748000+00:00) : You should put the number of people coming
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:26:42.999000+00:00) : I would do that if i get to pay a little less

127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:23:55.819000+00:00) : I need to check airline prices
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:23:14.766000+00:00) : That's the Jessica Jones guy right
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:17:49.185000+00:00) : Mac is your mom's friend single
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:16:42.374000+00:00) : Mac can you buy my ticket too or does it have to be the same flight
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:15:00.951000+00:00) : I'm definitely going if your mom is going

127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T06:00:16.258000+00:00) : I don't think I can bring myself to pay 100 bucks to watch dota
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T05:59:43.987000+00:00) : And just chilling with Keenan during the day and all of us during the night
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T05:59:30.516000+00:00) : I honestly would be okay with not going to dota
127535721857679362 (2017-06-26T05:57:09.797000+00:00) : I can only do the weekend but if you're all in town and heading out on Saturday, I can maybe do Wednesday to sunday

127535721857679362 (2017-06-25T06:28:49.087000+00:00) : Nothing straightens the spine like sleeping on a hard tile floor

127535721857679362 (2017-06-25T05:52:05.846000+00:00) : I've never played Batman before so I can't follow that comparison
127535721857679362 (2017-06-25T05:46:05.733000+00:00) : Dishonored is a little too much stealth for me
127535721857679362 (2017-06-25T05:45:12.484000+00:00) : Buy
127535721857679362 (2017-06-25T05:45:05.845000+00:00) : I might not it anyway since it's so cheap
127535721857679362 (2017-06-25T05:44:41.173000+00:00) : I don't think I would like mordor that much most just because I'm not a big lotr fan
127535721857679362 (2017-06-25T05:42:27.972000+00:00) : The game play looks similar
127535721857679362 (2017-06-25T05:42:04.080000+00:00) : It seems like bioshock
127535721857679362 (2017-06-25T05:30:20.516000+00:00) : I'm going watch reviews for wolfenstein and shadow of mordor
127535721857679362 (2017-06-25T05:29:52.739000+00:00) : I never finished dishonored but I will go back to it

127535721857679362 (2017-06-25T05:24:06.446000+00:00) : I would ask Mac how he likes Batman bit he's never finished it so I don't know i can trust his judgement
127535721857679362 (2017-06-25T05:23:41.533000+00:00) : I've never played Batman before

127535721857679362 (2017-06-25T00:13:26.712000+00:00) : Everyone gets 500 to start but most people aren't redeeming any
127535721857679362 (2017-06-25T00:12:48.264000+00:00) : I'm at a hackathon where Google donated 150,000
127535721857679362 (2017-06-24T23:58:32.859000+00:00) : I'm at an event where I can possibly get thousands of Google cloud credits
127535721857679362 (2017-06-24T23:58:13.374000+00:00) : Is it going to be a thing again?

127535721857679362 (2017-04-15T00:18:11.869000+00:00) : Is that the card that's known for being super powerful?

127535721857679362 (2017-04-14T22:52:56.020000+00:00) : Also, if the fan sound gets really loud everytime i play a video game, does that mean i should clean out the dust
127535721857679362 (2017-04-14T22:52:33.820000+00:00) : i think my cpu gets a lot hotter than that

127535721857679362 (2017-04-12T17:26:48.149000+00:00) : god i hate identity politics
127535721857679362 (2017-04-12T17:20:06.801000+00:00) : lol roger gets sassy in his comments
127535721857679362 (2017-04-12T17:18:41.349000+00:00) : i'm also 100% serious about debating roger, can you let him know

127535721857679362 (2017-04-12T17:16:19.205000+00:00) : because i know that's social suicide
127535721857679362 (2017-04-12T17:16:13.371000+00:00) : i wouldn't do it over facebook
127535721857679362 (2017-04-12T17:15:51.932000+00:00) : i'm pretty sure i'm more conservative than 95% of the people at IU
127535721857679362 (2017-04-12T17:14:52.349000+00:00) : i actually agree with roger on the free pseech thing
127535721857679362 (2017-04-12T17:14:39.980000+00:00) : that would actually be pretty interesting because i debate in the same way as roger except i know when it's not appropriate to debate
127535721857679362 (2017-04-12T17:14:13.160000+00:00) : yeah
127535721857679362 (2017-04-12T17:09:46.246000+00:00) : yeah, but he has to understand that not everyone is open to debating
127535721857679362 (2017-04-12T17:06:01.104000+00:00) : but he's a fucking idiot for poking a hornets nest
127535721857679362 (2017-04-12T17:05:45.546000+00:00) : i agree with mac's points on roger

127535721857679362 (2017-04-12T16:55:33.242000+00:00) : i thought it was a fine arts job
127535721857679362 (2017-04-12T16:54:40.307000+00:00) : i signed up to one of roger's painters
127535721857679362 (2017-04-12T16:54:17.411000+00:00) : where can i read this all this hot gossip from roger?
127535721857679362 (2017-04-12T02:24:45.661000+00:00) : Mac I'm coming

127535721857679362 (2017-04-07T02:18:43.862000+00:00) : why did sunsfan get kicked from team sunsfan
127535721857679362 (2017-04-07T00:56:44.586000+00:00) : i can't either, i have homework and have to get up at 7 tomorrow
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T19:41:36.752000+00:00) : <@!71716577669550080> when so I have to make a decision by?
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T06:45:50.716000+00:00) : did you already buy tickets? and how hard would it be to sell?
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T06:45:33.277000+00:00) : shit mac, i had to complete an assignment and didn't see this
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T03:13:06.118000+00:00) : i'm playing dota so i don't have to do work
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T03:10:54.713000+00:00) : oh that's not far
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T03:10:44.127000+00:00) : do you wanna play dotes
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T03:08:48.982000+00:00) : i guess if you 3 all had the same flight you could uber for pretty cheap
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T03:08:29.612000+00:00) : but is there one from the airport to hotel/dota venue
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T03:07:20.651000+00:00) : once we get there
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T03:07:17.656000+00:00) : would we need a car?
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T03:06:52.653000+00:00) : because the other places that i'm going to don't require as much time
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T03:06:38.782000+00:00) : i'm going to go to seattle at some point either way so i might as well use my paid time off for that
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T03:06:04.884000+00:00) : hmm, i can still probably take off thursday and friday and spend thursday, friday and saturday in seattle and then go back on sunday
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T03:04:18.418000+00:00) : actually, it's jsut 11 weeks from june 5th, so i can count it out
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T03:03:33.709000+00:00) : let me see if i can find an exact date for when the internship ends
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T03:03:21.797000+00:00) : that's probably true
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T02:48:30.895000+00:00) : This is also contingent on the fact that ge will pay for my flight from seattle to north carolina instead of from san francisco to north carolina
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T02:47:57.869000+00:00) : i need to double check my work end time again
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T02:47:27.392000+00:00) : oh, i thought the finals were saturday and sunday
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T02:36:58.835000+00:00) : How would asher and keenan get to seattle?
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T02:36:50.496000+00:00) : I think it would be better if you didn't get me tickets. If keenan is in seattle, we could just hang out and that would save us all money on housing
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T02:16:10.930000+00:00) : the other thing is, i can still go for the last 4 days to seattle and room with you guys, i would just go explore the city and do other stuff but we can still cut on rooming costs. Keenan and I could do other stuff
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T02:11:44.397000+00:00) : can i just watch outside
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T01:35:47.732000+00:00) : Mac when would we have to make this decision by?
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T01:34:09.733000+00:00) : and i can fly out from the seattle area airport
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T01:33:59.765000+00:00) : i plan on visiting seattle sometime over the summer anyways
127535721857679362 (2017-04-05T01:33:33.412000+00:00) : I might actually be able to go for the last 4 days. i'm working in the east bay and get 2 days off so i could potentially stop working by the 9th of wednesday. I can also do overtime earlier and get more time off
127535721857679362 (2017-04-04T21:41:19.880000+00:00) : i spent maybe 120 dollars for 6 nights living in airbnbs during spring break
127535721857679362 (2017-04-04T21:40:30.306000+00:00) : airbnb can get pretty cheap if you have multiple people
127535721857679362 (2017-04-04T21:40:19.803000+00:00) : i think aug 11th is my last day

127535721857679362 (2017-04-04T21:37:26.567000+00:00) : i don't think i can go for the whole week but at least 2 days of the week and the weekend
127535721857679362 (2017-04-04T21:36:54.252000+00:00) : yeah, but it's close to seattle
127535721857679362 (2017-04-04T21:19:41.704000+00:00) : mac if you go to ti you should come visit me

127535721857679362 (2017-03-02T16:12:37.327000+00:00) : I hate it when I force myself to get out of bed and go to class and then find out that the professor canceled it

127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T19:12:05.486000+00:00) : I can buy a ticket for the hobbit and sneak in

127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T03:25:56.682000+00:00) : Like 1 giant building or city with uniform architecture
127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T03:25:36.547000+00:00) : The other thing we could do is work on one project all together in creative
127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T03:25:17.201000+00:00) : What's harvest cradt?
127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T03:23:39.756000+00:00) : Is your modded minecraft server still happening
127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T03:10:37.924000+00:00) : I think it's pretty cool that its entirely in the console
127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T03:09:22.126000+00:00) : When I was complaining about stardew valley, I was thinking more about developing a game myself
127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T03:08:51.457000+00:00) : Like I don't even know if the game started or if it's still building the world
127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T03:08:32.319000+00:00) : Okay I have no idea what's going on
127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T03:03:29.107000+00:00) : 
127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T03:02:29.486000+00:00) : Idk df graphics don't look very modern
127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T01:28:00.583000+00:00) : That gives you more time to start up other opportunities to make more money
127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T01:27:26.709000+00:00) : I meant more on an official capacity like you actually manage employees to do stuff on a salary
127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T01:25:54.781000+00:00) : You can have babies?
127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T01:25:36.841000+00:00) : That's probably my biggest disappointment with the game. The dog doesn't do anything
127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T01:25:17.149000+00:00) : Like how the dog doesn't do anything
127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T01:25:00.256000+00:00) : Really? I thought the spouse didn't do anything
127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T01:24:45.340000+00:00) : It would also require a lot more planning ahead and resource management
127535721857679362 (2017-02-28T01:24:13.955000+00:00) : Mac you know what they should add to stardew valley? The ability to employ npcs to do certain tasks. It decreases profit margins and could potentially increase production times but it would allow much more scaling
127535721857679362 (2017-02-27T03:08:32.890000+00:00) : is this a virus

127535721857679362 (2017-02-23T23:34:22.213000+00:00) : it's supposed tobe overclocked though
127535721857679362 (2017-02-23T23:34:09.578000+00:00) : without overclocking
127535721857679362 (2017-02-23T23:34:03.311000+00:00) : it works great for any game on a 1080p moniter

127535721857679362 (2017-02-22T00:44:06.033000+00:00) : That being said, they charged me for 3 months of wsj that I didn't know about and would only refund the most recent month
127535721857679362 (2017-02-22T00:43:08.043000+00:00) : The last time I tried to return something, they just gave me a full refund and let me keep the item too
127535721857679362 (2017-02-22T00:41:53.462000+00:00) : I thought they paid for shipping too
127535721857679362 (2017-02-22T00:41:40.469000+00:00) : You just can't do it a lot

127535721857679362 (2017-02-16T20:29:04.864000+00:00) : Mac the reason I asked I'd because I'm doing a study on whether lenovo products have a price premium relative to other brands and how much greater the price premium for Apple and samsung are
127535721857679362 (2017-02-16T20:27:54.619000+00:00) : It's actually a good investment because they're going to get rare and appreciate in value

127535721857679362 (2016-12-15T21:22:03.742000+00:00) : The fact that you can see the windows icon should mean your hdd is fine

127535721857679362 (2016-12-13T00:48:21.206000+00:00) : That was pretty fun. We went on a massive winning streak
127535721857679362 (2016-12-13T00:48:06.362000+00:00) : This summer
127535721857679362 (2016-12-13T00:48:02.963000+00:00) : There's also too many gameplay changes
127535721857679362 (2016-12-13T00:46:10.239000+00:00) : It's too much
127535721857679362 (2016-12-13T00:43:56.003000+00:00) : Someone should make a custom game that's just regular dota. I would play that
127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T23:37:42.996000+00:00) : i've been more or less done with dota since the summer
127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T23:36:34.367000+00:00) : everyone's here
127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T23:28:53.968000+00:00) : I feel like we need a good understanding of dota before making a bot
127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T23:24:02.449000+00:00) : Mac dota is just got so much harder I don't think I will ever spend the time to understand it again
127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T23:23:22.041000+00:00) : I'll show you my music when I come

127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T23:20:09.894000+00:00) : Keenan didn't you want to make a game?
127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T23:20:01.058000+00:00) : We should work on some dev project
127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T23:14:43.592000+00:00) : Also when di you guys finish finals
127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T23:14:04.106000+00:00) : What do you have that takes up so much spacd
127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T23:10:50.172000+00:00) : Yeah I might just go for speakers. During black friday, there were really good ones going for 20-30 bucks
127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T22:59:26.225000+00:00) : I've been using prime music more and more
127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T22:58:15.994000+00:00) : But is it worth sacrificing some if that quality for some of the dots features
127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T22:52:48.494000+00:00) : So the Google home is more than I want to spend on speakers. So I'm going to look more at the dot or just go with Bluetooth speakers that go on discount
127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T22:49:26.816000+00:00) : lol
127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T22:45:25.349000+00:00) : keenan, i don't think you could handle my playlist
127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T22:45:07.932000+00:00) : yeah i think i would probably go witht he google home over the dot, i still have 20 something dollars of google credit that i wouldn't otherwise spend
127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T22:43:47.097000+00:00) : actually i might go for the google home instead since i use google  music more than prime music
127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T22:43:06.466000+00:00) : i need portable speakers and it seems to be more useful than just a regular speaker
127535721857679362 (2016-12-12T22:41:23.492000+00:00) : what do you guys think of the amazon echo dot? i think i'm going to get one
127535721857679362 (2016-12-11T23:59:04.914000+00:00) : have any of you guys seen black mirror?
127535721857679362 (2016-12-11T23:56:32.725000+00:00) : whatthe acutal fuck. monkey king can turn into a tree and move around
127535721857679362 (2016-12-11T22:01:05.088000+00:00) : i'm going to uninstall
127535721857679362 (2016-12-11T21:59:36.484000+00:00) : the whole talent thing completely changes how metas work

127535721857679362 (2016-11-23T05:36:07.333000+00:00) : I think it's because keys are becoming the onlys table currency because they're backed by real money. everything else has no intrinsic value. When new stuff comes out, the pool of items get larger and larger and as more aesthetically pleasing items come out, even rare aesthetic items from the past are no longer valued as much. this creates a snow ball effect in which people who keep their keys stored as buds lose faith in buds and try to sell them off and as more people try to sell them off, the value drops
127535721857679362 (2016-11-22T00:26:27.737000+00:00) : Do you guys want to play Ow sometime tonight

127535721857679362 (2016-11-03T14:31:59.857000+00:00) : Also given the fact that he made a Facebook profile for a fake person  with only himself as the friend, idk if he can actually find you even if he has your name and phone number

127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T20:13:45.084000+00:00) : but it's only for freshmen
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T20:13:38.983000+00:00) : i want to take the class on time
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T20:13:30.949000+00:00) : https://www.coursicle.com/unc/#attr=PH,WB
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T20:13:30.336000+00:00) : these are all my options
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T20:12:17.902000+00:00) : which one do you think will have more reading
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T20:11:38.327000+00:00) : it's called Jesus in Myth, Tradition, and History and focuses on the years 30-200 ad
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T20:09:25.434000+00:00) : and from looking through the pictures of the bible comic book
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T20:09:01.761000+00:00) : from the 10 pages of the first testament that i read
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T20:08:52.584000+00:00) : but i know jesus better
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T20:08:33.183000+00:00) : i need to get my world before 1700 and philosophy requirements out of the way in one class and there's not a lot of options that satisfy both
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T20:08:02.819000+00:00) : and i don't think i can handle greek philosohpy
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T20:07:50.492000+00:00) : it's either jesus or greek philosophy
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T19:59:55.747000+00:00) : i might be taking a class on jesus next year
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T19:40:00.889000+00:00) : It also serves the purpose of getting everyone's phone numbres so if you were at a convention or something, the people planning it could send alerts to everyone who signed in
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T19:39:11.956000+00:00) : company recruiting events was where i got the idea from. recruitors keep track of who attends their recruiting events to see who "expressed the most interest"
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T19:38:17.568000+00:00) : there's ways to get around it but with traditional methods, people can always write other people in
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T19:37:43.732000+00:00) : only people there will know the event code
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T19:36:57.284000+00:00) : if you were planning an event and wanted to know who came to it and how many people, you can use it to check everyone in all at once rather than passing around a sign up sheet
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T19:35:38.693000+00:00) : it's for checking into events
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T19:34:41.376000+00:00) : has mac shown you our new site
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T19:28:26.467000+00:00) : but i think that might be illegal
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T19:24:44.402000+00:00) : if youjust block his number, he probably can't do anything
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T19:24:18.843000+00:00) : are you going to say anything to him?
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T19:19:25.060000+00:00) : i feel like his text message kind of gave it away
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T19:18:21.984000+00:00) : i was going to say you're in possession of stolen property but not anymore

127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T19:00:26.819000+00:00) : that's the most fail proof way of verifying a check because they will chekc hte balance of the payee for you to make sure it won't bounce
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T18:59:49.701000+00:00) : you can go to the bank account where the check is from to verify if it's legit

127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T18:53:31.685000+00:00) : that way, once the check bounces, you lose the money you got but the new account still has the money you trnasferred
127535721857679362 (2016-11-02T18:53:10.067000+00:00) : what he could be doing is asking you to transfer your money to the other account before the check bounces

127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T18:12:23.405000+00:00) : the main reason i've heard about ps4 over xbox is that with the xbox you have to keep on paying after you buy it
127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T18:11:43.649000+00:00) : they should make xbox live free
127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T18:10:15.457000+00:00) : it will cut into steam's monopoly on pc gaming

127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T18:08:50.801000+00:00) : like if you own it on xbox, you can put the disc into a pc and play it there too
127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T18:08:37.606000+00:00) : what i think microsoft could do is make games compatible between the xbox and pc
127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T18:08:15.989000+00:00) : most developers don't want to create games exclusive for one device
127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T18:07:50.879000+00:00) : the wii u was a financial distaster?
127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T18:07:09.749000+00:00) : there's never going to be a truely exclusive xbox game because it will always go to windows
127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T18:06:28.565000+00:00) : i think exclusive titles is nintendo's bread and butter

127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T18:01:07.442000+00:00) : now people are only going to get a wii since ninendo games won't be available for ps4 or xbox
127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T18:00:52.298000+00:00) : i feel like most people have a wii and then a ps4 or xbox
127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T18:00:15.339000+00:00) : i bet sony and microsoft are pissed

127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T17:58:44.684000+00:00) : why didn't ninetendo do this before with the wii
127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T17:58:22.486000+00:00) : so new games will be made specifically for it?
127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T17:58:05.338000+00:00) : ah okay
127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T17:57:06.415000+00:00) : i'm just trying to figure out if a company has to specifically create a ninento version or if you can just download it to your ninento switch and run a pc version

127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T17:55:57.061000+00:00) : because bethesda specifically built a version for ps4 that they put on the ps4 store
127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T17:55:17.984000+00:00) : how does it run skyrim, does it have a windows os or is bethesda altering the game just for the device
127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T17:54:29.142000+00:00) : so it's basically a tablet with a really good graphics card

127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T17:48:57.033000+00:00) : is it just a portable computer?
127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T17:47:52.449000+00:00) : that runs skyrim and overwatch?
127535721857679362 (2016-10-20T17:47:21.465000+00:00) : what did nintendo announce

127535721857679362 (2016-10-06T04:53:55.369000+00:00) : Eh I think it would be easier to sneak it to him than to get his conssnt
127535721857679362 (2016-10-06T04:52:20.223000+00:00) : I could technically force him but that would be really mean
127535721857679362 (2016-10-06T04:52:07.343000+00:00) : I don't think I can even convince him to go

127535721857679362 (2016-09-29T01:15:39.156000+00:00) : not if one of us dies first
127535721857679362 (2016-09-29T01:15:17.623000+00:00) : there's some parts where it uses really simple language to explain to the readers. also i expcted the overall vocabulary to be much more difficult since you said it's much more technical than the movie
127535721857679362 (2016-09-29T01:14:25.024000+00:00) : jesus christ that's like longer than i've been alive
127535721857679362 (2016-09-29T01:13:49.934000+00:00) : Also i don't like how it keeps simplifying things down
127535721857679362 (2016-09-29T01:13:31.307000+00:00) : Keenan
127535721857679362 (2016-09-29T01:13:25.366000+00:00) : so much more than in the movie
127535721857679362 (2016-09-29T01:13:17.268000+00:00) : mark watney is really sarcastic
127535721857679362 (2016-09-29T01:09:21.456000+00:00) : Also the drm removal tool I used is a trial version. Full version is only like 15 bucks so I might buy it or try to figure out how it keeps track of my computer and maybe do a workaround so I can use beyond the 30 days
127535721857679362 (2016-09-29T01:06:36.267000+00:00) : I'm not positive it works but since I can remove the drm and copy and paste the files it should
127535721857679362 (2016-09-29T01:05:56.262000+00:00) : But yeah, you basically need Adobe digital editions, a software called calibre, and a third party sketchy drm removal tool which I can send you the link of
127535721857679362 (2016-09-29T01:05:11.249000+00:00) : I usually just close discord
127535721857679362 (2016-09-29T00:25:49.111000+00:00) : i don't like reading on a regular sreen though
127535721857679362 (2016-09-29T00:20:13.738000+00:00) : and it's not a shitty pdf version either, since i removed the drm, i can convert them into kindle book format so it reads just like a kindle version
127535721857679362 (2016-09-29T00:11:52.203000+00:00) : i used to do this with music cds too

127535721857679362 (2016-09-28T23:56:41.704000+00:00) : i'm actually trying to see if i can use the same process on ebooks i download from a library website
127535721857679362 (2016-09-28T23:56:23.445000+00:00) : i had google credit that could only be used on books that expires in two days
127535721857679362 (2016-09-28T23:52:59.354000+00:00) : it took some software to convert it from the google book drm version to a kindle readable one
127535721857679362 (2016-09-28T23:52:12.505000+00:00) : mac i bought the martian

127535721857679362 (2016-09-27T19:34:49.499000+00:00) : it doesn't completely trnaslate to 100 level classes though because then we only have 100 - 200 level classes

127535721857679362 (2016-09-25T18:14:28.596000+00:00) : if it's hacked, i think they have bigger problems than protecting the catalog website
127535721857679362 (2016-09-25T00:47:29.343000+00:00) : Like that one time I told mac that driving and  sitting in a car are two different things. Especially if mac only rides backseat

127535721857679362 (2016-09-24T19:49:12.757000+00:00) : /r/the_donald is my favorite subreddit
127535721857679362 (2016-09-24T18:11:48.554000+00:00) : Mac driving and sitting in a car are two different things. Especially if you only ride backseat

127535721857679362 (2016-09-24T18:07:53.578000+00:00) : Mac driving and sitting in a car are two different things. Especially if you only ride backseat
127535721857679362 (2016-09-24T18:07:15.170000+00:00) : omg what have you guys done
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:21:21.270000+00:00) : Mac driving and sitting in a car are two different things. Especially if you only ride backseat
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:15:44.697000+00:00) : so i'm technically one of the two factors ont he sidewalk
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:15:38.302000+00:00) : i also walk on sidewalks mac
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:15:03.238000+00:00) : asher you dont' drive that much either. keenan is really the only person who can speak on both sides
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:13:49.821000+00:00) : well, if you're going to claim that then there's no point in discussing this any further
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:13:08.034000+00:00) : mac your rhetoric is flawed
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:12:59.066000+00:00) : if you say i can't make the counter assumption
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:12:51.179000+00:00) : how can you make that assumptionw hen you don't drive alongside bikes that much
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:12:05.930000+00:00) : so you're saying i can't say anythign about biking on the road because I don't bike on the road that often but you can speak with authority about driving along side bikes even though you don't drive that much
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:11:21.491000+00:00) : yeah but mac has driven like 2 in his entire life
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:11:14.378000+00:00) : then you can't say that about me not biking
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:10:16.627000+00:00) : mac you can't make say that i don't udnerstand because i've never ridden a bike, you've driven cars as much as i have ridden bikes
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:09:10.911000+00:00) : also generally people trying to drive think your an asshole if you go on the road
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:08:50.576000+00:00) : especially if the road is curvy
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:08:46.399000+00:00) : it's still easier and safer for a bike to pass or ask pedestrians to make space than for a car to pass a bike on a one lane road
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:07:41.871000+00:00) : people on bikes can pass people on sidewalks by going on the grass
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:06:26.799000+00:00) : if you run someone over with a bike, the most that will happen is a few stitches, if you get hit by a car, then you can die
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:05:45.409000+00:00) : idk abourt you guys, but people here bike on the sidewalks on the quad dand stuff
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:05:03.395000+00:00) : i feel like in smaller cities, there more cars on the road then people on side walks
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:04:37.510000+00:00) : but cards drive on the road
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:03:28.286000+00:00) : What's the reasoning for them to not use the side walk now
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T20:02:56.932000+00:00) : I think that bikers should be able to bike on the road if the speed limit is 25 or lower. If it's greater than 25, then they should use the sidewalk
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:59:05.519000+00:00) : Especially if the biker is in the middle of the lane, not close to the curb
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:58:47.367000+00:00) : Yeah my problem is when there's only one lane and it's not legal or safe to pass
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:52:47.767000+00:00) : I don't mind bike lanes but I do mind bikers going way below the speed limit especially on 2 lane roads whwre it's dangerous to pass them
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:52:15.131000+00:00) : What do you think then keenan?
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:50:14.658000+00:00) : Because its not legal to run the red light directly
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:50:00.448000+00:00) : It's not. Jaywalking pedestrians are asshole too
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:49:43.600000+00:00) : And then I have to pass them again
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:49:35.171000+00:00) : So while I'm sitting at the red light, they technically ran the red light
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:49:14.479000+00:00) : Mac if there's a bike at a red light, a lot of people pull over to the sidewalk and become a "pedestrian" and cross if there's no cars
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:46:42.957000+00:00) : You can cross aa long as there's no cara. Not everyone waits until it's red to cross
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:45:50.362000+00:00) : The light turns green for me and I catch up with them
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:45:37.827000+00:00) : Then I have to pass the biker again once
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:43:53.418000+00:00) : If there are no other cars around
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:42:47.236000+00:00) : That leads to me having to pass the same biker 2 or 3 times
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:42:21.172000+00:00) : Not to mentiom a lot of bikers don't follow traffic regulations and get on and off the sidewalks to bypass red lights
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:41:10.992000+00:00) : 90 percent of the time bikers who use an actual lane interferes with traffic
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:20:49.592000+00:00) : Also roads are meant for cars
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:18:43.013000+00:00) : They don't accelerate as fast
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:15:39.884000+00:00) : Because bikers are annoying
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T19:09:12.930000+00:00) : He said he personally doesn't get espoets and doesn't see a good way to compete with twitch
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T17:44:05.189000+00:00) : Apparently he went to several lol tournaments to learn more. Maybe dota too
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T17:41:58.356000+00:00) : I just attended a thing where the keynote speaker was the espn president and he spoke about espoets and what the current plan for espn to approach espoets is
127535721857679362 (2016-09-23T01:21:34.105000+00:00) : can't today
127535721857679362 (2016-09-22T21:32:06.340000+00:00) : The emotes look so different on mobile
127535721857679362 (2016-09-22T21:31:53.354000+00:00) :

127535721857679362 (2016-09-22T20:28:06.482000+00:00) : 😋
127535721857679362 (2016-09-22T14:57:59.342000+00:00) : But that's overkill
127535721857679362 (2016-09-22T14:57:03.209000+00:00) : I think ideally you would want a machine learning algorithm to determine popularity
127535721857679362 (2016-09-22T14:56:24.125000+00:00) : It's not a huge issue
127535721857679362 (2016-09-22T14:48:16.228000+00:00) : Ah
127535721857679362 (2016-09-22T14:44:54.663000+00:00) : Why?
127535721857679362 (2016-09-22T14:43:47.237000+00:00) : List
127535721857679362 (2016-09-22T14:43:45.167000+00:00) : Like I would understand if fallout new vegas was lower on the lust
127535721857679362 (2016-09-22T14:43:27.128000+00:00) : Mac that doesn't explain the term thing. Fallout 3 is much closer to fallout than anything else
127535721857679362 (2016-09-22T14:41:42.556000+00:00) : Fallout 3 is one term of difference whereas the dlc is mutple
127535721857679362 (2016-09-22T14:41:00.033000+00:00) : But fallout 3 is a closer match to fallout
127535721857679362 (2016-09-22T14:40:39.344000+00:00) : Why does fallout 3 broken steel and point lookout show up before just fallout 3
127535721857679362 (2016-09-22T14:39:40.616000+00:00) : Yeah but you wouldn't want the dlc to show up first
127535721857679362 (2016-09-22T03:23:29.184000+00:00) : when i search fallout the first game that pops up is fallout broken steel wtf mac
127535721857679362 (2016-09-22T02:02:12.878000+00:00) :

127535721857679362 (2016-09-21T20:27:05.131000+00:00) : that's pretty tight
127535721857679362 (2016-09-21T20:26:54.271000+00:00) : i just saw the pinned post: i miss the old ronald. the never joins call ronald. the just went offline ronald
probably because we're annoying ronald
127535721857679362 (2016-09-21T19:58:54.222000+00:00) : i'm pink mac, mac is purple mac and keenan is green mac

127535721857679362 (2016-09-21T03:14:24.477000+00:00) : they just mentioned a restaurant that bank of america took us to a couple times
127535721857679362 (2016-09-21T02:58:15.782000+00:00) : i'm kind of disappointed
127535721857679362 (2016-09-21T02:58:09.922000+00:00) : at the end of the pilot when he goes into the room of people in suits, i thought the chairman was going to be mr. robot as a plot twist
127535721857679362 (2016-09-21T02:55:16.780000+00:00) : isn't it about deleting debt?
127535721857679362 (2016-09-21T02:54:41.638000+00:00) : because the whole detached narrative thing and the catching criminals and keeping trophies of them is a lot like dexter

127535721857679362 (2016-09-19T06:05:49.876000+00:00) : i feel like that's also overkill
127535721857679362 (2016-09-19T06:05:37.889000+00:00) : like do a more basic search but set up an algorithm that stores what keywords people search and what results they actually click on to raise the relevance score
127535721857679362 (2016-09-19T06:04:00.208000+00:00) : did you consider doing some kind of machine learning search?
127535721857679362 (2016-09-19T06:00:47.828000+00:00) : oh i forgot you excluded terms

127535721857679362 (2016-09-19T05:58:38.519000+00:00) : what happens if they enter more than 6 terms then?
127535721857679362 (2016-09-19T05:57:57.356000+00:00) : how are terms determined? by spaces?
127535721857679362 (2016-09-19T05:56:27.395000+00:00) : is there a relevance score you deem to be too low then?
127535721857679362 (2016-09-19T05:55:47.813000+00:00) : and this is all client side javascript?

127535721857679362 (2016-09-07T16:53:58.574000+00:00) : does she have a ring

127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T23:32:03.302000+00:00) : i think you already have access to it
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T23:31:25.442000+00:00) : yo mac, i'm moving the campuscache files to the tclassified repository instead of the cholical.io one because i need the cholical.io one for something else
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T20:28:01.830000+00:00) : What convention
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T19:40:36.103000+00:00) : just thought you should know keenan
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T19:39:57.860000+00:00) : so instead of 400 pixels, you can say 5 cm
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T19:39:40.528000+00:00) : apparently you can assign css values with centimeters
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T03:53:02.777000+00:00) : did ron like what you made for them?
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T03:37:19.968000+00:00) : oh
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T03:36:59.460000+00:00) : cuz on mobile, it doesn't use nicknames, it just uses usernames
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T03:36:31.158000+00:00) : click on his name in the sidebar
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T03:35:57.787000+00:00) : wtf how did keenan change his username to cholical
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T03:14:00.636000+00:00) : otherwise it woudl just be box
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T03:13:57.257000+00:00) : see they put x in the name to add intrigue
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T03:04:51.936000+00:00) : what do you mean they turned him into modok
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T03:04:24.358000+00:00) : what's modok
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T03:02:41.263000+00:00) : why is there an s now
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T02:58:09.703000+00:00) : best if you stick with n8
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T02:55:44.693000+00:00) : what about the original person who answers it
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T02:55:02.473000+00:00) : what about the people who answer stack overflow posts
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T02:54:19.152000+00:00) : maybe you shoudl get good
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T02:53:45.142000+00:00) : i would price a website by an hourly estimate
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T02:53:19.981000+00:00) : it can be
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T02:52:46.996000+00:00) : charge a lumpsum rather than hourly
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T02:52:25.856000+00:00) : you gotta discuss that before youw ork
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T02:51:38.915000+00:00) : at least you get paid to do homework
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T02:51:12.381000+00:00) : mac are you really not getting paid for this?
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T02:49:05.230000+00:00) : it's to make keenan wonder what psx is
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T02:48:46.048000+00:00) : for a second there i thought you wre talking about me
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T02:48:31.439000+00:00) : because adding x to anything adds intrigue
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T02:48:06.353000+00:00) : you should never pro bono, that just means your a slave
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T02:47:29.074000+00:00) : mac are they paying you well
127535721857679362 (2016-09-06T02:43:25.879000+00:00) : i had to show stuff on my computer to a group of people, couldn't run the risk of them seeing cunt dracula
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T06:18:02.984000+00:00) : Although it's probably the aame speed if the number of items stay at 10k
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T06:15:01.514000+00:00) : You could do a server side search
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T06:03:22.379000+00:00) : Especially if you're doing a keyword search
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T06:03:08.109000+00:00) : No, not the load time, the search time
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T06:02:51.458000+00:00) : That fucked me during a presentation because there was dara that ie caches that chrome doesn't
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T06:02:23.400000+00:00) : Also internet explorer and chrome have different caching algorithms
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T06:01:50.789000+00:00) : Since the search is completely client side, people with sitter computers will have slower result times
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T06:00:21.526000+00:00) : That's because you have a fast com0uter
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:58:38.755000+00:00) : And then charge them extra because it'll be easier to use
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:58:18.896000+00:00) : You can probably also make a ui for it
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:54:03.660000+00:00) : Oh right. How does gameworld update the data?
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:52:51.086000+00:00) : It saves an http call
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:52:40.928000+00:00) : Why not just save the json in the angular javascript
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:48:57.457000+00:00) : is there a backend to this site
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:48:41.585000+00:00) : yeah that's what i was thinking
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:45:06.781000+00:00) : so you don't have the first paging matching just "the" when someone types "the legend of zelda"
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:44:41.609000+00:00) : are you going to do a keyword filter? because if you do, you'd have to have some kind of sort on relevance
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:41:10.092000+00:00) : also does it even matter that much in javascript since javascript uses virtual memory
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:40:41.079000+00:00) : what kind of sort are you going to use
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:40:19.786000+00:00) : it's only ugly cause it's uglified
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:35:49.780000+00:00) : why not just use javascript
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:35:07.421000+00:00) : you probably want to strip punctuation too
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:33:23.974000+00:00) : but there's less confusion
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:33:02.767000+00:00) : i don't know typescript
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:32:47.473000+00:00) : why is shorthand even a thing
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:32:43.457000+00:00) : i didn't know function has a shorthand form
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:32:01.282000+00:00) : so right now, it searches for the entire query
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:31:49.351000+00:00) : ah
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:31:21.539000+00:00) : i don't knmow any shorthand 😦
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:30:45.039000+00:00) : is that an angular 2.0 thing
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:30:25.961000+00:00) : dafuck is =>
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:30:02.184000+00:00) : sure
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:29:19.712000+00:00) : 1. break down the search query by spaces and strip all punctuation
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:28:40.951000+00:00) : how i would do this search would be:
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:26:52.975000+00:00) : what do you mean by minified?
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:26:28.617000+00:00) : you can assign priority values to results
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:25:33.885000+00:00) : i made some changes to it but yeah basically
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:25:21.417000+00:00) : like legend and zelda should be prioritized over the
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:25:02.067000+00:00) : but make sure that you give keywords priority too
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:24:43.177000+00:00) : no, but that's what we should have done
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:23:35.277000+00:00) : i would break down the search entry into keywords and then return all entries that match keywords
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T05:23:10.633000+00:00) : write a custom filter for search
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T04:51:28.114000+00:00) : i thought the original song was some spoof with snl but it's not
127535721857679362 (2016-09-05T04:50:34.065000+00:00) : thats some really innovative rhyming
127535721857679362 (2016-09-04T20:59:16.279000+00:00) : game stop will pay you for it
127535721857679362 (2016-09-04T20:58:40.666000+00:00) : and then put in jail
127535721857679362 (2016-09-04T20:58:31.433000+00:00) : whoever leaked that shoudl be fired
127535721857679362 (2016-09-04T20:57:45.013000+00:00) : their email addresses and where they live
127535721857679362 (2016-09-04T20:57:36.640000+00:00) : okay, because i definitely don't have a list of all your customers
127535721857679362 (2016-09-04T20:55:56.408000+00:00) : are you harambe
127535721857679362 (2016-09-04T20:48:31.514000+00:00) : is that yours

127535721857679362 (2016-09-04T02:42:25.246000+00:00) : that sucks
127535721857679362 (2016-09-03T22:23:15.817000+00:00) : it was being set as default, literally no sound was being picked up
127535721857679362 (2016-09-03T22:22:32.394000+00:00) : and can now use hdmi or a jack for sound output
127535721857679362 (2016-09-03T22:22:21.544000+00:00) : i also seem to have fixed the sound problems where my speakers weren't being detected
127535721857679362 (2016-09-03T21:55:58.734000+00:00) : i also made sure to install all available drivers this time
127535721857679362 (2016-09-03T21:55:41.975000+00:00) : and i had disabled so much stuff on my computer that it was getting slow
127535721857679362 (2016-09-03T21:55:31.326000+00:00) : the disk usage problem would pop up every so often
127535721857679362 (2016-09-03T21:54:24.610000+00:00) : so i reinstalled windows today and that seems to have made most of my computer problems go away
127535721857679362 (2016-09-03T00:21:37.178000+00:00) : i'm good for either, competitive season 2 came out for overwatch

127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T19:48:17.873000+00:00) : thats cuz it's a shitty ability and nobody uses it

127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T18:43:43.640000+00:00) : apparently it's really bad to have it enabled on a computer meant for gaming
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T18:43:17.101000+00:00) : in the background, but it seems to cause a lot of other problems
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T18:43:04.117000+00:00) : it's some kind of service that loads application data that it thinks you're going to use
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T18:42:18.422000+00:00) : i think the superfetch also caused issues, disabling superfetch has made the program go away on start up
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T18:16:05.310000+00:00) : as soon as i end the process, my disk usage returns to normal
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T18:15:53.901000+00:00) : there's a this thing called microsoft click to run service in my processes that auto starts
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T18:15:37.167000+00:00) : okay i think i figured out what's causing my disk issues
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T06:02:30.376000+00:00) : helps that fps is so high
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T06:02:19.090000+00:00) : i can usually end a game with 50-60 percent accuracy
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T06:02:06.317000+00:00) : i'm getting really good at using mccree without fan of the hammer
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T06:00:10.218000+00:00) : 5 more minutes max
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T05:40:15.506000+00:00) : you don't even play heroes that need to aim

127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T05:36:56.375000+00:00) : how is overwatch more tiring
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T05:35:17.668000+00:00) : ill probably play tomorrow and try to do battle cup
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T05:34:49.652000+00:00) : requires too much focus
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T05:34:31.026000+00:00) : dota too intense for right now
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T05:33:09.887000+00:00) : anyway i'm giong to play some realistic overwatch if any one wants to join me
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T05:32:52.493000+00:00) : i did, i did a lot of other shit too, so i don't know what actually did the fix
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T05:32:29.688000+00:00) : now it's just at bootup
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T05:32:23.107000+00:00) : before it was constant
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T05:32:10.221000+00:00) : i've tried starting it and restarting it several times and it hasn't been a problem
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T05:31:54.739000+00:00) : yeah i've seen that solution before, but since the disk issue is going away after like 30 seconds now, i'm not too worried about it anymore
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T05:31:15.629000+00:00) : lol
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T05:30:10.730000+00:00) : but i also hate it too
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T05:30:06.917000+00:00) : have
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T05:30:01.007000+00:00) : i hate disk usage issues but i think it's gotten better
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T05:04:05.675000+00:00) : mac is a dangerous boy
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T04:16:41.433000+00:00) : Bag your dick on her drums
127535721857679362 (2016-08-27T04:12:40.991000+00:00) : I can play in an hour if anyone is still on
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T21:55:26.178000+00:00) : mac if you have amazon prime, there's something called kindle first and you can get a free book from a selection of 6 every month
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T18:02:52.143000+00:00) : no damage
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T18:02:45.922000+00:00) : did you push people off a lot
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T18:02:32.832000+00:00) : i had the fifth one
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T17:49:42.423000+00:00) : is it normal to hit really high disk usage when playing games
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T16:59:11.157000+00:00) : i have some windows updates that need to be installed, i'm going to try installing those
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T16:49:32.317000+00:00) : i feel like it might be a windows 10 issue
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T16:49:25.129000+00:00) : do you think it's a driver issue then?
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T16:43:36.149000+00:00) : now nothing is particularly high but disk usage is still at 100
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T16:21:58.555000+00:00) : i think so
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T16:20:31.065000+00:00) : now i;'m pretty sure it's software
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T16:20:18.130000+00:00) : i unplugged my ethernet and it's working fine again, idk what's causing it
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T16:19:42.908000+00:00) : i also disconnected my front case connectors and plugged them back in so now my front usbs work again, i think it was just loose
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T16:18:28.013000+00:00) : like right now it's working again but i'm afraid it'll flair up again
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T16:18:08.966000+00:00) : apparently it's a common issue, but i haven't found a solution yet, it might also just go away on its own
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T16:17:50.433000+00:00) : the highlighted one was the issue when the disk usage ran high
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T16:17:34.900000+00:00) : 
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T16:16:51.685000+00:00) : it came back and then went completely away again
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T16:16:29.967000+00:00) : service host local  system network restricted (10)
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T16:11:35.748000+00:00) : and it didn't work at first, but now it's suddenly working again
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T16:11:24.735000+00:00) : so i unplugged the harddrive connections and plugged them back in
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T16:11:11.446000+00:00) : i tried restarting it and it wouldn't even boot
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T16:10:54.166000+00:00) : so for some reason my disk usage kept hitting 100 percent today and my computer became really slow.
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T15:10:06.673000+00:00) : I can't decide if I want to use graphics enhancement mods right away which will disable achievements or finish the game normally and then add mods.
127535721857679362 (2016-08-26T15:09:19.784000+00:00) : Okay I will in a bit

127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T20:25:57.430000+00:00) : do you know anything about 3 pin to molex adaptors?

127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:47:04.673000+00:00) : so it's not a defect?
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:46:03.217000+00:00) : is that supposed to be like that?

127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:45:41.819000+00:00) : 
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:42:58.588000+00:00) : cool, i like how all the wires for the psu are bundled in a mesh like material
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:40:49.952000+00:00) : like i can take off the side panels on my case from both sides
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:40:28.037000+00:00) : should i run my cables through the back panel if possible
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:34:36.831000+00:00) : okay yeah, apparently it's possible to do it both ways but pointing the fan bottom is better
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:32:09.817000+00:00) : or at least it looks like it
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:32:03.112000+00:00) : it screws in  oth ways for me
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:31:07.310000+00:00) : is the power supply fan supposed to point up or down?
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:28:30.402000+00:00) : cuz my pee comes from me and as i long as i take a shower first, my pee is clean too
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:28:12.563000+00:00) : i peed on everything
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:25:20.666000+00:00) : should i wait until everything is in before zipping up wires?
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:24:47.091000+00:00) : Okay I just plugged it into the sys fan. There wasn't a click or anything but I think it went in
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:23:23.665000+00:00) : 
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:22:58.125000+00:00) : i thought it could plug in too but i didn't know if i should
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:22:44.044000+00:00) : is that safe?
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:22:01.177000+00:00) : because i can't find a plug that fits. the fan plug has 3 prongs while the sys fan input on my motherboard has 4 prongs
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:21:42.413000+00:00) : where would they plug if they didn't plug into the motherboard?
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T18:21:32.796000+00:00) : you said the fan wires might plut into the motherboard
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T17:49:51.497000+00:00) : When I watched game of thrones I always skipped to 5 mins

127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T17:48:09.104000+00:00) : Yeah
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T17:45:08.392000+00:00) : Cool I put the motherboard on top of it now
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T17:44:13.161000+00:00) : So I wrapped it around the right and now there's a lot of extra wire
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T17:43:56.757000+00:00) : Also does the wires for the heat sink work? At first I just left it the way they came out of the box which went around the left but that kept hitting the fan
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T17:43:21.620000+00:00) : 
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T17:42:46.988000+00:00) : should i put the i/0 panel on the motherboard and try to get them both in or should i put in the io panel in the case first and fit the motherboard in after
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T17:42:04.803000+00:00) : but i had already purchased 1x16gb
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T17:41:57.647000+00:00) : i was originally only getting a motherboard with 2 slots but then i upgraded to 4 in store

127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T17:40:06.021000+00:00) : I thought it was just a placeholder or something and forgot it was rhere
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T17:39:44.086000+00:00) : There's a white box that was stuck inside the hard drive slot that has acrews
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T17:39:11.079000+00:00) : Oh I see
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T17:38:15.292000+00:00) : The case didn't come with any additional screws
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T17:37:52.557000+00:00) : But it requires and inverted hexagonal tool
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T17:37:30.025000+00:00) : And then screw the motherboard in with those
127535721857679362 (2016-08-18T17:37:19.897000+00:00) : I'm supposed to take that screw out right?

127535721857679362 (2016-08-13T21:15:09.675000+00:00) : they really should just keep split pushing
127535721857679362 (2016-08-13T21:15:03.316000+00:00) : dc has no team fight unless kunkka gets big

127535721857679362 (2016-08-13T21:10:15.898000+00:00) : they dont have much that goes through bkb

127535721857679362 (2016-08-13T21:09:58.810000+00:00) : so you have to commit to kill it or else it will just regen up
127535721857679362 (2016-08-13T21:09:50.746000+00:00) : because  melee rax has passive regen

127535721857679362 (2016-08-13T21:07:20.983000+00:00) : i feel like dc has a good chance of winning this
127535721857679362 (2016-08-13T19:56:24.073000+00:00) : It gets harder for dc as the game goes on
127535721857679362 (2016-08-13T19:56:12.749000+00:00) : I think eg has better late game but dc has the better combo
127535721857679362 (2016-08-13T19:43:57.434000+00:00) : I don't like the idea of a 2 time ti winner
127535721857679362 (2016-08-13T19:43:42.836000+00:00) : Really hope dc wins

127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T21:17:38.447000+00:00) : Nothing says a crafty independent man than a self made wallet

127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T21:15:48.074000+00:00) : Check out this wallet
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T21:12:23.083000+00:00) : That's basically a leather flap with cuts in it. Mac you should get something fancier
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T21:06:20.898000+00:00) : Oh I figured it out. That took more effort than necessary to google. I kept getting results about finance
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T21:04:48.622000+00:00) : What does a cover cost mean? Is that just the price you have to pay to get into a bar or club?
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T21:04:25.186000+00:00) : There's synthetic leather. Like the kindle cases are synthetic leather
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T21:04:03.427000+00:00) : Very possibly
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:52:30.415000+00:00) : It looks alright. You might want to go to an actual store though just to feel out textures and stuff
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:44:41.638000+00:00) : You can probably get better for less at a local bakery
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:44:27.831000+00:00) : Their parties are really expensice

127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:41:14.237000+00:00) : Also can't imagine you drinking starbucks
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:40:51.937000+00:00) : Why you put a sticker on it
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:36:45.825000+00:00) : It's just bulkier than I would like

127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:34:15.747000+00:00) : You can get a good one for 30-40 dollars
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:33:02.946000+00:00) : Just gotta burn another hour and a half
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:32:01.696000+00:00) : That way keenan can't accidentally take it and buy starbucks with it
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:31:37.800000+00:00) : Mac who even needs a wallet just carry your backpack everywhere you go
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:30:43.065000+00:00) : Get all the ladies by protecting your phone AND carrying your cash
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:30:16.067000+00:00) : Mac you should get one of those cell phone case wallets
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:29:52.544000+00:00) : They based the show off of me. But they decided to white wash it
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:28:19.792000+00:00) : I was looking at the hand and the ring and then I was like oh right, mac doesn't haven't a hithikers thumb

127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:23:49.015000+00:00) : My wallet is straight. But whatever floats your boat
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:23:05.453000+00:00) : Also don't worry about getting one that can hold change. Change is for peasants and taunting the homeless
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:22:12.182000+00:00) : I've always had a trifold and it looks like I have a tumor growing out of my thigh every time I put it in my pocket
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:21:29.022000+00:00) : Get a bifold. Trifold are kind of bulky

127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:18:33.455000+00:00) : You don't want to look like a 10 year old carrying around a synthetic wallet
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T20:18:12.130000+00:00) : Make sure it's leather
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T19:55:12.733000+00:00) : Literally every woman I've seen today are wearing skirts even the 50 year olds
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T19:54:22.147000+00:00) : Instead of a button up

127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T19:52:08.635000+00:00) : Women get to wear skirts. Kind of unfair
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T19:51:50.273000+00:00) : I got so many stares and then my manager told me it was against company rules to wear shorts even on casual fridays
127535721857679362 (2016-08-12T19:50:04.680000+00:00) : I just got reprimanded for wearing shorts to work hahaha

127535721857679362 (2016-08-11T17:59:23.556000+00:00) : That's because valve took it ofd. They don't want people to know that dire win rate is 100 percent. That would make it look like the game is rigged from the start

127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T21:55:40.626000+00:00) : Mac liquid drafted morphling, mirana and sk

127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T01:08:47.536000+00:00) : i thought he did buyback but it was just not fast enough
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T01:08:30.351000+00:00) : ember had buyback
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T01:07:43.271000+00:00) : my internet suddenly started lagging and i just saw snippets of everyone in og dying
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T01:07:08.707000+00:00) : wtf

127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T01:03:25.944000+00:00) : if void was as farmed as teh ds , tnc would probably win
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T01:02:41.509000+00:00) : at least miracle has buyback now
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T01:02:28.031000+00:00) : this is so close
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:57:26.973000+00:00) : why didn't they run the tiny wisp mid and then the ember safe
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:56:06.574000+00:00) : i think tnc just threw their lead
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:55:17.943000+00:00) : what kind of games were they?
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:54:59.890000+00:00) : what kind of games were they

127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:54:21.609000+00:00) : ah
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:54:14.972000+00:00) : also do you guys have limits to how many games you can buy in  a month or week
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:54:00.039000+00:00) : like did they plan that
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:53:55.902000+00:00) : were they together?
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:53:47.986000+00:00) : i feel like the orb effect on drow is kind of wasted 60 and 80 percent isn't that big of a didference
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:53:06.084000+00:00) : lol from one person?
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:52:54.060000+00:00) : if not better
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:52:39.171000+00:00) : wouldn't an aghs + butterfly be almost as good
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:51:56.390000+00:00) : cuz isn't drow slow like 60 percent which is already really good
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:51:45.658000+00:00) : is it actually worth it
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:51:36.124000+00:00) : or do they just do manual switchees
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:51:14.970000+00:00) : does drow's orb stackwith skadi now?
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:15:40.452000+00:00) : and then he used flame guard and a bunch of psirits dodging the autoattacks
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:15:09.543000+00:00) : i think huskar probably ulted him and he dodged it with sleight of fist
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:14:54.252000+00:00) : i didn't see the play from miracle
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:05:09.015000+00:00) : were they open qualifers?
127535721857679362 (2016-08-10T00:03:35.934000+00:00) : ogre was twerking
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:57:16.981000+00:00) : or do they just have to look at the screen
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:57:10.565000+00:00) : when the vr is going
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:57:06.610000+00:00) : what does the crowd see
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:52:46.154000+00:00) : yeah they're not cocky
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:51:33.518000+00:00) : but chlorine kills pee
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:50:43.483000+00:00) : the pool just went green and nobody know how or why
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:50:16.490000+00:00) : what the actual fuck rio
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:50:12.201000+00:00) : http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/09/sport/rio-olympics-green-pool/index.html
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:40:12.664000+00:00) : omg how is og losing to tnc
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:38:42.250000+00:00) : if it didn't work, it basically gauranteed we would lose
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:38:17.268000+00:00) : people on the other team would freak out
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:38:00.567000+00:00) : mac, asher, and i used to run this 5 man lvl1 rosh and death ball strat where we take roshan at lvl 1 and 5 man push mid
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:37:06.526000+00:00) : It takes a lot of factors into account that its really hard to pinpoint an exact criteria
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:35:41.615000+00:00) : Everyone knows where the optimal positions are so it's often better to place a ward in a not so optimal position than to place it in an optimal one where it will be found
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:35:00.637000+00:00) : That's where it gets hard, especially in pro games
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:33:17.495000+00:00) : The general position is determined by where you think the other team will be in the next 6 minutes. You always want to be able to watch the other team without them knowing you are watching them
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:32:12.880000+00:00) : If you can trade evenly in a 4 v 5 fight while your pos 1 is farming that's usually considered a success
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:31:42.857000+00:00) : Split pushing and grouping the other 4 people to attack the other teams carry
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:31:08.279000+00:00) : Like 0-10 mins is the laning stage, 10-35 is the mid game, 35-50 is kinda late 50-70 is late and 70+ is super late where almost all heroes are at full xp and farm
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:29:15.318000+00:00) : Not really it has more to do with the time
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:28:58.039000+00:00) : I'd you're weak early, you want to dodge fights and distract the other team from attacking your pos 1 core
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:28:25.070000+00:00) : Like if your team is strong early and the other team is weak early. You want to put pressure early and constantly fjght
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:27:55.858000+00:00) : Item timings, player positions on the map, and team composition
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:27:32.719000+00:00) : Professional games dictate like 80 percent of public game metas
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:26:58.829000+00:00) : Slight tweaks to his skills and how professional players fit him in drafts
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:25:26.049000+00:00) : For example, riki used to be a shit tier/pocket draft carey. Now he's a tier 1 support
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:24:46.190000+00:00) : It most depends on the heroes skills and how falls into the current meta
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:24:30.232000+00:00) : On the dota client, there's decriptions of every hero but no one really follows that
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:24:04.780000+00:00) : Depending on itemization, how much farm is taken, and how well you can play it
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:23:23.894000+00:00) : There's loose guides but almost every hero can be played in every position
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:21:50.511000+00:00) : Of course most of the time the ideal lineups don't happen and aren't always the most effective so it's all about which team cab adjust
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:20:50.371000+00:00) : 3 heroes that take farm. 2 get items that can kill other heroes.the third gets items that help team fights like silences, aoe damage, heals
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:19:22.097000+00:00) : 2 of the cores should be able to do sustained damage the third should be an intiator
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:18:51.738000+00:00) : You typically want 3 cores and 2 supports
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:17:56.858000+00:00) : You  can also guess based on the hero and timing
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:16:14.551000+00:00) : But not how much gold they have
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:16:08.447000+00:00) : Yeah
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:16:07.266000+00:00) : That's also why a lot of the times when someone e gets a big item, they will remain off the map until they can use it
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:15:17.663000+00:00) : You have to manually check everytime someone else is on the map. It's something most people at lower tiers don't do
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:14:42.996000+00:00) : There's also a lot of other factors involved
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:13:49.630000+00:00) : Typically heroes that are more spell dependent are more level dependent and heroes that use right click are more farm dependent
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:13:08.604000+00:00) : Yeah
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:12:55.719000+00:00) : That was the strategy at ti4
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:12:42.591000+00:00) : You can get 5 early game heroes and hope to destroy the early game and win by 30 minutes
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:11:50.425000+00:00) : There's a really flexible amount of each type of hero. And some combinations will be effective at different times
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:10:14.628000+00:00) : And she would still be effective
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:10:07.870000+00:00) : You can have a farmed naga with little xp
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:09:50.619000+00:00) : Mac that's not true
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:09:46.563000+00:00) : Some heroes need xp, some need farm, some need both, some need neithet
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:08:24.592000+00:00) : Farm is gold not xp
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:06:31.346000+00:00) : The support that isn't the ward bitch is also known as the "I don't take farm but I won't buy support items"
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:05:14.446000+00:00) : There's space taker, space creator, utility/initiation, high impact support and ward bitch
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:00:58.700000+00:00) : There used to a hero that caused the game to crash if it died for a bit of a patch. That was hero was banned from tournaments. That was pretty funny
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T23:00:16.061000+00:00) : Cuz he might not be balanced
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T22:59:57.769000+00:00) : Only the newest hero isn't allowed in competitive
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T22:59:46.410000+00:00) : No she is. Idk if they took her out when they changed her but she definitely is now.
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T22:29:40.150000+00:00) : Or tom can drive and the rest of the team fpies
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T22:27:31.230000+00:00) : And then fly yourselves
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T22:27:22.424000+00:00) : You can get the equipment shipped professionally
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T22:26:30.112000+00:00) : Ah
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T22:26:28.631000+00:00) : Aj

127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T22:25:43.768000+00:00) : Did you bring your soy lent with you

127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T22:22:02.915000+00:00) : I don't think I can see that portion since I'm on the Russian stream
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T22:19:54.524000+00:00) : Idk what that is
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T22:19:49.322000+00:00) : If tnc wins I'm gonna be so pissed
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T22:17:44.635000+00:00) : What's the next game?
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T22:16:43.510000+00:00) : I guess void had bkb
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T22:16:37.053000+00:00) : Of disarm the void
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T22:16:31.375000+00:00) : Idk why he doesn't just use the disarm since void doesn't do enough physical damage
127535721857679362 (2016-08-09T22:15:57.128000+00:00) : They weren't

127535721857679362 (2016-07-31T08:35:54.108000+00:00) : the suggested build used a micro case but i switched to a regular one
127535721857679362 (2016-07-31T08:35:41.175000+00:00) : i just picked that one because it was in one of the suggested builds

This can happen when a tile has been modified with an outside program, or by a copy utility that doesn't preserve mtimes. Overviewer uses the filesystem's mtimes to determine which tiles need rendering and which don't, so it's important to preserve the mtimes Overviewer sets. Please see our FAQ page on docs.overviewer.org or ask us in IRC for more information
