240129712645603329 (2017-06-03T15:52:09.977000+00:00) : Hey. I have 800 brothers. Get it right.
240129712645603329 (2017-06-03T15:42:08.281000+00:00) : <@125452744440938497> I was there too! It was definitely depressing.
240129712645603329 (2017-06-02T01:36:51.487000+00:00) : Sweeeeeeet then it's a date
240129712645603329 (2017-06-02T01:34:23.721000+00:00) : Can you do like Monday evening? This weekend is real bad for me, with MAYBE the exception of Saturday night depending on whether or not my friend wants to take photos that night.
240129712645603329 (2017-05-16T15:51:42.297000+00:00) : Good God I hate everything about this

240129712645603329 (2017-03-07T19:38:02.630000+00:00) : The combat makes it feel like a spiritual successor to Devil May Cry, which makes it A-OK in my book.
240129712645603329 (2017-03-07T19:37:26.356000+00:00) : I've just played the demo but I'm getting it after I get paid.

240129712645603329 (2017-01-18T01:59:29.797000+00:00) : I wanna watch it again but I'm watching Magic:/
240129712645603329 (2017-01-18T01:59:12.406000+00:00) : But it's so INTERESTING

240129712645603329 (2017-01-11T17:47:50.109000+00:00) : Do you mean you just look at walkthroughs and stuff?
240129712645603329 (2017-01-10T00:49:35.996000+00:00) : This isn't like one of my Japanese animes!!!
240129712645603329 (2017-01-10T00:36:06.934000+00:00) : Have you fought Psycho Mantis yet? I can't remember what order you fight bosses in.
240129712645603329 (2017-01-10T00:32:44.792000+00:00) : Keenan are you playing MGS?
240129712645603329 (2017-01-09T22:57:06.067000+00:00) : Also I love Platinum. I'm super excited for Nier. That's the saving grace of this situation.
240129712645603329 (2017-01-09T22:56:12.515000+00:00) : I actually care about the game üò¶ I was super hype to learn I could play it on PC.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-30T16:22:44.690000+00:00) : Shit <@!125452744440938497> I never saw your invitation to play OW. üò¶
240129712645603329 (2016-12-29T19:53:29.368000+00:00) : Why not?
240129712645603329 (2016-12-29T01:50:36.265000+00:00) : The part where it deviates from the familiar Zelda theme is just so. AH.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-29T01:49:19.903000+00:00) : Can we talk about how this is the best LoZ overworld theme? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULyEY_GjSoA
240129712645603329 (2016-12-28T23:32:17.274000+00:00) : I'm sure I'll be free! I have no plans for NYE.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-28T20:47:00.889000+00:00) : Moon is gonna be the game I get every Grass type in. I can feel it.

240129712645603329 (2016-12-27T18:26:05.352000+00:00) : You might have to look into some other mods then. I don't know much about combat mods but I'm sure they're out there. And yeah, questing is more important than dungeon crawling because that's how you find the cool dungeons.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-27T18:20:56.891000+00:00) : Like the main quest? How much time have you put into the game?
240129712645603329 (2016-12-27T18:15:08.105000+00:00) : The unofficial Oblivion patch is the main one. Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul is good if you've played the game before.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-23T05:31:25.377000+00:00) : I'll be seeing it a couple more times, I'm sure. I love all the characters so freaking much.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-23T05:22:41.662000+00:00) : Chirrut and Baze hit me the hardest, I think.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-23T05:22:25.036000+00:00) : Too
240129712645603329 (2016-12-23T05:22:21.904000+00:00) : Me too, man. Me oops
240129712645603329 (2016-12-23T04:57:38.683000+00:00) : I'm glad you liked it! I saw it again tonight. It's so emotionally draining for me.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-23T04:48:51.239000+00:00) : That video is so good!
240129712645603329 (2016-12-20T03:24:36.377000+00:00) : Also we're leveling up every stat in succession. These aren't great characters.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-20T03:24:11.321000+00:00) : <@155893986605793281> Leann and I are racing through different parts of the game Tour de France style. She just beat Sif before me. That ladder leading up to him was killer. I just died once.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-18T17:24:30.553000+00:00) : I'm only playing for like 15 minutes til my gf gets out of the shower üò¶
240129712645603329 (2016-12-16T03:21:55.622000+00:00) : No Dota. Only Rogue One.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T21:27:08.716000+00:00) : I just know Win8 is notorious for this kind of stuff.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T21:26:57.153000+00:00) : Maybe I'm jumping the gun. It's hard to troubleshoot without being there in person.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T21:23:59.994000+00:00) : I think something got fricked in your Windows installation somehow.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T21:23:39.157000+00:00) : You can get that from IU, put it on a USB, and keep all of your current files.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T21:23:24.549000+00:00) : Wanna update to Windows 10?
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T21:19:53.695000+00:00) : One thing you could try is unplugging the power cable from the computer and holding the power button for ten seconds to flush all the power out of the computer and kind of reset it, but I don't know how likely that is to do anything.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T21:18:16.522000+00:00) : I'm thinking you could make a live Linux USB and scan your drive for errors. It could just be that your boot sector is corrupt.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T21:16:59.176000+00:00) : Do you have another computer of any kind?
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T21:16:14.397000+00:00) : Restart your computer and press F8 or shift F8. That should put you into a menu where you can choose to boot into safe mode.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T21:14:17.094000+00:00) : ?
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T21:14:15.753000+00:00) : I don't think your HDD is fucked or it probs wouldn't get that far. And you got to the menu that let you choose to boot into Safe Mode>
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T21:09:36.609000+00:00) : Are you on 8 or something?
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T21:06:37.345000+00:00) : You're on Windows 10?
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T21:02:53.323000+00:00) : And the BIOS says you don't have any boot devices?
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T21:01:14.726000+00:00) : Did anything happen before it crashed? I know I'm asking dumb questions but I have to bc I'm a IT guy.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T20:49:56.593000+00:00) : Keenan is this a laptop or a desktop?
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T03:46:48.291000+00:00) : Him
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T03:46:46.336000+00:00) : Keenan plz. I love hom5
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T03:45:08.227000+00:00) : Asher I didn't know it was from anything when you sent me that snap of BB-8. I thought you were just calling him a cuck ball
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T01:20:30.116000+00:00) : Big spoiler
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T00:23:13.057000+00:00) : It's fine if we don't. I do wanna play something soon though. It's been too long since I've played OW.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T00:22:44.280000+00:00) : Yep!
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T00:21:54.115000+00:00) : I started playing again at work today.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T00:21:48.080000+00:00) : Oh, sadness. I was hoping you'd wanna play.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T00:19:10.354000+00:00) : Any particular reason you don't want her playing games?
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T00:18:55.719000+00:00) : Seems solid. It is nice to always have someone to play Diablo with though. She's really only ever played Dark Souls so I'm getting her to branch out.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T00:16:30.467000+00:00) : Decent, I guess. She just gave light guidance when necessary through 1 and 2. Three I did mostly on my own, and Bloodborne is going that way as well.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T00:13:41.104000+00:00) : Yeah, we started talking over spring break last year through a mutual friend and she said she'd coach me through Dark Souls. That's how we bonded.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T00:09:06.306000+00:00) : Yeah, Hillcrest. We gotta move some shit over to my house, which is thankfully down the street. And I'm seeing Rogue One tomorrow evening :l
240129712645603329 (2016-12-15T00:04:11.929000+00:00) : God I wanna but I'm helping my girlfriend move :( Maybe later?
240129712645603329 (2016-12-13T18:59:42.806000+00:00) : He's got another year and a half, I think, but he should be a senior.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-13T18:59:26.471000+00:00) : He spent a bunch of time screwing around and my parents weren't gonna pay for a private university anymore. Lol
240129712645603329 (2016-12-13T18:54:43.649000+00:00) : I think he's seen you around a few times, but always from a distance. He's been at Anderson for the last few years. This is his first semester at IU.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-13T18:51:59.644000+00:00) : That's not super surprising. He looks a LOT different than he used to. Where'd you see him?
240129712645603329 (2016-12-12T23:45:01.627000+00:00) : But I can't tonight. So I shouldn't have said anything.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-12T23:44:44.898000+00:00) : Also anything because I haven't played games with you guys in forever.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-12T23:44:28.541000+00:00) : I'm down for WWF!!!!
240129712645603329 (2016-12-11T07:52:14.930000+00:00) :

240129712645603329 (2016-12-09T17:00:24.021000+00:00) : <@!155893986605793281> Keenan do you have a link to a good Dwarf Fortress tutorial?
240129712645603329 (2016-12-09T16:23:40.597000+00:00) : And I get to bug you guys with random Dark Souls musings.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-09T16:23:28.268000+00:00) : Apparently there's a Discord app for ChromeOS so now I don't have to be so absent when I'm at work.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-09T16:23:02.813000+00:00) : Artorias is such a cool boy.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-09T02:13:26.602000+00:00) : <:god:230133457630658562>
240129712645603329 (2016-12-09T02:13:19.400000+00:00) : #love
240129712645603329 (2016-12-08T19:07:59.838000+00:00) : What have I stumbled in on
240129712645603329 (2016-12-07T04:03:39.207000+00:00) : Okay. I need to know what I'm getting into when I pick up the game. I wanna play through the game with a team of grass types.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-07T04:00:49.540000+00:00) : What's the coolest grass type to come out of this gen? I gotta know.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-04T03:37:36.462000+00:00) : It's pretty amazing. Just my absolute favorite thing in the entire world.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-04T03:27:00.956000+00:00) : Sweet! You wanna meet up beforehand?
240129712645603329 (2016-12-04T03:18:58.357000+00:00) : Yep! West side.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-04T02:59:50.134000+00:00) : Yeah, I'm down to go!
240129712645603329 (2016-12-04T02:59:44.921000+00:00) : N
240129712645603329 (2016-12-04T02:59:42.730000+00:00) : WE ON THE ROGUE ONE HYPE TRAI
240129712645603329 (2016-12-01T22:24:13.437000+00:00) : There is no middle ground.
240129712645603329 (2016-12-01T22:24:08.560000+00:00) : Yeah, I would agree with you. Old people are either the best customers or the worst customers.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-29T20:56:43.400000+00:00) : I disagree. But dasjusme. Nix hounds should not be so fearsome.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-29T20:51:57.873000+00:00) : That game is great but so frustrating.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-29T20:51:50.293000+00:00) : It's too bad you can swing right through your target and not hit them tho
240129712645603329 (2016-11-29T20:51:24.997000+00:00) : 
240129712645603329 (2016-11-29T20:51:06.745000+00:00) : The Morrowind theme was the best though am I right
240129712645603329 (2016-11-27T03:20:41.514000+00:00) : Keenan there was just too much. If I had someone showing me in person I could probably do it. The game still intrigues me.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-27T03:18:28.102000+00:00) : <@155893986605793281> Holy shit so much less micromanagement than DF. I tried with that game. I really freaking did.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-27T03:11:52.356000+00:00) : <@127535721857679362> It has a bit of a learning curve, but I love it even when my cities fail. Traffic management is hell, though.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-26T21:04:50.458000+00:00) : I can see it happening if it lives up to what it's started out to be. It's also just adorable.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-26T21:01:12.387000+00:00) : I went back and forth on whether or not I wanted it and I gotta say I'm not disappointed. It reminds me so much of Harvest Moon, which is one of my favorite games.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-26T00:52:07.818000+00:00) : Old speculation threads are great, especially for Star Wars.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-24T06:00:19.078000+00:00) : I got Bloodborne for $20 a few weeks ago. The prices drop as time goes on.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-23T18:01:21.536000+00:00) : Have you guys seen the new Zelda game they're making?
240129712645603329 (2016-11-20T19:21:26.366000+00:00) : GARY'S FUCKIN MOD
240129712645603329 (2016-11-20T19:17:48.964000+00:00) : By "games" do you mean Dota or Overwatch? Bc I can play Overwatch, but not Dota.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-19T04:21:25.899000+00:00) : <@!127535721857679362>
240129712645603329 (2016-11-19T01:36:27.447000+00:00) : i forgot how bad I am at this.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-19T00:57:34.722000+00:00) : Tis okay, I'm eating anyway. Just got back with my 'za.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-19T00:17:20.513000+00:00) : Yay ‚ù§ That also gives me time for food.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-19T00:15:01.875000+00:00) : <:curse:248225815005757442>

240129712645603329 (2016-11-19T00:13:39.747000+00:00) : Oh no Asher I didn't see your invite is it too late to play HotS?
240129712645603329 (2016-11-18T21:07:09.688000+00:00) : I too love the Ricky emote. <:curse:248225815005757442>
240129712645603329 (2016-11-17T21:49:51.336000+00:00) : I lied, Divinity is only two players. Sigh.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-17T20:53:12.798000+00:00) : No really. You are only being joshed. But I don't want you to play.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-17T20:50:39.915000+00:00) : I'm just joshin' ya!
240129712645603329 (2016-11-17T20:50:23.357000+00:00) : Asher you me and Keenan were gonna play together anyway. It was gonna be a three way. I can only really play Sunday so we'll work something out for then. Keenan if you don't wanna play you don't have to.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-17T20:46:28.900000+00:00) : Huh. I've never seen "definitely" spelled "maybe" before. English is weird.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-17T20:41:04.268000+00:00) : No Keenan you could be one of the great ones. We gotta play it! I have a copy I can distribute to you.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-17T20:39:51.909000+00:00) : Soooooo do you wanna play with me?
240129712645603329 (2016-11-17T20:37:55.358000+00:00) : Do any of you guys play Divinity? Did I ask that already?
240129712645603329 (2016-11-17T02:03:36.719000+00:00) : I'm looking for a new RPG to get sucked into like Baldur's Gate, and I'm hoping Pillars is the one. Divinity is really good too.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-17T01:49:11.554000+00:00) : Because I need to show my friend Miranda.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-17T01:48:39.174000+00:00) : does anyone have all the screencaps of the exchange with ricky hopson?
240129712645603329 (2016-11-16T17:28:54.722000+00:00) : Are you guys playing Cookie Clicker right now because if you aren't you should be.
240129712645603329 (2016-11-16T04:34:29.245000+00:00) : Sweeeeet. Let's git gud together bc I kinda suck

240129712645603329 (2016-11-14T23:25:13.893000+00:00) : I was down for the game but I was NOT down for hanging out with Cody's infamous "dad."
240129712645603329 (2016-11-14T23:05:04.869000+00:00) : I forgot about that part. Like. wtf. I just remember being so uncomfortable trying to come up with a way to tell him no.

there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
