I've discovered the ultimate underhanded plan to hang out with ben more
And I got her to ask Ben
lol so Clara and her housemate are looking for a 3rd for next year (or maybe semester?
Idr)
Don't do drugs
stay in school, ok buddy?
I'm glad we could vibe like this and keep it tight
You're a good young man with a bright future
not very 'swag' at all, huh?
let alone 3!
and then my hands were shaking too bad to hold even one fidget spinner
look mac I used to mainline black tar heroin
isnt that pretty 'swag'?
but take a look at these fidget spinner tricks i can do
teens have it tough in todays modern high-powered life
look mac
do you know what the word problematic means?
lets rap
hey mac
*flips chair backwards and sits down*
idk that seems like osmething we would say to be fair
Yeah I've heard the new season is really good
Apparently dark Willow is voiced by Ashley Burch, and pangolier is voiced by Phil Lamarr who was Hermes in Futurama
I'll be home in like 15 minutes
Just asher being emo
So nothing too dramatic
I cheered up a little after a glass of wine and an hour of Death Race 2000 but I still didn't feel great about the whole thing overall
So I was just kinda sullen and miserable and quiet for the first hour or so and was feeling real bad for doing that to my friend
And also I've been in a bad mood about other stuff and was not feeling great that night
And Lina didn't really react to me in any particular way, she was doing the thing she does where you know she picks up on social cues but doesn't act at all like she does
And we were the first ones there
I brought my friend Rachel partially bc I felt bad since I had told her I was gonna hang w her that night and because she sorta knows Lina from online
And we hadn't messaged at all since then
Which doesn't necessarily mean it wasn't true, I was just kinda done
Especially because the third time in a row she used the exact same excuse about having car trouble that she told me another time
mostly just that
I didn't tell her I was coming
Like I said I hadn't talked to her on a bit and wasn't really on the best terms I guess?
Oh so
Riding high
I got a 96 on my math 171 midterm and a 114 on my second calc midterm
Ye
I'll play with u when I get off work tonight
<@!155893986605793281> Sarah Palmer's middle name is 'judith' and she is 100% frogmoth girl

I'll be home in 5 boys
Thank you Mac that anecdote has made my night 100% better
Because we're both hateful deep down
And her friends are just the kind of awkward dorky chipper I could maybe handle at my best but not really right now
I've just been in a really bad emotional place and I haven't even talked to lina since the start of the semester when she flaked out on me on the same day three weeks in a row
All we've done so far is at a terrible board game with mst3k on in the background
Oh it's definitely me and not the event lol
I'm currently in the throes of anxiety at an event at Lina's house lol
I can maybe play around like 11
They can't keep me from anime tiddies
PURGE ANALYSIS
Or Magnus?
Maybe enigma?
Meh buildup, bad stats, very little control over when it triggers, u don't do damage while the invuln is active
Idk who is gonna build aeon disk
Urn seems p good for supports
I still think meteor is gonna have some crazy hero comboes for how cheap it is
I'm not sure about the new items
pangoboy has a very good auttoattack sound
<@!71716577669550080> want to watch my test client footage
im lost after that
(hei
https://gyazo.com/2ecf766c99fc34d13efae43b62294c41
Yeah, but them announcing it now def seems related
<@155893986605793281> welp they cancelled house of cards lol
Also Ronald agi giving movespeed is big for morph
Build 3 of them and combo with axe=gg
Yeah but the damage numbers And the fact it can hurt buildings seems strong for how cheap it is
The new meteor item seems crazy broken
And the level 25 talent gives it multishot lol
Monkey king +100 wukongs command armor or 1 extra wukongs command circle
Pretty much all the level 25 talents are insane
Lol one of rikis level 25 talents is attacking doesn't take you out of invis
Apparently there's an io talent now where tether applies aghs???
It's a lot
Mines
Techies
Moving
Moving techies mines
Ronald
New techies build Midas drums send minefields around the map with movespeed aura
Yeah morphling is a different hero now basically
At level 25 techies mines can move around the map
Fuck
So tiny now has 0 agility without items I guess?
Invoker has a talent that turns sunstrike into the chest trap from siltbreaker lmao
You can use it to push high ground noe
Glyph works on creeps
Wraith king can summon skeletons now
Or since I've been playing at least
This actually might be the biggest patch ever
You gain an enemy heroes look and stats and basic abilities
It's kind of like his old aghs
MEAT HOOK NOW CAN PULL RUNES
Also morph has a new ult I guess
<@127535721857679362> mirana leap now has 3 charges
Poison touch now has splash and gets refreshed when u attack them
Brood webs don't grant invis but you don't lose their bonuses when u take damage
Beastmasters summon now summons a random neural creep at Max level
Keenan I literally cannot think about anything that's not these patch notes rn
Battlefury uses demon edge now
Pulling is now different bc neutrals killing creeps doesn't deny the xp
Courier now has a shield instead of speed boost
They streamlined how health/Mana regen work
Int increases magic resistance
Agility increases movespeed
Strength now reduces status effect  duration
I don't know this update is fucking huge
And a new relic item that I guess is the bkb counter?
It applies 'mute' for 5 seconds
There's an item that's an urn upgrade
R u being sarcastic
They finally added the int hero sange/yasha equivalent
This new item gives a strong dispel and 2.5 seconds damage immunity every 100 seconds when you take damage under 80% health
What the fuck
5 NEW ITEMS
Pms also removed
Iron talon has been removed from the game LMAO
The fuck u can't buy phase boots at side shop now
Courier upgrades automatically
Neutrals now sleep at night
Third Roshan drops a single use refresher orb what the FUCK
No shrines in base
Tp scroll starts on cooldown
'heroes now start the game with a tp scroll'
RONALD THEY DID IT JUST FOR YOU
ABILITY DRAFT UPDATE
ITS HAPPENING
OH FUCK
https://i.redd.it/x2a5syuosdtz.png

https://www.avclub.com/anthony-rapp-claims-kevin-spacey-made-a-sexual-advance-1819959859

lol mac
ok someone please keep me company while i finish this game
How do you do the poems that fast
Yeah
I think you have to delete your save file
Now you need to look up how to get the happy ending lol
I'm gonna come home and play it as soon as I'm done w work lol
It makes me feel good at platforming
I like that level
Yeah I was alone and getting too scared lol
Like where all the dialogue goes tot hat and that's the only button
Just monika
What happened?
Lmao
Sam's roomate
Lol I tinder matched with reilly
Ooo
Like how can u have a job grading calc quizzes and also work out 12+4 as17
C) didn't even add the point values of the two problems together correctly
B) gave me less points than someone who did all the same steps but got the  derivative wrong
A) gave me half as many points as someone with the same answer for the first problem
Yeah so the grader for this quiz with 2 problems on it
I need to talk to my calc teacher about this quiz I just got back because I think the graders just played calvinball with this one
Lol nice
Aw I'm sorry
what a game
ok i just had to stop  before i gave myself nightmares
<@!71716577669550080>
so
we should all get in chat
alright time to get drunk and reenter doki-doki world
Third poem is when the main thrust of things come into motion
Nice
Which poem are you on?
Yeah that's definitely part of it
She really is
Just keep playing
Just keep playing
Yes
Yep
Yes
Yeah he really threads the needle there
I picked manga girl actually
DO this as soon as possible and get back to me
just play a couple hours of it
dont read anything about it at all
its free
get your laptop, go to steam, and download doki-doki literature club
tomorrow, anytime you have a couple hours free
<@!155893986605793281> keenan
but its good wish fulfillment
i still am not sure i've gotten to what everyones hyped about
very relaxing
this games pretty good
so far i've exhanged poetry criticism with several cute coeds
dont google anything about it ill let you know what my findings are
ive been told its worth it
In case you cant read my shitty picture, this anime game entitled 'doki doki literature club' has a trigger warning

Hey guys real quick what the fuck

And I think I need to replay bc there's a hat hidden in the attic
Yeah that shits freaky
It's nice aesthetically yeah
Especially compared to the train murder
The city is cool but the first level is literally nothing lol
The one thing that bothered me about that world is how much more interesting the train levels are than the penguin levels
Yeah once they hit you once it fucks everything up
Lol yea
Also if you just jump over his sawblade attacks they'll never hit you
Yeah
The only attack he has that's hard to dodge is the Disco balls cause they stagger you
Honestly though once I took a break and came back to it I beat him in 1 try
Yeah
It's fairly similar yea
The level before the boss is p dope as well
If you hang out in the room w the world 2 telescope after you beat it you get a phone call
The have the Collins audience
Yeah
Very simple
I think my favorite audience q was some woman asking 'how do I stop my dog from coming into my room while I fuck'
And they can't even get that far
Literally all they have to do is set up some mildly off at scenario for the brothers to riff on
Imo any question that has the potential to be ended with 'am I good?' is a bad question because it's just some dumb story from your life
Woof you weren't kidding about these live show questions huh
If I'm ever in a position where I need to dress formally ever I will
Very cool but very expensive
It looks so comfy
Yes
Bc I want one
Is there a technical term for the robe thing Wallace is wearing?
Yeah
Yeah the clothes don't get too crazy
Lol
The cowboy Bebop guy made one of them
Also thanks for reminding me I need to find and watch the prequel animes they made
I feel like that pun is almost implied in the name because that's basically the only other way she could 'have sex' with anyone
I want a joi JOI
You can prolly just use redbubble
It's a dope coat
<@!155893986605793281> make sure to grab a star wars ticket at some point, 7pm showing on december 14th
I'm gonna pick her up.
She has dance until 8:15 so I'm not sure she's gonna have time to study
9:30
Clara's coming
Mac come watch blade runner with us

i told you man
lol
<@!71716577669550080> IM HOME PLAY WITH ME
Had to dissilusion a customer of the idea that when maple trees are in season, you just tap them and maple syrup comes out
I know but it's worth it
Trust me it's worth it if you say 'penis'
When you get to the part where someone asks what body part you are most ashamed of
Oh also
You get to star in it
Even better
I'm gonna play more the second I get home fear not
What do you mean Mac?
I have it open because I'm stuck on a boss fight and had to go to work
That does sound pretty good
Yes
Nice
That you git gud casul?
Can I suggest
Its not like you listen to the dot OST anyway
The original has a more quotable and striking script for sure
Yea
Ben and I watched the original last night and I think 2049 might actually be better
I can't Wednesday and amc doesn't even have showtimes listed for it past then
Blade runner?
Keenan
Blade runner again tomorrow night?
She was with a very ugly man
Not as much actually.
I would have had no idea it was her if she hadn't asked my name
She looks very different
Also Keenan Kaela came into the store today
And I'm to the true final boss on the 2nd world and a decent way through the third
I've done everything in the first world including the vortex thingys up till the point where you need some item to continue
Mac how far are you in hat in time?
Would be nice
Shit the forest level got real spooky
such a good kid
eh maybe
<@!240129712645603329>  play with me
<@!155893986605793281> https://somuchforhomebarbering.tumblr.com/

It's weird to think about because dune is kind of the sci fi polar opposite of blade runner
And arrival
No but I really want to now
Is denis Villeneuves dune gonna be any good?
So what do we think
I feel like that's probably the difference between blade runner and ghost in the shell
Yo for real I thought the effects of her being translucent early on in the movie looked just ok but that sex scene was one of the most beautiful sfx sequences I've ever seen
She was great
Also there were so many closeup  shots of Ryan goslings face that were framed and lit like they could be paintings
I want to just watch those scenes of them walking up the stairs in Jared letos house over and over
God so good
CELLS INTERLINKED WITHING CELLS
CELLS INTERLINKED WITHING CELLS
"TOUCHING HANDS ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF A GLASS WINDOW.
INTERCONNECTED"
"HOLDING THE ONE YOU LOVE.
INTERCONNECTED"
Every time one of us had a breakup or rough night or something we just get on the phone and yell at each other
I do like that idea though keenan
Exactly
You should watch the new one Mac i think you'd enjoy it actually
Yes and I loved it
Running time 2049 minutes
Apparently a bunch of those lines in the test were from pale fire by Nabokov, a novel I really need to read
That was the exact point when I decided that the movie was awesome
Fuck yeah
You mean the baseline test?
But the horses the horse soldiers were riding were definitely fake
I think the bees were real
Fuck
Also a replicant
That crazy assassin lady?
The whole time
That K was actually a replicant
On reddit
So Keenan, I read this crazy theory
No
Hmm idk how big the venue is, it'd be nice to be able to see them well but that could be variable
I can hopefully skip it
I only work till noon and I only have one class that day
I could prolly swing that
Why do you ask
What day is that
Oh fuck that's great
Yeah 1 sec
cool hopefully i will have finished climbing this spooky tree by then
Whys this owl who doesn't look like an own have a Scottish accent
@everyone dota or pubg?
Did someone break in?
Damn
I do not
I still haven't gotten my Undertale collectors edition but they sent me a code for a PlayStation them and it's dope
You need to tell me your story though what happened?
Yeah hours of doom metal
I don't think there's any single women here lol
I'm at doomed and stoned fest at a bar up and indy
What the fuck
I'm the only one at this show not wearing a black tshirt
I know Yoko taro said he really wanted to play it but was waiting for a translation
Has it been translated yet?
Yeah it's a bummer
And it's pretty funny
They're a very good size
Yeah I played the first two levels
Mac have you started playing yet?
Yeah it's coming on consoles but I can't find a release date
this games super charming
<@!127535721857679362> do you wanna play dota
:-

I think I'm gonna buy a hat in time tonight it looks really fun
I've seen so many variants of those
Cool
O
Express?
there pretty rough im sorry
yeah those combos get intense
what the shit
is there a leaderboard who who has the most video games
is there a leaderboard

I have not, incredibly
This new chest is actually pretty dope for once
And here I thought that customer service was your heart + soul
Do you know why he changed the system?
Goddamn I hate Ron so much
Damn why?
That's good, what game is that
Lmao
Thursdays are also good
But that's yr dance night thing
Saturday is more optimal cuz I don't have work the next day
Also please actually beat it because I feel bad for not doing so
Let me do acid with you sometime and I'll consider it repayed
Oh
For what
I think nier has the better soundtrack overall
https://store.na.square-enix.com/product/460239/nier-gestalt-replicant-original-soundtrack-vinyl
It has really pretty cover art of kaine
I may have pre-ordered a limited vinyl set of the nier gestalt/replicant ost today
Or I could borrow mgsv from you whenever I get through the first 4
I don't have ps+
We're making quadcopters in my engineering class and 1 group was working on putting the DotA logo on their frameplates lol

<@!240129712645603329> want to play pubg with us?
lmao
<@!127535721857679362>  want to play
This is also the farthest I've ever gotten in dkc which is kinda sad
Super Mario rpg is pretty fun
<@71716577669550080> <@155893986605793281> I'm at best buy, is this still something we're doing?
i feel like i matched with that person
I'm hype
Fuck yes
Shit man
You have acid???
Keenan I can also bring us some very fresh zombie dust
I haven't smoked in weeks and I really need to forget my cares for a bit
Yes I do
So that if Mac finds a line at 6:30 we'll still be pleasantly stoned and mellow about the whole thing
I think keenan and I should party the fuck down Thursday night
<@71716577669550080> did we decide when we're going out for the snes
And one of those bootleg 'calvin from Calvin and Hobbes pissing on something' stickers featuring Calvin in a Coke hat pissing on the Pepsi logo
A 'coca-cola collector' sticker
A 'buy a friend a Coca-Cola' sticker
A Vietnam vet sticker
Yesterday I was behind a guy with the following bumper stickers:
Finally we can play chess in the comfort of our homes, without having to go to nearby public parks
😢
<@!71716577669550080> do you want to play a game of pubg with me?
I need to leave for Indy around 11:30
So when would I have to show up if it's not?
Is it a midnight release?
O fuk
<@155893986605793281> we need to watch this ezra koenig anime together sometime
<@!71716577669550080> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oM6eZJRurFk&list=PL49043EBE4B5A8792
I know I hate it

It was fun
They had a creepy nurse and giant pyramid head and this wall-crawling thing
<@155893986605793281> i went to a haunted house that had a silent hill section
<@!71716577669550080> woo

Get back to us on that one
Does 'the Golden circle' refer to that one girl's butthole?
nostalgia ho
theres a fancy pants adventure game on steam
holy fuvk
It's deempus
What synergy
Now you can play Skyrim from anywhere in your house!!
Oh fuck
Because I think that's very wise
Ronald are you getting into the plumbing sector?
Is it not working for you on steam?
<@71716577669550080> now you have to play automata so you can be ready for whatever this is
http://gematsu.com/2017/09/square-enix-hiring-staff-nier-related-product-scenario-creation
It's for my grandpa who can only move half his body
It's very good and very similar to that great Skyrim mod I was telling you about
Also I just finished the time loop arc of TAZ
It's so dope the future is now

Look at what we got installed in our house
Guys
I have to get it now
Neko astsume is coming to psvr
Fuck
i think this album would go well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iokfQ5Bym2Y
Go to 20:15 on this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34UutDrXV2Q&t=306s
fuck yeah
thats some chaos magic shit
yes
yeah this is just horrifying
that would be unnerving
im actually kind of scared to try the eraserhead soundtrack
ok this one works pretty well but isnt exactly relaxing, more just intense https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ih7KzKLLWA
so this is where that over the garden wall episode coems from
so i cant use youtube doubler to test stuff
playback is diabled on other websites 😦
just so you know
keenan im now making it my lifes goal to find the perfect music for that video
His head is really heavy he needs to balance
Is the criteria just that you worked there long enough and you were fired?
Do it
And it's not because he only wants the best and brightest it's because there's no rhyme or reason to how things work and they're really bad at doing schedules and delegating resposibilities
The turnover rate here is ridiculous
But the fact that he has an infinite pool of educated people to hire makes him lazy
See javad clearly has a large degree of business savvy
That's what happens when you go to too many seminars on small business ownership created by hedge fund manager or something
So they have no good concept of what I actually do when I'm not on register and that I do whatever bullshit they need every day instead of what my responsibilities should be
Also him and and Sara never talk to each other and are terrible at managing employees
And javad has very poor object permanence
Because I work a bunch of night register shifts now, so when javad sees me it's usually standing on my phone because it's 8 pm and very slow
My bosses have started getting on me
Do you have something else lined up?
God Ron's such a bitch
It's a plan


Why is philistine a descriptor for someone who doesn't appreciate good art I never got that from the bible
Stay on Reddit, philistine
And here comes the philistines
Christ
'selfcest'
'ok grandpas, times up'
Seriously tho Keenan you need to watch that chopped episode it's so fucking funny
Ill upmeme
Post it on Tumblr and I'll rreblog for my 12 followers
You know I don't have a reddit account
'I don't think this pop-pops gonna get chopped'
I'm having a stroke this sounds like a mbmbam episode
I'm watching an all-grandpa episode of chopped with clara
Come hang
Tell her I said hi
You with somebody?
Nice
No I'm with Rachel and some of her friends
I could do that at home and have sex at the same time
So I'm just drinking beer and sitting hete
I can't get smashed cause I have to drive and I can't hear anyone
Upstairs
Why do people do this this is so boring
<@155893986605793281> I'm at a bar for the first time
I can't srry, maybe late tonight
https://streamable.com/9utzv
I thought he was immortal
Holy shit
To go with his Xbox?
Lol
<@71716577669550080> hang with us tonight
Philip is having none of everyones bullshit
And Bea dragon quest builders
Mac you can finally play doom
Yeah that one looks dope
But you can let me know for sure
I'm def interested in it but money is kinda tight cause I'm paying for school now and I've bought so much vidya shit already this year
Yea boi
Lol
The boy is famous

I like twin peaks but I hate jokes and especially cannot stand vacuum tubes
Hmm
Proud of u
Senran kagura
That looks like an ironic t-shirt someone on Tumblr would make
Polyamory mod
Fuck yes
Alongside sick noscope crop harvesting
I need my game with revolutionary real time cucking mechanics
:(
When the fuck is stardew valley multi coming out I want to get back into it but want to play it with others
Smooth as butter
Playerunknowns minecraft
Bullshit Minecraft runs great on xbox
Mac we know you have buyer's remorse stop trying to get us to buy xboxes
Fuck yeah
Yeah old cartridge boxes are great
I wish I still had my Kotor 2 box
I want a physical pc halflife2 as well
Yeah it looks like it just had a cardboard slipcase for some
Hmm I'm googling and you might be right
I'm pretty sure I saw cardboard box versions at Walmart and such
I'm actually sad I never got a physical copy of the orange box
And the orange box which had several interesting and diverse games for a very reasonable price
And the halo pc box which was the coolest thing ever
And the Oblivion manual which looked dope as hell but wasn't great about actually explaining the game mechanics
I remember Neverwinter nights came with a little spiral-bound manual that was essentially the entire fucking player's handbook in small font
There will never be anything as dope to receive and hold in my hands
I love those boxes tbh
Not even to play just for your shelf
You should start collecting those PC games with the giant cardboard boxes
Hey pal my steam library is alphabetized too you're not special
What would really make it tonally diverse would be if you bookended it with black ops 3 and FIFA
<3
Nah those all scream 'manchild' to me
I don't even care about any of the other mysteries I'm just glad to have that one resolved
THAT HE TALKS ABOUT IN THE QUINOA VIDEO
AND THE INSPIRATION FOR IT COMES FROM THAT TRIP LYNCH TOOK IN THE 60s
IT IS A FROGMOTH
A PRODUCER CONFIRMED IT IN AN AMA
KEENAN
!!!!!!!!
It's probably been awhile since he's seen american graffiti
Whys he have skin cancer
Whys Ron Howard at my door
Whys the bed so small
Bathtub*
Why doesn't this house have a bathroom
Whys the baby look like a prop from half life 2
How's the female character creator in fallout 4 worse than the one in skyrim
@everyone viudeo james?
Same :-)
And once fnatic was down he asked them to go with pieliedie instead
Lol apparently demon asked EE to try to come to fnatic with him
'guys should we pay someone to draw the mascot for our company?'

I can play lots in like half an hour
I feel like that's just a ersatz version of going to like iFunny or 9gag
<@71716577669550080> how do you feel about vgj.ritsu
Plus I'd have to get psn
I'd play with you but playing a game like that w controller sounds awful
Don't shittalk halo 3
Get gud enough and theyll be begging you to raid their destiny loot rare boss guns
Sick
Any girls?
Cool
Contract cancer and talk to the make a wish people maybe
Idk what your best approach is then
Hmm
And now I'm at work
And fuck you buddy I woke up at 8 drove to Indy and took two math quizzes in a row
Are the na servers split into regions
Yes
Lol yeah I found that recently
I think they said something about that when filling in people for awful squad
There's probably a polygon or something discord or twitch sub discord they use when they play w fans
Confusing show
So that raises the question of to what degree he and the arm are in league/what their relationship was then
He isn't but his arm is
I think he originated from Judy/was connected to judy but gained some independence
Hmm
Yeah Mike is still an enigma
Right but I think they may be different appearances of the same entity
I always thought he was connected to the jumping man
Idk about that
Yes, but I think that was given to her by the incel guy
But I don't think that name is mentioned in the actual original show
Right yeah they're obviously the same
In the trailer park
I think the chalfonts are only mentioned in fwwm
All interpretation is probably pretty retconny at this point lol
As with anything it's also possible that that just wasn't something they were thinking too much about in the original run
It's possible
Hmm
I think it might show that cooper/Richard asking what year it is at the end might be him realizing what's going on rather than pure confusion
I think that Mike asking 'is it future, or is it past' is really important
Hmm
Yah but her name isn't tremond
I think that two birds one stone was implying that cooper was making a move against Judy by trying to save Laura from that night
Possibly
Yeah Im struggling to interpret that
Naido was just Diane who Mr c didn't know had been freed but would have hurt if he found out
Because he knew the whole situation w Freddy and Andy was there
But when the fireman did the iPhone swipe he redirected him towards the sheriff station
No, see I think the coordinates were directing him towards the Palmer house
I think she was the voice on the phone when coop thought he was talking to Philip who said 'i will be with Bob again'
I think seeking out just was bad coops ultimate goal but I don't think he knew just why or what she was
Hmm maybe
That theory at least I think gives that stuff a more grounded place in what's going on and makes everything come together a little more
Some people have theorized that all the Audrey stuff and the weird Roadhouse scenes with new characters and little stories that didn't seem to connect to anything we're taking place in the Richard universe
That and the phone ringing made her house so tense
Like how freaky were those last 5 minutes
But I've come around to thinking that the finale was a really good fusion of their sensibilities
I think if it was just lynch it would have been so different that its hard to say
I can't tell your sincerity level
In that something has obviously changed and Diane is losing her sense of self/possibly being consumed by her doppelganger
I think it kind of explains it
Im still not sure that the Richard universe is orchestrated by the white lodge rather than Judy/Sarah, but j think it's clear the fireman had some foreknowledge of what would happen, and was thus able to help Cooper navigate the other world without being lost
<@155893986605793281> I think this is well written and getting close to the truth https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/6ybyjy/s3e18_my_finale_theory_that_offers_a_dianecooper/
I'm sad I was sick when he came to the bishop last year
He's dope
Yeah
And I'm never sad to see eg win but they're too mainstream
I think fnatic and ppd stack are gonna be my teams this year
Nice we finally have all the big rosters

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASdmYsbW-cY

he didnt like rupture or cold snap much either lol
he got dueled and was like "WTF IM STUNNED FOR 8 SECONDS THIS IS TOXIC"
some league streamer with 15k viewers is playing dota and getting really mad about it
yes
n
Or have interesting profiles
Which is only 4 cuz dudes on this app don't know how to take good selfies
I've matched w every dude I've liked so far lol
Didn't see you yet, I only downloaded it last night
So far nobody has gotten it :(
<3
Lol did you find my tinder
D E L I B E R A T E L Y
DOUGIE YOU DO THIS SHIT TO ME
<@155893986605793281> I just realized that the plot of the twin peaks finale will play out exactly like the seduction of Dr fugazi featuring Audrey Horne
god no
sure ill do 1 game
<@!240129712645603329> play with us
@everyone pubg?
<@!71716577669550080> pubg?
There's always action there
What we've started doing is just landing in the military base or power plant or something
happy birthday
too late
if i buy it for you will you play with us
complete our 4-man squad
Ben you should get into PUBG with us
wut
mac did you see fnatic confirmed tyhe ee/pld lineup?
I mean you dodged a bullet the black keys fuckin suck
Whoa
Lol
It should be Jesus in myth, tradition, history and your heart
Wow
That sounds dope
home
I get off at 10
I get off at 10
I get off at 10
I get off at 10
Lmao
They also have bouncers and drunk ppl that might try and fight you
Pregnant young women are probably far easier to intimidate that your average stripclub patron
Idk I think they're pretty gross but that doesn't sound like a super productive course of action
You mean protest the stripclubs?
Jai une ame solitaire
you can do that while you play stupid
tell her to speed it up
we knew it
R u playing DotA or some Nintendo shit
Cool
Mac we should try this reincarnation rpg custom game thing tonight
It's so gross
Try making a part or sketch
Look how ugly it is
I'm still in class
No just this creo program
Ew this software is so ugly and complicated
Goddamn it mac I'm not a cs student anymore
Don't I have to set.up.a remote desktop for that tho
O nice
Not this program
And it's not free so I gotta do all my homework for it here lol
It's a modelling program I have to use for this class
Have u ever used creo parametric?
Especially essays about an important engineering avhievement
I sure love writing essays
Oh boy got my first essay
Ew
My intro to engineering Prof is just Mrs frye but older
Is there still a law against jerking off in theatres?
Whenever a good time is for me to get either really wasted or stoned
Oh man I haven't been in a toysrus in like 12 years
I can't drive to GameStop I have class
Now it just says out of stock lol
This is ridiculous
Me neither
Did you get one?
Goddamn I wish I was on wifi
Well, thats a bummer
Out of stock :(
Schools the worst
I'm heading home now
Wow I can't believe you're playing pubg without me
How was yours
Which means I have to memorize a bunch of trig values and shit
Both my math classes don't actually collect homework but you're not allowed to use calculators on quizzes and tests
It was ok
Go stand in one and you'll find out
I'm not even good lol
Ronald I can when I get off work at 10
Age of empires iv is a thing now
:'(
The PC version of ffxv with all the 4k textures and shit is 170 gigs
I'm gonna stay outside for a bit on the off chance a portal to the black lodge opens
Calc was 15 minutes long because the Prof was in Nashville to watch the eclipse and everyone else wanted to leave to watch the eclipse
Ok I need to sleep now I have to drive to Indy in the morning
Yeah
So having the 4 as initatior is crucial
Teams need damage and offlane is becoming more of a core role
I think that because heroes are getting so tank/getting items that give tank or escape
Maybe
Because 4 is kind of the new offlane
Like all the best teams at ti were built around 4
I wonder if the new patch will change how important each respective role is
They just need good captains
Yeah, but that's kind of to be expected
It was great watching sg beat secret and almost eg
I hope that SA has a strong showing this competitive season
Reform mvp
Timado as mid lol
Maybe if moo goes back offlane
As carry?
Also where is poor aui going
Flee and stanking are both very legit
I wonder who freedom will get to replace him
Ccncs probably the best na mid not who wasnt on a top team yet
Yeah he's the weakest I think
Yeah I think that team has potential to be as good as dc at least
Didn't misery say he didn't want to captain anyway
Eh I mean it was fine when misery was on a team with puppey
But he's 9k so maybe he can shine, just depends on how well he and envy work together
I haven't seen anything from xcalibur after he was a fnatic standing that impressed me
Same with fnatic
I think ppds team is dependent on how well pajkatt and ccnc work together as a core duo
That guy also said secret is ace/midone/fata/yapzor/ppy
Also seems weird that ace is the best carry secret could get
There's a couple weird things like moonmeander playing 5 and fata playing 3
They all sound legit
Sounds interesting
Who won
We beat some medium bots pretty handily
sure
thats still not as good as the one where he dances to youre gonna go far kid
<@155893986605793281>
I can play
Lots of folks are saying OG rtz
For now just pay me by actually playing the game w us
Pay me*
I'll think of a way for you to payment the $20
but depending on how that goes i may still join you lol
Claras moving back tonight so ima go see her
theres going to be a new episode of Twin Peaks: The Return tomorrow at 8:30 pm est
guess what
oh yeah mac and i have very few bad habits
Let me watch creed real quick so i can do my best impression of what sylvester stallone sounds like in that movie
ok
yes
im pretty sure thats how rtz got good
our routine will be several hours of 1v1 mid drills and nothing else
ok
its better than the first one but im still not sure its actually fun
i got like halfway in adventure mode
so far its the same as the first one but in a ice setting

siltbreaker
I'll get it if they make it so the map doesnt talk to you

Lmao
Fine I'll bring u some
Hmm
Idk it seems easier to bring through TSA than loose weed but don't they have ways of checking for that?
Unless she asks why im giggling so much in which case I'll probably tell her because I'll be hi
Idk I don't plan on mentioning it
I asked for watermelon chews and she asked if I wanted regular or sour
Yeah frankly I was overwhelmed w variety
The drug store
<@127535721857679362> I bought us some edibles
I want to tour by segway
Holy shit
He's the weeabo player so I hope he appreciated it
I'm so happy

Tru
He wasn't doing physical signatures :(
Yeah us millennials being on our phones for a bit of the ~36 hours of DotA we are going to be here for this week
Mac found it confusing
We listened to mbmbam together on the planr
Thursday morning but he's going to be gone all afternoon
We got some real shitty burgers
Well I'm sure I could get that somewhere
Yea
There's the Side Shop which is like a reddit thing
Keenan I'm going to try and get my favorite player to sign my Miku backpack
There way a guy I thought was just a gay furry but then I realized he was doing a mk cosplay
Yep
2cute
I sold it for 95 dollars
<@!127535721857679362> i got a chest for witnessing first blood at the arena
his passive has an active during nighttime now

Truly we live in the darkest timeline

it wasnt the best draft either
i dont get it
fata and mss have been so bad this ti
why have envy teams been unable to get tehir shit together at ti since ti4

I have a sinking feeling about this because empire has 3 cores and also better teamfight
god envy pls dont choke
dope

thank u
thats what the calculator got
man online ways of cheating at math have gotten way more advanced since i was in hs
wow i found a calculator to do it for me
<@!71716577669550080>
The fuck do I do here

Is this right

at least i remember how to factor
but itd be easier to make sure im on the right track
lol im looking everything up
i havent taken a math class in 3 years
if this was multiple choice id be much happier
i dont actually hate math i just hate online free-response math tests
god i hate math
look at this smiling man
http://i.4cdn.org/tv/1502137898989.webm
ppd looks much less shiny than ususal
This is p nice
R liquid seriously getting alched twice in a row
Whys slacks look drugged
Lol
Mac I'm at work you need to live commentate it for me
<@!155893986605793281> apparently they aired episode 14 by accident in germany and its wild
fuck yeah
<@!71716577669550080> ok im ready
I might I need to look in how much it would cost to leave my car there

ye i might go depends on if im less tired than i am now
the ape harrelson film?
monkeys?
it airs at 8 npow
keenan they moved twin peaks up an hour
They announced dq builders 2 with multiplayer
give me like 15
sure
mac do you want to play something?
<@!155893986605793281> this is actual p cool https://i.redd.it/6h2m0ken1zdz.jpg
maybe this year it will be a SA team to knock out og
remember ti4 tiebreakers when newbee barely got through
yeah
dat vacuuuuum
i didnt like pajkatt at first and i still think hes the least interesting person there but theyre all doing a good job
the panel has grown on me
yeah but that was p bullshit balancewise
he doesnt seem great but i think hes much more interesting as a core than a support
im into this core monkey king thing teams are doing
the mental aspect is unlike any other hero
because hes not a good hero but he's still triggering af\
i think maybe he didnt want to add it before ti because he wants pros to have a long time to get used to the idea
nobody even makes complaint threads on reddit anymore
hes not a good pub hero at all
yeah im just not sure what if is waiting for
why is techies not in cm its been like 2 years
not counting techies since hes not in cm
Bane, Lion, Meepo, Spectre, Tiny, Wraith King
whats the last one
tiny, wraith, spectre?
what if hellraisers for their last game just drafted the four heroes that havent been picked too much
i mean i think as far as the event goes its not a good thing but i dont mind if it works out better
neither team drafts any stuns
envy bo1 nerves vs puppey bo1 retard drafts
damn
is that gonna be a bo1
<@!127535721857679362> monet has a 19 minute linkens+eblade in this game
ah fu is really good
i can def see lfy winning this tournament
and he can do that because theres nothing on the line for him so he doesnt have to feel defensive
like prophets just tping behind all of og and wrecking them
especially when you have heroes like nyx and prophet
i feel like when a team can do that it gives them a huge advantage
lfy is playing with absolute confidence in their rotations
lfy is destroying og
ok so hr is def out even if they 2-0 c9
They're probably out then
Shame for them 33 is really legit
Looks like hellraisers are gonna lose their game so things look good for c9
Pipe slark incoming
First Abba pick I believe
Thank christ
Why does he keep buying back
Midas into mjolnir into pipe
Classic envy
He's gonna scatter old Russian weaponry throughout key arena and then lock the doors
He's gonna be doing some research
Do you think he wears a hoodie and mask all the time in real life?
Good call
np
k
do you want to play pubg?
yeah
yeah i mean the mcelroys in particular kind of have an image to maintain so they're probably not gonna have anything to do with him after this
https://twitter.com/JustinMcElroy/status/893654090512826368
most damning besides griffins tweets is the other guy who does a podcast with him tweeting about how angry he was and that he was sorry if people felt they couldnt  come to him because he did a show with nick
yeah its pretty clear from what people have been tweeting that it wasnt some one-time incident and more a pattern of how he acts towards women in the industry
man i never was into him the way im into the mcelroy boys but thats so much mcelroy content i can no longer enjoy 😦
https://twitter.com/ali_west/status/893322058784006144
https://twitter.com/griffinmcelroy
i dont know any of the details but hes been suspended from polygon pending an investigation and griffin tweeted some p serious stuff
and just as i was going through cool games inc
Ugh theres some sort of sexual harassment drama going on concerning Nick Robinson
its actually not that interesting neither team can do anything
weaver aghs and oracle keeping igv in the game
103 minutes, megacrepps
empire vs igv
this game tho
Yeah sounds good just let me know when you head home
The only people who can play naga are notail and position 4 players
Neither has arteezy actually
Idk why they pick shit like naga for envy he hasn't had a good naga game in years
I hope c9 has a comeback today
I think removing minute 0 shrines is a lot of that
It also seems like we're getting out of the slump where mid is all that matters and carry either gets totally sacked or just does nothing for 40 minutes
I love metas where there's a lot of carry options
Basically all of the carries except spectre and gyro are getting a lot of play
Pugna position one is common
I'm loving the meta this ti
I can do tomorrow night if you're up to it
When your tonsils can handle it man its been killing me saving this last bowl
<@!155893986605793281> you and i are going to get high and go see jodorowkys holy mountain when it plays at the iu cinema
ok i should do work anyway
tell me when youre done
<@!71716577669550080>  do you want to do a couple games in the new fps mode?
ive thought about commuting, the biggest thing is that my grandparents are moving into my house so its time for me to move out anyway
im sorry guys i didnt mean for me bitching aabout school to cause a divide between us like this
Their reinstatement process is just super not geared towards transfer students/ppl who don't live in Indy
Yeah I think the next couple weeks are gonna be rough but then I'll be fine
But I'm extremely cynical about the whole process
I think I am
Yeah I should
Plus every time I get an email that says something like 'report to office of career counseling/financial aid/whatever my gut instinct is to buy a gun and disappear into the woods
Regardless it's time and money and logistics I gotta figure out
Yeah and iupui has  limited student housing and I'd be applying very late
And besides all that I gotta figure out moving to Indy and probably getting a new job
But tomorrow I have work in the morning and then have to drive back up to Indy for a career counselor meeting
And I gotta do a math placement test and a bunch of other shit before I can even schedule my next one, which I gotta do around my trip and the fact that classes start the 21st
And then work tonight
So I had to wake up at 8:30 this morning and drive to Indy for a 15 minute appointment
So my reinstatement thing for iupui got accepted but I have to do 2 advisor appointments before I can even sign up for classes
Best way to spend an evening

<@!71716577669550080> pubg?
I'm going to bring my old laptop because I might need to write some emails but it can't do much else
I mean if I messed up someone else at the store will probably have to deal with it
I hope I didn't mess any of them up
Just wrote about $2200 worth of checks
Fucking millennials
Because they've never been able to recapture the magic of pajama sam?
Why
Me except I never actually tell people I've been dreaming about them
Lmao
You think?
Yeah cause steam hasn't added fingerprint scanning yet
i mostly just guessed for heroes cause i have 0 idea
and fantasy teams for tomorrow closes then too
10 hrs
<@!71716577669550080> do you want to play pubg?
I need to make my dota predictions and then i can play
I wonder what the bts/nge major is gonna be
Damn
A little more tense
Yeah, I think it'd be fun though

http://www.cc.com/video-clips/meksx3/nathan-for-you-age-progression-specialist
and he sees how far he can get them to go with it
its this guy who theoretically has a show about helping small businesses but his ideas are really inconvenient and questionable

I watched a bunch with my parents and its not the kinda tv i usually enjoy but its so good
keenan have you watched Nathan For You?
shit
Here!
<@71716577669550080> it looks like all the Walmart preorders are getting cancelled :/

do you want to play dota
im hoping it makes me throw up something really gross in some sort of symbolic emetic catharsis
today i bought everything i need to make david lynch quinoa
i had no interest in it but i remembered that is has to end with the apes winning wehich is dope
interesting
yeah but i think once you put aside those rose colored glasses you can agree it would be better with anime girls
i will finally have a pleasurable gaming experience
now once i get this race mod working and replace the ingame radio entirely with vocaloid music

<@!155893986605793281> i found a fallout new vegas mod that replaces every single poster, billboard, player card and loading screen in the game with anime girls
thats a shitton of money too
yeah
its still no pokemon
i mean undertale was very successful for an indie game but i feel like how much it actually sold can seem a little exaggerated because the people who are into it create so much tangential media
which is a really, really popular game
advent children is a movie based on final fantasy seven
im not that surprised
man id been jamming out to this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dd4HqNOA4U song for like an hour before i looked up the lyrics and realized its about being bad at spinning around in circles
yeah sure
http://imgur.com/DdpP0SE


theyre so in lesbians
the camera even zooms in on it
im gonna cry
a concerned and tender shoulder squeeze
lapis gives peridot
Keenan
holy shit some steven universe previews from SDCC got leaked and they look so fucking good

Terrifying
no boots
miracle is currently playying shadowblade diffusal antimage
huh
thats probably what pyrion and tortelini are there for
i really hope its odpixel/synderen or od/merlini or something casting the finals
idk why valve doesnt like him
but yeah kotlguy would be great
sheever is ialmsot certainly not up to it
what happened to chobra
yeha machine hasnt impressed me
i think ccnc casted a lot at the summit fdl was at and then did one of the major hubs for bts
who cares what pajkatt has to say
at the very least he's somewhat relecant
no ccnc did analysis for some event
bulldog might be fun, ppd is into that kind of thing
idk what they have to offer
the ones that stand out to me are pajkatt and akke
no maut feelsgood
yeah kotl and lacoste were grinding out that coster/analyste synergy
at least nobody invites shaneomad anywhere anymore
yeah i like pyrion but he doesnt do anything dota related anymore
i shouldnt take naps becuase i was legitimately about to post something like 'the only way i can visualize ownership of things transferring is ants crawling from one part of my body to another'
I'm down
thats the best part tho
<@!155893986605793281> i want this shirt so bad https://68.media.tumblr.com/34cc00520cab9026c845ebcc51d28093/tumblr_oteq8buVqD1s7ji1wo1_1280.jpg
cloud nine must have offered them a pretty damn good contract
i guess
and i dont think he was losing money
he seemed pretty into the whole player-run thing
i wonder why envy did that
if they win ti im going to literally cum
wow they really went the distance to kick bone7
r u srs
i like it too
but i mean, both of those are at least basically ways of saying 'you're stupid'
i've gotten 'mong' and 'spastic' but no racial slurs
yes
can we avoid words like 'tranny'
<@!127535721857679362> as charming as your texts are
It really didn't matter :'(
I guess in the end
The lead singer of Linkin Park is dead
Fuck
Or they do an overwatch/hots type thing and the set is just the sniper from tf2
And when he wins the announcer yells 'TERRORISTS WIN'
All his voice lines are filtered through the cs go comm effect
That'd be dope
The arcana is just an awp but it's on fire
And a giant fiery skull will appear over whoever he assassinates
You just kniw if sniper wins it's gonna be 2 flaming guns
I think a ta arcana would be cool, and then maybe enchantress or dark seer
Yeah but they're also dope as hell
And I seriously doubt valve can make a cooler invoker set than the super rare one
Same with rubick
I just can't understand why anyone would be like 'maybe there's just not enough pudge shit to choose from'
All of them have expensive sets with lots of effects except sniper
I feel like I'm gonna naked lunch out and look in a mirror and I'll be an ant
There's fuckin ants everywhere

THEYRE ALL JUST SPEAKING SPANISH LIKE ITS NOTHING
but its in fucking spanish
ive never seen flubber
this is the funniest goddamn thing ive ever seen
oh fuck theres a seperate flubber thats in spanish
no youre right keenan ill just watch blue velvet
or the advbentures of tom sawyer
human centipede 2
evilbong 666
ok so my 3 choices are
love that film tho
im joking i would shit myself
antichrist is one of my favorite movies that the thought of makes me terrified
why havent we shown mac antichrist
should i watch antichrist high
hey quick question
cobble?
what the fuck was my element
who could have forseen trhis
wow
"No, I was the true fountain mother!
let my boy live"
ios this some wisdom of solomon shit
really milking the chicken on this one
one of us is having a lot of fun with this lil prank

Matt Mercer was the model for the main character of The Sculptor
sick
Oh fuck yes
I feel so validated
Wow r/games is having a overwatch discussion thread and everyone is saying they liked it a lot at first but got burned out due to shitty design decisions
And 'terlet' for 'toilet'
I just heard a woman say 'diabeetus' unironically
It wasn't popular but everyone online who's seen it liked it it seems
I think I'm the only person who didn't like that movie
According to his snapchat
He probably hangs out irl
And I really want to have a casual conversation with him
Because everyone who's ever worked with him says he's the sweetest and a really nice and straightforward guy
See I want to hang out with lynch so bad
No
God that intro is just the worst
Lol it took me way too long to figure out what you were talking about
When will lynch direct a couch gag
It's that or DENTAL PLAN
That two-parter might be my favorite ep actually
I'm also a big fan of the red room sequence in 'who shot mr burns'
I think it's a really good look at why his films work the way they do
It's David Foster Wallace's essay about visiting the set of lost highway but also just about lynchs work in general
You should read this
http://www.lynchnet.com/lh/lhpremiere.html
I'm sure if you saw it in theatres at the time it'd fuck you up tho
Blue velvets good but not mind-blowing the way Mulholland or even the best parts of twin peaks are
No, I need to see that and holy mountain
Well yeah but that's because jodorowskys vision is kind of outside the realm of what was possible at the time
He could have easily faded away if he hadn't persuaded delauentis to give him a small budget and creative control to make blue velvet
It was a big blow to his career
Everyone else hated dune too
Well yeah but to be fair
It's because of dune he has creative control of all his movies now
Lynch hates dune tho
Maybe he had some of mobius work from jodorowskys dune
I know lynch had some of gigers rough sketches to go on
Because Eraserhead came closer to gigers vision than a lot of his own work
Hr giger has said he was really sad he didn't get to work directly with lynch the way he was gonna with jodrowsky
It even stars Kyle McLachlan man
Lmao
the pillows r cute
i didnt i checked
did i not give u my bones
ty
got it
my whatnow
nothing
i didnt, but the server did crash the second i died
i dont

Brb gonna drown my sorrows in homophobia and Polynesian sauce
Oh fuck yes chick file a is still open
Yeah it turns out used markets are antithetical to capitalism
yeah
i mean how screwed up the economy of it is
oh yeah for sure
about just how screwed up the numbers are
i always struggle to explain the new games thing to people who ask about my time at GW
yyep

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7x6IBR8b98
I knew I recognized him from somewhere
I also just realized the redneck assassin guy who tells the girl to give Cooper a 'wet one' is the diner guy from pulp fiction
I'm not sure
Also I think if you try to donate it goes to the store page for the official soundtrack
It was registered in like 2015

its not on the checkout page but i can put it with my search

ok how do i apply this discount
yes
otherwise thaty would be a 3 hour flight
oh the 10 am is taking into account the time difference lol
if i want to get there an hour later i have to leave an hoiur earlier lol
i guess but leaving in the middle of the day is much more
without discount
total is 455
plane departs

Sometimes I watch the Russian cast because that's the only way I can engage Clara in it
It was in English tho
One time I was at bens house deathly sick, 1.5 hours into trying to record a podcast and clscreamong at DotA videos
No Keenan because that's just our lives
We can all build inside my cube
What if I turn our whole area into a cobblestone cube
Yeah these dumbass kids don't know how to alt tab to the wiki like us hardcore gamerz
Yeah tonight is when we'll make building plans and fix all the holes in the ground
It was basically all resource gathering
Ehhh
We were just so horny for it
Sorry keenan
ronald youre deafened and muted
ok im ready
I'll be on in 5
I'm on
I will
Mac when are you gonna be able to set spawn
idk but ben has all that shit set up and i dont
also we need to get ben on here so he can stream it on twitch and we can all make money
house
fuck
my
is
where
Where is it

im just walking around
im not doing anything
wow it is truly amazing playing with higher than minimum render distance
however it is playing some of the alpha music so it gets nostalgia points
this server sucks theres no minimap
they do own a copy of 'joy of sex' and some lube so they know whats what i guess
but i would hope so
i cant say ive ever thought about it much
have u seen my moms purple streaks yet?
i approve
but fictional blue haired girls are hot af
see i dont find blue haired girls that attractive irl unless its just highlights
and i need to decide which of these blue haired girls im going to (redacted)
im not super enamored with the gameplay yet but the world is really charming
who did u guys end up marrying in this game
It makes me want to go outside
<@!71716577669550080> dota?
'guys im so proud of you for meeting your diversity quato this quarter?
Who hired the autistic kid?
You're getting a raise'
Wow
Your mom and her friend sleep in the one bed
Is that a problem tho
Like in a really alternative state of mind?
Like psychically?
There it is
O fuk
ah, the ol' cougaroo
Send pics
I'm happy for u buddy
Thank u
Lol
Keenan please acknowledge my good joke
When you came, did you cry out 'AND REMEMBER, ITS GREAT TO BE A COUGAR'
She does have a good face
Was she noticeably better at sex than younger women
U fuck too hard?
Wow an io nerf
No just the natural gas company buying everyone's land and putting in big wells
And the girls aren't as pretty and there's way more opiate addicts
My grandparents live on a small farm near a dying community in one of the most beautiful parts of the country
The sad thing is tho
Not because its addictive but because it's basically exactly what I want my actual life to be
Mac I gotta be careful with this stardew valley game
It's pretty big fr our purposes tho
Well, we are there for romance, family fun, and business
Hell yeah
i think high dota is def easier than drunk dota but when you're high you dont care about it at all
Yeah idk what that could possibly mean
But I don't want that to be the only way I hang out with them so I'ma cool it for a bit
The last couple times I did it I did it with Ben Briggs and that was really fun
I'm almost out so idk if I'll try to buy more
I did it twice this one because I wasn't feeling great
I usually do it once a week before my sleep in day
Eh
I wouldnt pay much more than that for it but I really enjoyed it for what it is
I think it's still like $6
jazzpunk was really good high too
there was a long sequence where u just get blown around in a current with schools of fish that was orgasmic
like watching planet earth but better
10/10
also mac i played some abzu while i was high
very inconsiderate
people were setting off fireworks yesterday while i was just trying to smoke weed like a normal patriotic american
4th of july weekend and all that
i was about to kvetch about you not being here for twin peaks but then i remembered its off this week
nice man
dont watch it
nice
i i gg y
Who dat
<@!71716577669550080> dota?
And I don't bother to close it
Oh yeah it says I have Skyrim open when I accidentally open my mod manager
I'm just smarter about movies than anyone else
Duh
I know it's like yes I have cracked the code
Actually who am I kidding g this is what we sound like when we talk to Mac about twin peaks
I sincerely hope I'm never this nuts about anything
The shining conspiracy theory documentary
Keenan I'm watching room 237

Toes
Tiddies
Butts
Sex
Sec
Paintball is a safe space for both of those things
How great would that be
Holy shit all of us need to go paintballing asap
Yeah I know it just doesn't make me feel any better about my own crippling loneliness
Yep
I think she probably does lol
Yea
We all have our crosses
Its ok Mac I gotta wake up at 8 and work all day while my gf goes clubbing in tel aviv
Then I would just feel bad because I would look at her butt
Yeah damn she's really cute
Yeah I'm into it
And maybe a penis but that's negotiable
Good butts weird faces n short hair that's all I need
Wow no taste
She'd be way cuter with short hair tho
Her face is just weird enough
Thats the only girl you've posted I can picture myself making out with
Unlike all those other r crumb fans
Lina had his Kafka bio I meant to check it out
Nd by then you've started talking to them about r crumb and their panties are off
That's true
Yeah but they're probably taller than you
You have my permission to use photos of me to catfish them
Oi frig me clitty ya wee bairn
Until the second you imagine them talking in a Scottish accent
Is that they're all very attractive
Keenan the thing about these women
She looks like shes probably really boring irl
Ok that ones pretty good
Her face looks photoshopped onto her hair
U didn't pick a great pic to show us

Lgd.fy vs lgd
Unless it's like
Yeah I'm not going to to and then not watching the grand finals lol
Hmm that's considerably less interesting than I might have hoped
Wut
apparantly comewithme was on that squad too wow
yeah
now he is goin to ti
and people were talking about how his stream was a webcam pointed at the monitor
and there was a thread just titled TIMADO that was like hi im timado 4k playing with my dad
lol i remember i was going through the nadota forums a while back
its a bit shorter but i didnt explore all the levels fully yet
its pretty much a walking simulator but the fun stuff is pretty dense
6 bucks*
really fun game
you guys should get jazzpunk while its 5 bucks
I agree
I find it great that in a field with alliance, the old alliance players, synderens team etc a stack with thecoon and some old power rangers players are going to ti
Lop EU qualifiers
Knocked out by mid jakiro no less
Welp
If complexity knock odd out of these qualifiers it will be the ultimate fall from grace for odd

im watching a wild nothing performance and the lead singer looks a lot like ben
im into it
'imagine' being high
the effects team behind ep 8 has worked with french surrealist gaspar noe
interesting
what movie?
and now im inebriated so i feel even better than that
i skyped for awhile today so i feel a little better
it led to me snapping at clara which led to me feeling shitty monday whiich led to me feeling shitty the last 2 says
i've also been really depressed this week and idk if its correllated lol
i was emotionally fucked up for like 4 hours after we watched that
when i really want to fuck myself up
someday ill watch twin peaks the return episode 8 on these headphones
with my good headphones it sounds like the guy is playing in my living room and i can position everything
adventure times soundtrack is so good
god
i have no need for it but i still gotta try the HD650s
speaking of impulse buys i bought another sennheiser pair because it was at a really good price
i mean theyre still good headphones
i told you man
this is the best one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVpfHgC3ye0
the only true asmr is mildly asttractive women with slavic accents
ew
it takes time to get used to a new sound signatuyre
watch some good asmr with them
im glad
jack's face looks like a happy buddha statue
the only thing theyre missing is pro players to cast
everyone always reminisces about ti4 hub and stuff but this year has been pretty quality
WILDKIN GET YE AWAY
i think top 3 ti disqualifies you from being new blood
abed is for sure
but im always happy when new blood breaks out
yeah
navi with artstyle looked close to coming back but it didnt happen
complexity i categorize with navi in that something is just not working with those teams and switching around isnt going to fix that
dc is good but i really like the story of a newish stack of na also-rans powering through everyone else
they were such a great story at ti but they dont look hungry anymore
yeah i've been bummed at odd's falling off this whole season
every other team except sometimes np has been playing really sloppy
ill be fine with either dc or freedom taking this but i kind of want freedom just because their group run was so good
youre right
yeah but previous years they didnt have this groupstage qualification thing
they cant manage one for the majors but they can for the qualifier
jesus christ theres a lower bracket for this?
id have to narrow it down
then my question would be really vague
how is this odd dc series still going on
Weaver 2 rapiras
apparantly the na tiebreaker for 5/6 place went 1-1-1 so they have to do a second one today lol
yeah ill play then
aiight
when did he say he's deciding by
ok
ill play a game but i want to buy these plane tickets first can you get in voice?
pieliedie solo killing gyro at the end lol
lol that fucking game
yeah its p tense
They just destroyed dc
Mac how will you feel if ccnc directly qualifies to ti

nice
And dkc2 is on the 3ds eshop
You can borrow my chrono trigger for ds
I will
Oh fuck yes thats such a good game list
Not fully sure *
So we can just give them the tickets and we all split living expenses?
So Keenan's coming for the week maybe and Ronald's coming for the weekend?
Yeah so im fully sure i parsed all that
Because I'm not sure how else it would continue to function
So I assume the store is closing now
Good for him
Oh nice
?
Keenan I forgot to ask why is Eric leaving gw?
Wow I go to bed once and this happens
i have to go to bed but i can play plenty this week
The imagery is just so primevally powerful
That episode really fucked with me
Its a cache from before tonight and apparently its the only relevant google result for that poem
<@155893986605793281> scroll down to the very end of this page http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:IJEZP8-WjPsJ:www.commercialsihate.com/any-old-songs-that-you-cant-forget_topic24552_page5.html+&cd=5&hl=fr&ct=clnk&gl=us
amazon likes to compete when other sites have sales
they normally sit at about 80-90
thats fair
why
will you play with me
i might just come at 7 actually im more bored than i thought
then im somewhere else for you
unless you ever try to make me watch glee
you know im here for you
ok
do you want me to come sooner buddy i can if you need an excuse to stop watching glee
glee is really one of those things where time has vindicated the haters
both are probably true
are you depressed because glee is depressing or because the situation is depressing
it took me a while to parse that one
oh
what
especially open headphones like those ones
good headphones changes the fuckin asmr game its amazing
or are you being ironic
do you do that too?
I thought i brought this up and i was the only one of my friends that did that
they will probably just have higher fidelity and sound nicer
they will sound more spacy and more like a 3d sound space that u are used to which is good for gaming
they have a detachable cable so you can replace it if it breaks
they are comfy
OK I'll prolly come at 8
Are we peaking tonight
Cool
I mean they're v good for day to day life just that specific scenario might not be best
Lol im sure they haven't shipped it yet, it prolly lets you cancel
Mm Keenan those might not be the best for plane rides
the deal only lasts another 10 hours tho
these are on sale for $50 and theyre almost definitely the best deal you're going to get in that price range

The point is that I'm going to sleep I have spent the past 6 hours very happily drunk but now I go off to dream of cute girls who are into lapis lazuli
He's very open when he drinks so I know maybe a little more about his sexual proclivities than I would desire but thats also besides the point
But thats unrelated
Maybe
Well
Not as such
I doubt it
The truth is much stranger but I won't divulge it here
I'm using protection
About me and someone else's floor
Lol Mac you don't even know
I'm on a camping pad I brought
It was a good time
I drank a good amount for the first time in awhile
And lina and her bf are in it
Its 2 boys 1 trans boy and 1 girl because their house only has one bed
No
I had a good convo with him and this other 35 year old about twin peaks
He's chill
Lina's boyfriends house
I am currently sleeping on a floor perpendicular to andy maben
My list of male friends I'd sleep with is surprisingly short
I just hate most men by default and have problems not being flirty w women
I'm really hoping if I end up going to iupui I can make meaningful platonic friends
I do too tbh I need more friends than you Ben other Ben and Bailey
I had forgotten what meeting people is like
Man I had a really long and wonderful talk about Steven universe and undertale with this girl tonight
And every paragraph has a new florid simile
Its very inspired by Umberto eco but written by one of those guys who jerks off to the power of literature
And also its kind of bad
Tho to be fair she didn't buy it for me
Its OK I'm still working though Clara's favorite book
Yeah I remember when you took it on a trip but spent the whole time playing a 3ds game I lent you a couple months before
Me neither
Have you read Neil gaimans Norse myth yet?
Yeah that sounds dope
Revenge is kinda Tolkien but it always ends in grief thats kinda the point
Yeah i like the lore but thats because its tied to a fundamental theme of the passage of time and sorrow and changing of the world
I feel like Sam and I probably like lotr for different reasons
Also I think I love lotr too much to play shadow of mordor
I bought wolfenstein but it doesn't fucking work on amd cards
Keenan I'm at linas birthday and I'm having a fucking blast because everyone's as much or more socially awkward than me
I'm drunk at a birthday party
Are you playing xenoblade?
that am had a 28 minute bf
36
I'm batman
Ew preacher is on Hulu Keenan should I watch it?

And if you can stretch your budget a little https://www.amazon.com/Technica-AUD-ATHAD500X-Audiophile-Headphones/dp/B009S333U4 will be the most comfortable thing you ever put on your head and great for gaming, they leak sound though so not ideal if you work like right next to someone

<@!71716577669550080> <@!127535721857679362> i can play dota if anyone wants
Is there something going on today downtown is crazy busy
Mac if you get nier make sure to get the FAR mod it fixes widescreen apparently
I'd contribute funds if it was more of us
Yeah but I can play alone for free
God I want to play Minecraft
Are there any fun coop games we can get into
Oh yeah do it
?
Nice
<@!127535721857679362> come
has it been 15 minutes
<@!127535721857679362> wbu?
<@!71716577669550080> dota?
No
Also have you even beaten earthbound
Is majora like mahjongg
Do you have some sort of design document or something
Sure
How can I profit off this
What kind of game is it
damn he got mad pecs in that picture
I just dropped off Tucker at soccer and was gonna ask to hang but he just called to say it's goalie only night lol
Wait nvm
<@155893986605793281> are you at home
Yeah I know I'd still get antsy about that lol
Lacking
Like cmon someone beat my stupid game already
I'd get really bored and feel like I was packing closure
<@!71716577669550080> ok lets play
ok ill play in like 25
<@!71716577669550080> do you want to play dota tonight
I'm listening to my bro play overwatch and he's nonstop pma voice chatting and making calls
that sounds fun
oh you told me you couldnt play i assumed it was still up
<@!71716577669550080> hows the server going?
<@155893986605793281> I just got home, I'll prolly be there at 9:30 if that's cool
If I did you would have been freaking out more
Nah but I read the avclub review tbh I figured I hadn't missed much
I might pass out halfway through the ep but I'll be there
Yeah I'm probably gonna be home by around 8:30
<@155893986605793281> you twin peaksin tonight?
He smol
Keenan I'm gonna have a pickup truck next year let's get into jumping in the truck heading down to the range and drinking sweet tea
God shooting guns is so much fun tbh
About damn time tbh
I only have my phone
Send you a screenshot of what
Windows defender is useless but I doubt you do enough on that comp to warrant something g better/faster
You can turn a lot of that off
Also check what your comp has set to automatically start when you boot
Shit like your antivirus will calm down
Better computers do it faster
It's almost completed one cpu cycle
<3
Lol I'm just joking and tipsy
That's the real.monitkr
Keenan click on your monitor
There's alwayss some system process bullshit that runs when you first boot
Control alt delete
Task manager
www.lemmeputaramstickinyou.xxx
www.howmuchramdoihave.gov
Also apparently beyond has chunk claiming and a built in server leaderboard?
That's p cool
What are the rules
That'll be really nice
I'm pretty sure ic has teleporters
I don't have a laptop and the WiFi here only works half the time
U guys are making me so jealous
Ugh I kinda want to preorder the Undertale collectors edition for ps4
Do you have a server up?
Yeah it kept crashing on my i5 16gb ram setup and I wasn't sure why until I did that
Yeah
In the launcher preferences (the curse launcher not the mc launcher) there's a setting
Make sure you have 64 bit Java and assign like 4 gigs to the process in the launcher
Yeah it has thermal expansion which is like a replacement for bc
Somewhat
Yeah I think beyond might be best because it's at least someone documented
The original packaging was for this Skyblock type challenge where you had to use tech to make all sorts of esoteric materials to feed a machine
A platform for modpacks
If we're doing ftb you just press a button
It lets you automate all the cool industrialcraft stuff
Nothing makes me happier than huge pipe and machine networks
I love pipes
And something like buildcraft which is my favorite
Also a shitton of magic mods
I know the main ftb pack has industrialcraft and I think it has harvestcraft or something similar
And making sure stuff like block IDs work together is a huge hassle manually
Yeah but there's plenty more cool mods
And they get a ton of mods to work together
And they get a ton of mods to work together
They're more recent than tekkit
They're more recent than tekkit
Mac I think you should check out the feed the beast packs
So is this when he gets cut off by an epic blast of music and Todd Howard comes out and announces Morrowind 4
Did they announce Skyrim 2 yet
Srry
I'm easily spooked
Eh it'd be real slow and I'm not sure I want to watch it alone on my phone lol
Ugh I wanna watch
Not living up to my sextential
Ugh that was def not my best sexing
Like we all have sex with someone and they rate us
Guys we need to poll independent third parties on this
It's so fucking good
Ive been reading it on the trip I'm almost done
Keenan, have you read Nausicaa of the valley of the wind?
I can't remember
Ok
Why is Ronald first on religion
Mac are you gonna do a ftb server or some custom thing?
I'll miss all the fresh server fun
Also y u gotta start the server the week I'm away
I want to argue that I'm better at sex than Keenan but a) I have no way of proving that and b) I'd rather not know if I'm wrong
Was twin peaks good
Jesus I'm gone for one day and this happens
mac you'd appreciate this cooking video
https://boba-ferret.tumblr.com/post/161658665869/adulthoodisokay-oh-my-god-this-vid-from-a-ck
and like is chris martin just pulling words out of a hat now
"I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list"
and it goes
theres a new coldplay song thats been on the radio a lot
Yeah things really arent ever going to get better as far as cultural icons dying goes
Now they have to cancel family guy
Fuck
I better have fun if I'm gonna miss 2 sundays
Thank u
I'ma drop planet Earth off at gw for you
Ok
<@155893986605793281> are you at home or work?
Is the gameplay chasing down and running over millennials?
and the xbox is less popular
yeah and the ps4 pro is kind of a flop
like 3 of which are indie game levels of graphics
all those first party microsoft games
yeah
i doubt it will run most multiplats at 4k
its not gonna run every game 4k
i feel like at some point people who want enthusiast graphics at that level and people who dont want a gaming computer becomes a vbery small overlap
like there is literally no concievable reason to own one
the scorpio is gonna flop hard right?
<@!127535721857679362> do you want to play dota?
ok
<@!71716577669550080>  pussybreaker?

I'm coming soon
Mac you gotta wait till I get home to do this
SLITSMASHER
Yeah but deep strange journey and radiant historia areremakes and etrian Odyssey 5 has been out for awhile in japan
That was the removal that pissed me off most
I wonder what the number of people who played halo splitscreen was
But it's 45 gigs lol
Battleborn is f2p now
No doubt
We all thought of you
The latest twin peaks had a couple scenes of fingerprint forensics
I didn't know Xbox one had more than 12 games
It pretty depressing honestly
Man all of valves top writers have left in like the past year
He changes it back right away
here i go again, modding the shit out of morrowind knowing it will ultimately be a dissapointment
<@!71716577669550080> u good?
<@!71716577669550080>
@zeldo dota?
Cool
Yeah I'll come get it sometime this week thanks
Yeah you have so few ways of playing gen 2 lol
So I'm hearing you all got baited
<@!71716577669550080> dota?
What's sov
updated my facebook cover picture
<@155893986605793281> I'm at Kroger to you want me to bring any snacks?
8-8:30
Well I can cross having sex on an elementary school playground off the ol list
Hes going to enchant it with the optimal strength
You dumbfuck have you never played minecraft
For digging
What are the shovels for
We'll finally learn the answer to the question on everyone's mind
Yeah
Cause I'm pumped too
Is that me
I came late but managed to find a space someone left
There were cars on every inch of grass lol
Barely
I think our graduation was the last one there before it started
Assembly Hall has been under construction for a couple years
Yeah
It was funny seeing all those people in fancy robes in the absolute shithole that is the north gym
I said hi to phillip
Oh yeah I heard briles get called and wondered if it was a relationship
Wow that sounds even more depressing
High school is depressing
Went to tates graduation this morning
proud of you buddy
also <@!127535721857679362> im down to play whenever if you want to
i think i finally got clara into mbmbam
yikes
How old is she?
Congratulations
prolly
yeah monday porlly works
<@!240129712645603329> when we playing divinity yo
<@!71716577669550080> ok im ready
I can play in an hour or 2 my grandparents are here but they go to sleep pretty early
theres like 1000 people named mango nowadays
yeah give me 15
its hard to get a sense of how popular mbmbam actually is
how did griffin get named as a 30 under 30?
lol
he went to school in north carolina interesting
eh 6 years
because the laura palmer story is compelling enough that it would be impossible to not be dissapointed if they just kinda shaggy dogged along like they were planning
i think it fits the original idea for the show which was that it was really about these weird people and this weird space almost better than the original premise
yeah and theres less tension because we know where cooper was all this time
theyre more spaces to explore themes than macguffins that drive the plot
I think all the mysteries of the show are good in that theres less room for dissapointment than 'who killed laura palmer'
in terms of pure aesthetics I think that sequence is my favorite thing lynch has ever done
all i want to learn about is Mother
but theres obvious elements from both in the show
like frost wrote the secret history and lynch did FWWM and they didnt collaborate at all on those
I really like that they seem to have taken as canon stuff about twin peaks both lynch and frost did without the input of the other
but they have so many places to go within that and so many interesting tidbits to explore
I feel like we have a sort of central conflict/goal now with cooper vs.
cooper
yeah
yeah
I feel like the first 4 episodes have packed as much in as the entire first season
yeah man 18 is so many
is this what it was like watching tv for old people?
yes
can you believe this is gonna last until september
or baffling
yeah man its gonna be good
yeah the clips ive seen hav ebeen good
and?
i want to play nintendo fun time driving
*vore*

madchen amick is doing a tumblr ama
my ps4 has like 2 non-disc games installed and its already runnign out of space
FIFTY FUCKIN GIGS AND THATS JUST THE INSTALLER BITCH
Idk what that is but it looks cool
I've always been by far the warmest one in my relationships so idk that feel
If we have a good big/little spoon that's good, if we physically cannot simultaneously spoon and kiss that's bad
Like if I can pick her up during sex that's good, if I can pick her up with little effort that's just weird
Yeah but consider that 'significantly shorter' is a much bigger distance for me than for you
I feel like there's a bell curve for smallness where for someone my size the sex possibilities and cuddling compatibility get real good and then rel weird very fast
Yeah that's probably near my limit for how short a person I'd date
Damn how small was this girl
Interesting
Keenan how tall would be too tall for you to date someone
Lmao
mac you missed one hell of an elder titan game from np
flintstones
im not gonna lie every time i read anything from that new strip i feel like i've finally realized that sometime ironic and witty comedy can be really fucking stupid
i know but you know what i mean
im waiting every day for cuck to penetrate so far into irony that it suddenly becomes mainstream and we have some fox sitcom about cucking
notch is sad he doesnt have a gf because it means he cant get cucked
i think if theres anything we know about notch its that he wouldnt be into that
i want there to be more than 1 degree of seperation between my girlfriends vagina and Notch thank u very much
idk about all that i think it does pretty much what she needs it to do already
because its made of glass
Casper
lol
whats the blenders name
i got clara a dildo but it came with a name and now we have to call the dildo the name and its a little more whimsical that i think i intended when i made that purchase
"hello austin...
we only have one question for you...why are you here and not watching twin peaks, please leave so we can watch twin peaks"
i loved the live texas episode
hell yea
we're not but we could be
i mean whats the competition

U can't make this up
The big book of hacks for minecrafts classified tips other guides won't teach you
There's a whole shelf of Minecraft guides
Theres more than onr
Mac
They have an unauthorized guide to pokemon go
Guide to Minecraft advanced combat
This has gone too far

Either that or I was just really high but also gave myself a stomach or headache
I finally got too high
Keenan I finally did it last night
my dad has a full armor suit for riding his motorcyle it really counteracts the cool factor
i rode without a helmet until i broke my collarbone
There some fucking incredible footage of these marine iguanas that have to run a gauntlet of snakes to get to the sea after they hatch
Yeah man
Its so fucking good
I'm watching planet earth 2
Aren't they like 80 new
Keenan what species was Kraven again?
Did you see the guy who figured out that the sound playing over the gramophone in the black and white scene in episode 1 is the slot machine lever noise slowed down
Lmao
Ugh why do we need to wait another week for twin peaks
So should I buy my ticket through southwest?
What's the best way to keep an eye on sales?
aui brew
pieliedie batrider

sand king one is great too
nah i think that one stands out
i think the veno one is the best
i really dont like the enigma set
i got invoker gyro brew kunkka

you'd like these sets keenan theyre all sea monsters
sk is cool
hydra veno is cool as shit
pirate undying is pretty cool

gotta love jrpgs
you better have packed your lunch you little fuck

no im going to bed now im too happy to let dota ruin it
that has to be a big morale boost knocking puppey out of a tournament
my boys
fuck yes
the legendary dickface
my boy fata
there we go
yeah but it took them 40 minutes and by then luna and nyx and invoker were just too farmed
np won early game hard and just couldnt push high ground against invoker
it was really boring tbh
naomi watt's natural british voice is the weirdest thing
im sure
fucking high ground
i cant believe np lost that
why is this game so long
my new favorite thing is prois using the chat soundbytes
np better win this shit
we playin bish?
Is there context for this
God autistic kids are just the funniest
like looking at this game fata has twice anas cs but ana will farm stacks and have highest net worth by 25 minutes because thats how dota works
itll just make me angry
no
can u hear me
https://i.redd.it/92rksu82lazy.jpg
Ended up going to sleep at like 7:30 lol
I think ima sit this one out, I'm crazy tired.
Thanks tho, have fun

Idk
Also if Phillips not there we should def only watch the first two
We'll see how we're feeling
Cool
U should double check that keenan
O yeah Keenan my coworker is almost def coming
Mac r u watching twin peaks with us?
U don't have a Snapchat and you've never played silent hill

Sounds hot as fuck tbh
I'm glad I didnt lock up my bike outside
This building is going to collapse
It is literally just raining in one of the store aisles
I'm still weed hungover this is 2 much
Jesus fuck it is storming
Him and the two ppl who do the Steven ost are really talented
And the AT background music is pretty crazy
I also noticed last might that the background music felt a lot more prominent
They had some Japanese guest animator for that ep
I love how it just comes out of nowhere
Yeah
https://youtu.be/pnilc-izyKM
https://youtu.be/LkGPGS1FzYE
I also watched the king worm episode and I had to keep pausing it and rewinding to make sure u wasn't hallucinating
I need to rewatch it sober just to see if its actually real
It's the craziest thing ive ever seen
Keenan have u seen the food chain episode of adventure time?
she a qt
<@!155893986605793281> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vftf8TTve4s
Give me 15
Fair enough
But you should wait till the last moment so you dont spend more than you have to
Yes
He went back and remastered and edited them all
So the blue ray collection has 90 minutes of deleted scenes from that movie
Lol
I think she sold the pink room scene better than Lara Flynn Boyle could have tho
I liked movie donna
Because she was dating kyle McLachlan and got jealous
I think I told you but she was the real reason cooper and Audrey weren't a thing
She was doing other things
And then she ended up giving one of the best performances in a horror movie ever
Sheryll Lee was just hired to play a corpse and take a photo
In case the show wasn't picked up they made a TV movie version of the pilot where BOB comes out of nowhere at the end and mike shoots him
They even filmed a fake scene where Ben Horne is the killer
And it was kept a secret from everyone in the cast until that episode
After
It also had probably the most scary and brutal shit ever aired on TV at that point
X files, lost
It basically set the stage for every 'weird' show that came after it
Watch that video
Here Mac see what you think of this https://youtu.be/guwl1w0yFGk
I think its going to be accessible to new audiences
Its more of a reboot tbh
Yeah Mac you should watch the premiere with us
apparently a girl who had never seen the show had to leave last night because of the sexual violence
Its more like lost before there was lost
yeah thats a good idea
yeah idk how we leverage this tenuous connection
yeah i have a login
discord is a good idea
https://streamable.com/7t23
idk where else we should look
does iu have a craigslist equivalent
we should try and find someone in the next week or 2 and if that doesnt pan out just go by ourselves
we do
yeah
<@71716577669550080> IO ARCANA
<@!71716577669550080> dota?

like im just gonna absolutely lose it
i spent no joke 2 hours this morning thinking about how lapis and peridot are going to be in a dire situation, realize they have each other, share a tender kiss and then fuse and i'm going to die and go to heaven
WE ARE GONNA STAY LIKE THIS FOREVER
BECAUSE YOURE NOT GONNA STOP WHAT WE MADE TOGETHER
im cry
"Oh Steven.
We already love you."
"Well, did I make a good first impression?"
"Oh, I'm sorry.
We didnt want you meeting us like this"
"you're a fusion??"

She's the cutest ive seen

https://www.massdrop.com/buy/akg-k553-pro-studio-headphone
Yeah they're p good especially if you're using them for portable listening
The wired version is actually on sale on massdrop for like 99 which is pretty good
Keenan you should get the headphones these r based on

<@!71716577669550080>
@zeldo do you want to play dota

'holiday movie'
ugh ryuuborez is my least favorite caster
poor lad
keenan what kind of bike lock did u get when urs got stolen
this prey game looks cooler than i was expecting
this episode is a youtube poop before there were youtube poops
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov8_UhDPHqM
Hell yess
Alice is crazy strong if you downfuse her right
What*
KeenN why did u choose?
thats what a level 15 demon?
nice

<@!71716577669550080> <@!127535721857679362> i can play dota anytime if yall want to
Noice
I'm pretty sure the way they've advertised it is Archie but twin peaks
Because it sounds like the most batshit stupid thing ive ever heard
Keenan have you read anything about this Riverdale show
You two are so cute
i wasnt even looking for one but who could pass it up at those prices
I just bought a $15 lockpick set on massdrop
lmao
why didnt she like it
hmm u got like 5-10 left
we all bet and had better towers
is that why we lost that first game
ok
nice my guy
Lol
I thought the notail/misery incarnation was gonna be better but notail sucked on that team
Also probably the strongest past c9 roster
Fata is a god
Such a good roster
FUCK YES
http://www.siliconera.com/2017/05/04/nier-automata-collaborates-dollfie-dream-bring-premium-2b-9s-dolls/ fuck yes
like self-harm?
Good luck
afterwards did he put his hands on his hips and go 'oh you'
i can just picture philip saying that
lol
you were there for me when i was a mess
yeah np
and just thinking about doing all those steps over again is a nightmare
also its really nice to have a gf even when shit like this comes up
:/
i don't think you'd be a bad guy at all for doing that
but its better than the alternative
yeah because you're intensely charismatic, which is only partially your fault
because it'll just get harder
yeah idk i feel like i don't have that good a grasp on the situation but i'd say you should seriously evaluate what the cost of going too much further with hannah would be
lmao
also megan is v attractive
i'm glad you are still in touch and can have good convos
that's awesome
I feel like i'd get along p well with her
that's good!
or month i should say
yeah i guess also the first few months of you and megan i was barely talking to you
and i felt like i noticed it a lot more with you around new years and stuff
i def only became comfortable with it bc of clara
interesting
do you think you're more physically intimate w her around other people than you were w megan
a question
i was about to say lol i dont really know that they just talk about jazz which makes me assume they are
also i feel like you've got a weird thing going now where she's pals w philip and sam so that makes things even harder
that's a little shitty of her tbh
ugh
and that sucks, im sorry
i've felt that in the past to some degree
as it is im just more flirty than i think i should be and i can get away with it
i think if i was a different person socially it would be more of a problem for me
the perils of being a good looking male
i was just way too physically attracted to her lol
yeah i sometimes think me and laura would have been better as friends
because i feel like thats what should define a relationship as opposed to like a deep friendship
like that was my turning point w my relationship when i realized that despite our differences im more comfortable around her than like anyone before
comfort is so so important
yeah yikes
that's not great
huh
like physically?
i think the emotional/spiritual aspect of things is where me and her are most different
i kinda feel like that sometimes
yes
that's fair
because for the first like year of being w clara i just always had this deep feeling of 'its not gonna work this isnt going to last'
i know how it is to feel like it just isnt meant to be
hmmm
with the commitment stuff do you feel like you couldnt be with her for a long time because of her, or just commitment issues in general?
yeah
yeah man that would be a whole new thing if i was still dating laura and working full time yikes i'd feel weird buying her stuff or offering to help with things
its a weird thing to think about
and clara comes from a decently wealthy backround (def higher than mine)
laura was like that
how r u and hannah doing?
lol
but yet i feel i could thrive in something different
i was nearly a hermit for a summer because i got broken up with ive never had to deal with real  shit lol
yeah and also its hard to think about whether adversity and struggle would give me meaning or kill me
lol
and the thought that i could just live my life just seeking things that distract me from that is not great
because like i dont just think the world is shit i think its on a precipice of becoming way worse
which i think is bad for many many reasons
because i think in latestage capitalism it can be kind of encouraging complicitness
the worthiness of making people a bit happier in their situation vs an 'opiate of the masses' type thing
yeah thats one of the things im trying to figure out
i dont shut down as bad as i did before antidepressants but its still something i wish i could control more
which is super sensitive
but i feel a lot of weird animosity towards ppl based on my own mood
like im rarely straight up a dick
i feel like im at this weird place where i feel all this stuff for ppl ive never met but in person its like 50/50
yeah
well thats the thing i dont want it to feed on me but i also feel that existing in american society is being very complicit
yeah
and also im like crazy empathetic so i just feel bad about too many things
which i desire for myself and otehrs
i think for me its connected to a belief that there must be a more fulfilling and authentic way of living
which i understand but would be hard for me
i think that's how clara feels about things
yeah see for me its kinda like that personally but careerwise id feel so bad if i didnt feel i was doing something that could help ppl substantially
because it keeps me from thinking about substantial things
yeah i came to the realization that i now play video games for emotional rather than mental escapism
also like 90% of my early desire to write was based around escapism and im trying to come to terms with how i feel about the relationship between escapism and moral living
yyep
yeah i read like 2 a week in high school
but at some point engaging with a book emotionally became way more difficult and thinking about the personal stuff needed to actually make one just seems daunting
and to some degree i still do
see i used to feel that way about books
right with headphones i can bathe in the endless discussions of which is better and actually obtaining anything is kinda just the carrot
it is *zizek voice* pure ideology
yeah for me its all the research
yeah
add
that can ass up real quick
yeah sometimes im glad im not as into guitar as i used to be
https://images.monoprice.com/productlargeimages/160501.jpg
yeah i had to control myself because for a hot sec i considered getting into record collecting and i could see that just ruining me
its just so appealing!
http://hk.on.cc/hk/bkn/cnt/lifestyle/20140905/photo/bkn-20140905130310676-0905_00982_001_01p.jpg?143339
yeah
also i remember how thomas finn spent avery single day of ap english 11 on sneaker websites
cars
idk everytime i feel bad about spending on my hobbies (which i should def spend less on) i remember that normal people are into like
rein it in there buddy
because they'd hog your n64?
'i should get more'
just today i was thinking 'hmm i have many pairs of headphones, one pair of which cost $200, and a speaker setup'
its such a rush
lol

I still need to play the beginners guide
I kinda want to try vaping it it seems like it would be smoother
Last day is August 12
You should come get high with us and watch dota
Yeah I'm def planning to smoke in seattle
I smoked like 3/4 of a bowl
General sense of well being and u focus on things differently
It's fun
Yes I'm still kinda high
Also adventure Time is great ofc
Keenan I understand it now aqua teen hunger force is hilarious when you're stoned
I would say this is the first time I got truly high
Whew
Yeah
Yeah maybe, the final few bosses are pretty hard tho
You can also be crafty about the specific demons you fuse to make sure the final demon has a good skillset
It's p complicated but you get the hang of it
For the complex fusions you don't have to have them all in your party or stock you just have to have had them at some point in time
The game has pretty good tools for searching through your compendium for specific types of demons you've had or met before and you can summon them with macca for fusing
Yyep
This was invaluable when I was doing the complex fusions
https://aqiu384.github.io/smt4a-tool/
You can fuse down as well as up
Yes
Remind me is the merkaba fight after you go through the camp with all the portals
Which will be my only solace
Once Clara leaves I'll have a lot more Vidya time
I'm gonna
And I heard there were stealth sections which sounds bad
I just hate how they keep making me do stuff that's not flying
Yeah
It's super fun and I love the aesthetic but the pacing is awful
Yeah I still haven't beaten the second tbh
See I need to decide if I want to get into ffiv with you or teso with ben
I have it on pc
It's like if counterstrike ever progressed as a game and don't have crazy recoil
Yeah it's so cool
Keenan I'll get into ffiv if you get into R6 siege w me
I'll get it this summer once i clear out my backlog a bit
Srry I was too busy coming
I can play DotA later tonight
<@!71716577669550080>
I'm still so disappointed that didn't have multiplayer
Fuck that I'm sticking with Garfield kart
Is it on steam?
Maybe later
Yes
Kewl
It's a dollar
Do u want it

Defensive supports and supercarry
But that was pretty much a miracle era strat

Are you fucking kidding me I hate og so much
If og win this shit
Lmao
??
God damnit eg
they deserve it
ok i want sg to win this game 3
HOLY SHIT
FUCK
FUCK
holy fuck that black hole
Dark seer might be my favorite hero to watch in pro games
No I like eg
If anyone eliminates eg this tourney I want it to be sg
I just hate watching them play
I mean they are clearly one of the best teams of all time and I think fly is an incredible captain
Let it flow through you
I see you are finally coming around to the og hate
I'm at work
lol
I did
Maybe much later I'm having dinner with ben
Perfect groupstage get knocked out by lowest seed
Holy shit the most secret thing of all time
I'm getting called to do like 3 things at once rn but I'll pm you later
And there really not a lot you can do about it
Ah shit man that sucks
I'm at work too until 630
Call me tonight if you need to talk ok?
Aight
Shit Keenan what happened?
What classes r there
Yeah but it's worth it for the banter between him and grimoire Weiss
Bit the va for Dad nier is great and also 'protect daughter' can be much more compelling than sister
See that's what I originally thought
It's kinda bad looking
Yes
Goofy
But yes there is a translation you can download I think
Keenan basically the only difference in nier replicant is change 'daughter' to 'sister'.
Some of the lines Dad nier says are really good bc they were coming for a teen boy
I wonder if they make a kaine one
https://m.imgur.com/a/vnsA0
Also why won't they restock the collectors edition so I can blow $200 on an art book and 2b figurine
Hmm ok
Did you say it has crossplay between platforms?
You should buy the complete version it's still not much
Why won't squeenix let me give them money for nier merch
Ill consider it
Lol the new thief is 5 dollars
The full version with both expansions is 19.99
iV*
There's 1 that I think is final fantasy 6 (labelled as I've) + Chrono trigger for 7.49
https://store.na.square-enix.com/spring-clearance-sale-all
They're selling new PS1 games
Keenan you should check out this square enix sale
DOTA ALL STAR MASON MADE HIS SPLASH ON THE COMPETITIVE SCENE BY SHITTING ON KIDS WHO HAVE BEEN MAKING PENNIES FOR YEARS WHILE HE STROLLED IN AND WON MULTIPLE TOURNAMENTS AND MADE FAT STACKS.
WIDELY REGARDED AS THE BEST PROFESSIONAL DOTA 2 PLAYER IN THE SCENE BY HIS PEERS AND FANS, MASON REMAINS HUMBLE AND EAGER TO LEARN.
EVEN THOUGH HE NO LONGER PLAYS, HE STILL HAS IMMENSE RESPECT FOR PEOPLE WHO TAKE THE GAME SERIOUSLY.
NOW LIVING A LUXURIOUS LIFESTYLE REMOVED FROM THE DOTA SCENE, MASON ENJOYS SPENDING HIS TIME READING BOOKS, WALKING HIS DOG, AND MAKING LOVE TO HIS BEAUTIFUL GIRLFRIEND

keenan i cant tell if you've been fucking for 6 hours and now need weed or you've been annoyed for 6 hours and now need weed
yeah gimme 15-20
I really want a multiplayer fps that's not overwatch
I've had to stop myself from buying rainbow six siege I really want to get it
Nice
Also I would get really frustrated quickly if I was trying to do some big modded build with very limited resources
I mean I think that's possible if you install some creature mods along with all the magic and tech stuff
mac make it so
i've heard its pretty hard
we should try this pack
are you drunk
https://mods.curse.com/modpacks/minecraft/254433-invasion
because we've been talking abt in for awhile and also to prove to myself that im capable of it lol
I'll give you some if you want, I just wanted to do it like once with Clara
I might be buying some Saturday
Keenan do you ever smoke weed anymore
Yes
Yeah that's probably good
We down for twin peaks Friday?
Good!
I'm looking forward to it
I've been drinking the old Rasputins I also got
I was actually gonna drink it this weekend, have you tried it?
I haven't been at home so I didn't make them yet
Only one out of Eg,  secret and og can make the grand finals
Like look at this final seeding
The games are great but why do all this shit if it's a single elim bracket for everyone
I don't understand this group stage at all

Did y'all see this matchmaking update
So basically tekkit
Industrialcraft and treecapacitator
All I want for sure is like buildcraft industrial
It has bukkit infrastructure for servers
We can use tekkit for most of the mods
Lol
it was for me
yeah

hell yes gigabyte has a program with a slider i can control my motherboard leds with
i was talking with my brother srry
not cpu
ost
and yes mac that's the one i bought
yes keenan you can borrow the cpu
thats the hardest ive laughed in a week or 2
keenan have you listened to the mbmbam where theres the guy on yahoo who wants to give himself a colonoscopy
time to get balls deep in some minecraft mods
i dont want to rely on the laptop hd essentially strapped to the side of my case
i ordered a cheap headset and a ssd
Reddit sponsored ad: little league for Minecraft in your city!
ok im ready
Yes 1 sec
Noticably so
I mean I'm not a big graphics snob but my DotA looked like shit
But rn I need to revel in my $900 of hardware
I will
So I have to take it upstairs
Keenan the problem is now the monitor I was using for my PS4 is attached to my computer
It's gonna happen
dota in 60fps max graphics is freaking me out
ok i gotta do the dishes and then ill play
And it can do 5ghz wifi which will be a blessing
My pcie WiFi card worked right away which is great
Looks like stuffs working


It's time
I went in the palace the 2nd time
A little yeah it's p dope
I love fujiwaras design
But yeah ppl were bummed
U can probably be HuffPo queer
Well idk maybe u can be a diaper fetishist that's pretty queer
U cant
He was my favorite to use for a long time after I unlocked him for fusion
Have you beaten Odin yet?
Yeah it's cool how you recognize the spell names and things
One of the things I didn't learn until the last couple bosses are how crazy powerful the 'all stats up/down' buffs and debuffs are
I had Krishna as mine
Get that and a good support demon and you're set
Oh yeah the app upgrades that regen mana for you and your demons by walking around is crazy strong
The physical damage spells are so much better
The weird paradox of strength builds is that it's still almost never worth using weapons outside of grinding
Nice
What kind of build u rocking?
Nice
Fuck I can't wait to buy this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYUOe8yY5Ck
Costume dlc too
<@155893986605793281> they announced a coliseum battle dlc for nier where the bosses include the literal squeenix and platinum ceos

<@!127535721857679362> do u wanna play
<@!71716577669550080>
@zeldo u done yet
Anyone want to play DotA in abt an hour?

<@!127535721857679362> ill play
I can play later I'm at work rn
I sat next to the sub guy during a presentation and he spent half of it mumbling comments to himself after everything the presenter said
So not only is Roger at this conference he brought that douchebag North substitute teacher lol
cool
cool
Either of you gonna play DotA tonight
You have to plug them in with usb
Did you guys know they make rgb mouse pads
It's a server gpu it's not for gaming
But you can pay a premium to get the cutting edge of what that (Pascal?) architecture can do
The tech isn't there to make something significantly better in a consumer gpu
It's expensive because it's their most powerful card that isn't a workstation card like the one I linked above
But it's about 500$ more expensive
The Titan is like marginally more powerful than the 1080ti which is their best 'gamet' card
Already outdated you need a Titan xp
Shit I shoulda saved up for this

Did you have to modify the voltage on your mobile to get your 6600 at that?
Ok I think I'm just gonna get a cheap air cooler
Do you just use a air cooler?
<@71716577669550080> what cpu do you have
Which makes it sound like I'm his weed dealer I hope I don't get audited this year lol
Did I tell you he's started paying me in checks that say 'purchased dry herbs' on them
Because it would be such a pain in the ass otherwise
Also I only reported my gameworld and YMCA income this year on my taxes
Corsair is what I got at first before I saw the other kit
Cool
Also Keenan did you get a tax return this year?
What set did you get?
Which is like 140
Coolest ram I've seen other than that trident rgb
Also I really really like the aesthetics of the dragon ram and it fits well with my build
Yeah I've heard all ram has been on the rise
I'm gonna try and play a lot tonight
I replied earlier I haven't played it since the first time since I've been hella busy
Eh it was 117 for 16 gigs of 3000mhz that's pretty standard
But there's no logical reason for that I just like buying stuff
Mac I was very tempted to return most of my stuff and do a ryzen build instead
Also I gotta return one set of ram
Cpu fan*
Getting real excited to put my DotA 2 on ultra with weather effects
I got everything for my PC build except a couple fan
That's about the pace of both KOTOR games
Lol
<@155893986605793281> Mulholland drive is on Netflix u gotta watch it
I haven't played since my first time tbh I've been hella busy
Nice
Keenan is that game made by the katamari people?
<@71716577669550080> I finally pulled the trigger on some RAM and then I saw this cool as shit set https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B06WVBWCHJ/ref=ya_aw_od_pi?ie=UTF8&psc=1
aww
theyre so good together
yeah they've kept up the quality really well
and he's basically just doing his carl voice its great
the guy who made aqua teen hunger force and voices carl and meatwad
and it's voiced by dave willis
theres an episode where they introduce stevens uncle
lmao so
that means you're almost to the roadrunner ep
that one still makes me the happiest
I showed you the one with the pink girl right
i now ship peridot and lapis harder than anyone else in SU tbh
fears fiance is pretty cute
<@!71716577669550080> ready
whats differesnt about it?
give me like 20 minutes
"We have no gay people in Russia—there are homosexuals but they are not allowed to be gay about it.
The punishment is seven years locked in prison with other men and there is a three-year waiting list for that."
'After a successful career in television, movies and Broadway, Smirnoff turned his mind to understanding the mysteries of happiness.
In May 2006, he received a master's degree in positive psychology from the University of Pennsylvania.
He has taught classes at Drury University along with Missouri State University on this topic.
He also gives seminars and self-help workshops on the topic of improving relationships.'
' In the late 1990s, prompted by his divorce, he retooled his stand-up act to focus on the differences between men and women, and on solving problems within relationships.'
fuck i'm reading about yakov smirnoff following last night
That was his job for awhile tho so its second nature
https://youtu.be/MEqKTjE50FI
Lol
What's the mk equivalent of fox only no items final destination
Idk Keenan I feel like I don't have the greatest grasp on the furious lore
Have you seen this?
You heard about this?
And he said and I tell you this story a little bit I'm not making this up now
Even Carlin
I mean every comic at that time had their hack bits I feel
He was fine and seemed pretty charming
Whose show he was on*
Shows show he was on
I mean compared to say, Rodney Dangerfield
Simpler times
I went to a Slavic talent show Clara was performing at tonight and they played a yakoff smirnov clip
Gotta add that to my tight 5

I'm very proud
No that was off the top of my head
Woman probably think Lincoln-douglass is an auto dealership
God I know
Remember when he was recruiting house painters on facebook
Clara didn't  know you guys were roommates until just now lol
Right thats the other thing everything ive seen him talk about on fb he only ever engages with on the most basic high school level
Yeah and everyone can tell that which is why they don't treat him with respect
It also implies that the issues at hand are an intellectual exercise for him rather than something he actually cares anout
Which is what roger does
Yeah but its possible to be polite in an intellectually dishonest way
Regarding the debate I think some of those girls can be needlessly abrasive but I also just absolutely hate the way roger talks on Facebook so I don't have a lot of sympathy
^
Mac Clara's feminist group got into a huge Facebook argument with Roger
Srry
It was her
I mean
Idk they didn't even have an arg with clues spanning at least 3 years like tf2 did when they introduced pve
Great visual design but all the abilities are similar to other characters
Also that new character looks hella boring and annoying to play against
I feel like in terms of balance and playability overwatch is nowhere near as good as tf2 tbh
I'm not sure about that
Destiny 2
U know what I'm fukin psyked for
Were they fighting magneto
I did not hear abt this
Reversible gold foil cover
Its really pretty
Oh yeah my copy of Hyperlight drifter got here yesterday
Don't question mark lol
Because I can play it on the computer in HD for $15
I have a Xbox copy but I would feel weird plying it on my big TV upstairs
Bayonetta PC I can finally play it
sure
https://youtu.be/WUWQFnC2zqU
Lmao
which is another 100 ish
yeah but the other cost is missing two days of work
I was thinking abt it but since im making a lot of big purchases (and going to TI) I feel like I shouldnt spend the money idk
https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811112533
<@!71716577669550080>
@zeldo ready
I can in a bit over an hr
<@!71716577669550080>  so I have a black case and a white mobo i can light up any color should the leds on my ram be white red or blue
Tree in cm now
7.05
yeah will do
Every sales a wiiiiin buy it now or you will cry all niiiight
Every days a saaaale
Any cheaper would be illegal really
Cool
you'll probably be fine
ill probably bring my ps4
im sure phillip would watch you beat it anytime
830 or 9 if thats cool
have you seen the video where driffin and justin are doing a panel and they talk about the names the polygon ppl went through before they settled on 'polygon'
and the other write about video games for a living
i guess for travis that's his full time job
and he does like 10 podcasts
he was like a shakespeare company carpenter for a long time
he seems p cool and hardworking
idk maybe not the worst life altogether it just seems like he was pretty all over the place as a person
and just some of the decisions he made were kinda weird and bad
there was that one episode where they just didnt do advice and talked about their childhoods and he talked about racking up a lot of cc debt and working a ton of dead-end jobs for a long time
like hearing him talk about his young adulthood is kidna depressing
at least before he started mbmbam
also man justin's had kind of a rough time of it
yeah
but he also seems to have his shit together and be far more socially adeptmore than either of his brothers
i feel like travis is in the weird position where he sometimes feels a little on a different wavelength as far as humor goes
yeah i feel like once you cant take each other being around for granted you see them as people more
i guess if our mom died we'd be sort of forced to bond to survive emotionally
it makes me wish i had any sort of similar relationship with my brothers
did you hear the one where they talked about meeting jeff goldblum outside a movie theatre or something and one of them lit a cigarette and he freaked out
i love their trolls 2 campaign
i love how they all have tats and drink and (used to?) smoke

and so everyone on tumblr has been making fun of it
that was really unpleasant and goofy featuring this couple being like 'oh yeah its great we make fear and insecurity the focus of our sex life'
this webcomic called ohjoysextoy thats the most dumb uncritical kind of sex-positivity posten a comic about cucking

<@127535721857679362> do you want to play dota tonight?
not any closer
What
?
Which would make things difficult
Apparently a bunch of ppl didnt even know you could aim during those parts
Like your little dude can lock on to targets
That would have been good to know
I learned later that you can lock on while you hack?
Yeah I got really frustrated during that one
3
Idk a bunch of them are in those chests u hack
Yes
What are you doing tonight I kinda want to be there when you get to the end
Its worth it on the end tho
Its OK buddy now you've gotten through the third and fourth most tearjerking things in that route
If you delete his memories he sells you their heads to use as a weapon
Yeah that parts pretty brutal
My apologies in advance
Oh shit are you at Hegel vs hegel
Lol did you save the children
<@71716577669550080> shit Mac I should have built my PC in this https://m.newegg.com/products/N82E16811112533
I think theres a laser pod you find by fishing but I never got that one
Nice
Yeah buying all the storage upgrades is one of the best things you can do
For awhile I wasn't sure if you were supposed to die in the beginning when 2b gets knocked out and 9s has to save her and the machines are knocking out your hud
Route c be hard yo
Yeah
Hmm I think you need to get to the point where pascal has a quest for you
Go to mastsumo the forest blacksmith
If you're short on cash you can sell all the machine cores you have for a shitton of money thats all they're for
I wasn't looking for it I just kinda stumbled across it
Nah I think its just kinda in a sand dune
Its kind of along the east edge of the desert I believe
Also the rocket pod you find in the desert is good vs that
Just spam Dodge and get some hits in when you get a slowdown
Over clock helps for that boss a lot
I'm more annoyed that they basically reuse that design for the secret lv99 superboss
I actually didn't have too much trouble with him
Ballworm boy?
Also I never used a2s berserk mode all that much but from what ive heard the best thing to do is get a high level offensive heal chip so you are life stealing and can sustain it as long as you can
Time will slow down
Also when you get access to the resistance weapons guy again or can travel to the forest blacksmith make sure you've upgraded your weapons as high as you can it doubles their damage with each level basically
I was level 45 ish
If its a +1 or higher yeah its like bullet time
No I just kept falling into the crevice in the crater
It took me like 3 lol
Yeah
How many tries did it take you to get 2b to the right place
:(
What were the other 2
How hype is the trailer at the end of ending b tho
Also
That reminds me next play through I need to go do the TV machines quest
But at the time its just like lol zombie clowns
I think thats the first time you see machines affected by the logic virus
Yeah
Did you ever go into the basement under the amusement park?
And I wasn't sure if I was hallucinating or
It was crazy because you first see one in the hangar when 9s gets a flight unit to go help fight eve
Yeah that part really pulls the carpet out from under you
Did you start it yet?
5-10 more hrs I'd say
You should
I finally watched it it was super good
Mac have you seen hidden figures yet?
I think it'll be some pubstar mid
Who do you think will join
I can't tonight srry
BC I squealed v loud
Also how hard did you squeal at the trailer for endings c and d
Keenan did you see the ghost girls in the background of ending b
Lmao
About half of it
Have you gotten an over clock chip yet?
Like I said make sure to do at least a couple of the sidequests in pascals village
Yeah its nice
I can buy us booze
I'm gonna be 21 by then
Shit mac
I'm gonna do a final ticket on my phone and try and do a week one on a computer
Yeah
Is there any way to tell it to look for both final and week tickets?
This ticketmaster app fucking sucks
Idk I feel like since plane tickets cost so much I kinda want to stay the week but really just doing the finals does make more sense
Yeah I don't think Keenan has any interest
But we'd have to consider if we wanted to buy for a 3rd
Yeah I saw that
Is it 1 am they go on sale?
Yeah Seattle's dope
Yeah
She also might be in Israel then
No I mentioned that and she got excited cause she has FAM there
But I don't think its particularly dota related
Clara says she wants to go to kiev
Like in the next 4 hours lol
The thing is we'd have to really commit
Yeah
We could buy weed
Plane tickets would also be a pain tho
I mean it'd be a super cool experience
Yeah she is tragic
So would we just get finals tickets or what
yeah
carolina major when
im considering going now
are yall going for all 3 days
I'm so glad I stayed up to see at least game 1 where they beat ogs alch
Fuck yes ig
if you click on each one theres a little description

<@!155893986605793281>
same with sumail on alch theyre good at the hero they just cant execute that strategy
like yesterday arteezy had a 15 minute naga radiance but they couldnt play around him the way og does
they also just cant play them
and eg cant play around either of them
but alch is either totally useless or total cancer
i dont even mind naga
i have grown to really hate watching alch in pro games
luna bought rapier and still couldnt kill him
alch+weaver aghs
are you watching this game

and the choir kicks in at the perfect fucking time
yeah thats the one
fuck im rewatching the final boss and literally tearing up
also keenan never watch anything on youtube related to this game all the related videos will be spoilers
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGp4qVrKmR4
there was something like that when i went to a showing with laura once
what is it about
mac this should be on your video game playlist if its not already https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph4f06Q5ItE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWkao73HuU
<@71716577669550080> do you want to play dota tonight
I bet we can beat that
Shit
ok im gonna go do the dishes and then I can play dota
yeah this case is gonna be a pain to move
though i guess I had like a +4 autoheal chip
see i was really worried about that part but i didnt have that much trouble with it
but for my first build i felt i should get one with a lot of space
I kind of wanted to get one of those mini-itx cases that are just cool-looking cubes
yeah
fractal define r5
yeah my case is black i think with a side window so it'll look good
this is the one i got https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16813128964
its the kind that had like LEDS you can program and a really good sound chip which im pumped about
the mobo was on a deal where it came with a like $30 wi-fi card
The cpu was on sale
yeah i can play now if u want
also mac I was thinking about ryzen but it looks like its turned out that it's only better for multitasking and like rendering stuff so I got an i5-7600k
check if you have an auto-heal chip
which stage
at least ill be able to run minecraft well
because i went with a pretty budget-level gfx card but im getting a pretty top-line cpu and mobo
this pc im building is gonna be weird
I can play this evening
agressif has to be feeling rough after that one
damn
cool
are you done
hi
Almost there srry
I'll be ready then too
<@!71716577669550080> <@!127535721857679362> do yall wanna play dota tonight
The Adam fight before the factory tho is my favorite boss and boss music in the game
Yeah that ones hard
The ball thing?
Also this is the Zelda boss I was talking about last night https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pzxj_kole1U/maxresdefault.jpg
Gods
BECOME AS
https://i.redd.it/fkm17udv4yoy.jpg
Oh yeah that thing is baller
alright boys dota time?
play nier
do you have a spare monitor or should i bring mine
are you at your place or his
<@!71716577669550080> are u gonna play dota 2nite
Lmao
And it was worth every penny
Also I paid $37 for a meat entree
I missed the worst of it tho
I chose tonight to go out to eat
Im just sad the official OST doesn't have the 8-bit versions
Also the nier OST is really good but the way it's dynamic is automata makes it way less repetitive
Which is kaine salvation
Last night I met kaine and thus got to hear the best song in the og nier ost
Ooh now you get to meet pascal
'oh what fun!'
And talking to all the clown bots
I love that whole area
Yeah the music is awesome in that one
God he's such a hack
I'm just having a lot of problems with my constant erections after seeing that picture
Holy shit
I'll check it
I haven't whats it called
So I'm probably gonna buy that
Mac apparently the automata OST has new mixes of the songs specially to listen to outside the game
or ultima X rather
people have been waiting way longer for ultima VIII
2.8 is the ground zeroes to KH3's phantom pain from what i've heard
im actually interested since i started reading about how batshit it is
ooo nice
nice
(not including the endless blowjobs from CS hoes)
mac's gonna be like that
how pure
Also there was discourse about twinks sexuality and now I think I want to kill myself
And you would not believe how much slash fanart of Twink and firewater there is
And then looked it up on tumblr
<@127535721857679362> me and Clara watched sausage party

Make sure to pick up yr chips
Yeah that's where mine was too
http://i.4cdn.org/vg/1490699642033.jpg
Yeah u gotta hit him
Are you at THIS CANNOT CONTINUE
If you could get one players signature what would it be?
It would be
yeah my guy
kojima had nothing to do with sh2
what is sh2
?
yeah i will
ill probably borrow that after nier
ok cool
but do you have the ps2 or ps3 version
right
thats the one i most want to play
do you have mgs 2 for ps2 or ps3?
by the way keenan what mgs games do you have for ps3
i heard yoko taro described as like kojima but if instead of growing up on action movies and james bond he grew up on berserk and lovecraft
watch this german man lose his shit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll2qpvjc_XA
and nier actually rarely has more than 6 or 7 at one time
also the other big musou is a billion enemies
yeah
nier is definitelly not a musou lol
nier was inspired by god of war combat
drakengard 1 was a musou basically with air dragon combat
no
but theres also like multiverse shit and the fact that each game has like 3 endings makes things complicated
i've seen a timeline that posits drakengard 1 3 and nier as being in the same world and timeline
but there are some references to drakengard
and then nier automata is in the future of the nier world and has some references to the first one
not really
yeah basically
the lore is really obscure and takes some figuring out
but drakengard 3 is technically a prequel but the relation between it and 1 arent obvious at all
drakengard 2 was written by someone else and doesnt really have any relation
but that ending is what sets the events that lead to the world of nier in motion
and ends with a rythm game fight against a giant statue in modern tokyo
so drakengard 1 had a joke ending that was like an evangelion parody
yeah i know
but the lore is pretty nuts
clemp's videos are pretty decent
because i dont think anyone actually thinks those games are fun to play
you should also watch some videos on drakengard
absolutely
mac do you want to play dota tonight
mac do you want to play dota tonight
sunshine?
yeah
and everyone on reddit was like 'ol this isnt even a good fake'
remember when the 7.00 patchnotes leaked
damn keenan better get busy for the next 2 years
no
in all of fiction
is this perhaps the most powerful character
this image is like the oipposite of the effect you get when something gets stretched to widescreen that wasnt meant to be
this is your in to get hannah into comics
shit
In 2002, jazz percussionist Gregg Bendian released a seven-track CD, Requiem for Jack Kirby, inspired by Kirby's art and storytelling.
Titles of the instrumental cuts include "Kirby's Fourth World", "New Gods", "The Mother Box", "Teaneck in the Marvel Age" and "Air Above Zenn-La".[169]
i know and its more memorable and striking than thanos or anything like that
yeah thats pretty cool
galactus has a better character design than like 90% of anything else in marvel
no keenan im 20
'also a way for him to be killed by very small humans who can shoot lasers out of their dick'
'but now we need someone for him to fight'
'ok so this character is God'
with like goku and one punch man
its like when people try to make 'who would win'
like 'this character can do anything.
but this character can kill them'
I still just love the idea of quatifying the power of these things
i think comic book origin mythos is actually somewhat limited by it being a visual medium
because thats just basic af
does he have a 1-1 correspondence with the infinite multiverses?
yeah whats this guys cardinality even?
"possibly in all of fiction"
"Another character that is also called "The One Above All" is the most powerful character In the entire Marvel franchise, possibly in all of fiction.
This entity is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, and is responsible for the existence of all life in the Marvel Multiverse.
The One-Above-All is the master of the cosmic overseer and arbitrator known as the Living Tribunal.
This character is also known as "Above-All-Others", exists beyond all forms time and space, since they are all part of his creation, and alternates between appearing as a male and female"
and that shit
and thanos
and death
i knew about the watchers
and this shit is even more bananas then i originally thought
keenan im reading about the marvel divine beings
the nier/drakengard stuff is pretty wild
if you guys are ever looking for some *deepest lore* to get into
yeah im sure theyrte fine just very much not my wheelhouse
but great names
will never ever watch any of those movies
i love all the fast names
the sma5h and the furious tokyo drift
sma5h
super smash switch
mass effect ground zeroes
the only reason mainstream reviewers are criticizing the dialogue and shit is because public opinion was already critical because of the animations and stuff
and lets be honest
yeah its really weird actually like it seems like making a mediocre ME game that got like 8.5s and 9s all around would not have been that hard
much like skyrim
but that's not necessarily because of the standout quality of each of its consituent components
yeah my point is that it's a impressive and ambitious series that is pretty unmatched
kinda standard sci fi stuff
yeah its impressively deep but still
like the story in the first two arent even that great its just the only AAA space opera video game
and I feel like bioware isnt capable of that
but you'd have to mix it up a lot and make it super interesting for me to want to get a new one
mainly because its pretty much the only time something like that has actually been done in a videogame
the thing with mass effect is that the first trilogy is good
You might put out some feelers for some other relatively light/generic systems
I'm down
Yeah i could get into some dice rollin
http://i.4cdn.org/vg/1490556294595.gif
i think its explained in some stageplay he wrote that the blindfolds are combat visors but i think its mostly just a visual reference to emils design in the first nier
nah
yoko taro said in an interview he just likes girls
no
http://i.4cdn.org/vg/1490555189085.png
yeah commander is stacked
whereas the machiones just exude a sort of sexual charisma
well for 2b its probably because you can see her diligently-crafted butt every time she jumps or uses a ladder
the machine robots or the android robots
Does gw have any more copies you can swap out?
:/
y
i mean none of them were super farm dependent
that sniper had almost 900 last hits
<@!71716577669550080> wanna play dota
basically every song title in the automata ost is a spoiler other than that one
<@!71716577669550080> best song in the automata ost https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwBh_7zV4Wo
i just need to find a place for it on my desk

Keenan my copy of nier is digital but will lend you my PS4 if need be just so you can play this game
Hell yea

whoops
<@!127535721857679362> WANT TO PLAY DOTA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TcLxlkc2pA
towers have 4 less armor unless heroes on that team are nearby
idk hopefully the gold nerf will help that
i feel like we've reached this point where hero abilities are starting to feel less impactful because of just how much stuff every hero gets for free now
and everyone continues to get more powerful
so instead of finding like an equillibrium there are always a few broken heores every patch
man i feel like this update is just continuing this weird trend where every patch about 5-10 heroes get nerfed and all the others get buffed
oh wow
bane base damage increased by 4 lol
What was tp CD before
Juggernaut is like my least favorite pub hero to play against right now
Man why couldn't it have been any hero other than Juggernaut
Aw shit
Also damn those SMT Alice and mettatron figurine
Well I'm in jail now
damn
yeah you'll have to tell me all about it
and im about to cry
I finally got to the true ending
but nier automata is a strong contender for best game i have ever played
i know everyone is on spring break and dont care
Nier is so good I just fought a giant robot opera singer adorned with the bodies of my dead comrades amidst a robot staffed amusement park
See if you can find one of those used panty vending machines
@everyone anyone for dota later?
Yeah I only played the first hour or so but it's awesome
Nier
Nicer automata is fun as fuck
guys steam has 'garfield kart racer' but its only single player?
the fuck is this we could have had our new game
Only for ranked
Is that a no
<@!71716577669550080> <@!127535721857679362> do you want to play some dota?
When is the Tetris movie coming out?
Yeh
Keenan Phillip hasn't texted me back can you ask him about tonight

Can I play Wii games on it?
Oh, no I don't want a switch
'hey do you guys have a new Wii?'
When they finally open the doors
He'll be first in line

Any of you boys checking it out?
This game is getting some good reviews!
Idk why discord thinks overwatch should be all caps
Like the tf2 comics and cinematics and stuff are still so much better than anything they made for OVERWATCH
I'm gonna be honest valves writing team is (or was, a lotta people quit) way way better than blizzards
Keenan have you ever read the valve comic collection?
It's p good
Mac I know you really love halo and gears of war but just have a little chill?
Jesus guys keep the console wars on 4chan
But that seeing the people who started playing in like 6.83 and claim they could isn't enough to demonstrate that memory can be faulty
What makes it great is not just the people getting super defensive that yeah you totally could and they don't just remember it wrong
https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/5wkmwc/convince_me_that_you_could_ever_euls_an_allied/ this thread is a trip

I'm planning to put together a computer over the next several months so im just gonna get each part when theres an appealing deal lol
ronald im actually looking at getting the msi 470 cause theres a deal where it comes with a xbox 1 controller

Ibuypower And Asus have some OK ones
True
The moto x is a good deal tho, especially the newest one
They make really fucking ugly desktops
It does
I haven't
yeah speaking of you should really read that book i gave you i want to know what you think
bingeclock.com says 28
its longer than 12
in anticipation of the new season
i was thinking of asking you and phillip if you wanted to watch (rewatch in our case) twin peaks over the space of a couple weeks
also
yeah man im down
lets do it
thank god im gonna get to 5k without you scrubs holding me back
fucking FINALLY I can play dota again
Let's watch they live too
Yeah dude I'll watch it with you
Sorry was at best buy
I need to watch escape from ny
Wanna go and just yell 'whore' at him the entire time?
That movie looks like shit desu senpai
I don't sadly
Pinned for when I have a working computer

Keenan I bought gravity rush 2 today it's hella fun
This is why I shouldn't read chat backwards
O Ronald claimed it
O shit Mac I'll take the witness if u still have it
Keenan is The Boys worth reading?
Wow that's a pretty good bundle
Who dat?
Do you know if gw has any copies of gravity Rush 2
<@155893986605793281> are you working today?
It's gonna take about 9 hours
I'm using a Linux recovery tool to make a backup disk image
I ran some hardware tests and the hard drive failed some test
And today it started bootlooping repair mode
A couple days ago my computer started running incredibly slow to the point I could do anything no matter what I did
My hard drive might be fucked so it could be a little before I can play dota
Also I just took a like 7 hour nap
My computer has been fucked for the last few days
When
Aw man I'm sad Bears lost
7.02 out
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VqiHiMuEkes <@155893986605793281>

guys help i need to be talked out of buying the undertale soundtrack on vinyl
i already played but sure
<@!71716577669550080> want to play dota?
k
<@!71716577669550080> do you still want to play?
I just woke up from a nap
yeah that series looks cool
sure
man i just want to do one of those mods where you build like a rocketship but it takes fucking forever
theres one that involves breeding bees to get like any resource that looks nuts
theres are some pretty damn intense farming mods
youre fine dude
they added 10 new heroes to dark moon
<@!71716577669550080>
mac want to play bloons td?
At least play like the first hour to see how nuts it is
Nocturne
When are they gonna release a floral controller thats what I wanna know
Its not quite as fun
Yeah its really weird I haven't gotten very far
They've gotten pretty crazy with the upgrades and stuff
Bloons TD 5
Yeah
Yeah
We should play it
Theres a coop mode
Bloons tower defense
You know what I spent 2 hours playing last night
keenan have you watched touched the skyrim yet?
yep
youve beaten more games in the last month than i have in the last three years
<@!71716577669550080>
@zeldo all set
let me eat dinner first
in the 'inspired by your recent shopping trends' section it always just has incredibly cheap looking steampunk goggles
without fail
no matter what ive been buying or looking at
fucking amazon
individual flavors too
you can get jelly belly straight from jelly belly
also i think that steve bannon is trying really hard to provoke a terrorist attack so trump can declare martial law
I just found out the other day i can buy a family size box of french toast crunch off amazon
Thats a great idea keenan
In a bit maybe
yeah the only reason i consented to get glasses was that i couldnt read class powerpoints tbh i never use them outside that
um, i think those are some alternative facts youve got there
hes a lil different because he's actually pretty talented, just extremely mentally ill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHaXPBL1I-I
have you listened to daniel johnston?
they put out one album because some fortuneteller told their dad his daughters were gonna be famous popstars
yeah theyre pretty renowned as far as 'outsider' music goes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR9d4ESlpHY
yeah theres rules to it but theyre pretty arbitrary
seeing what came out of fusing my demons when i didnt know how anything worked
yeah that was my favorite part of the early game
also fusing them up is pretty helpful
how far are you?
yikes sorry my guy
did you just not save?
do yall want to play something?
http://is2.4chan.org/v/1485630521853.png
its a documentary
http://railroadsoftware.tumblr.com/image/156470866500
hi
<@!155893986605793281> you should watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvhchxHUCA0
cool
@everyone videogames?
<@!127535721857679362> <@!71716577669550080> dark moon?
The comic?
one of yall has to play a game of this Dark Moon thing with me 2nite
new dota event boys
although apparantely the script was about the same guy that Shogun was based on so thats pretty cool
yeah i think thats more 'inspiration' than anything
Keenan are you getting nioh?
http://lesbianrey.tumblr.com/post/156384152740/pondwitch-skumpitt-go-go-powdergangers-you
I like the one about how Sean Spicer chews and swallows 2.5 packs of cinnamon gum before noon
Also the rein one looks exactly like an earth spirit set in dota
Reinhardt, zen and dva skins are all some of their best
This ow event is probably the best batch of skins yet
I wish
They didn't include any dumb ones like James or donna
Wow those pop figures are like literally the perfect selction
July 29
I NEED ALL OF THEM
FUCK
my favorite politics related thing of the last couple months has been social media anime nazis realizing that the politicians they put in office think theyre a bunch of autistic dorks
nooo
what a weird fucking person
I read that holy shit
I need to do the dishes
Half an hour max
Also I might buy drakengaard 3 to play on your ps3 l
Ive been enjoying it its different enough from the 3ds games to not get stale
Keenan did you end up getting nocturne?
<@71716577669550080> I can play in a bit
Nice that's a good deal
What am I looking at here
Winning consecutive bo1s against VP DC and IG is nothing to sneeze at
I'm pretty impressed by faceless at this tournament actually
<@!71716577669550080>  ready
yeah give me like 20 mins
I mean I think like all of their marketing has been focused on the fact that its NOT a typical/hardcore console.
Zelda is just the only one of their big franchises they have lined up for an actual lauch title.
They're going heavy on the portable/social/convenience thing which I think has the potential to be huge but not having a bundled just makes it so much less appealing as a thing to buy for your kids and stuff like that
that and the whole 'multiplayer is a phone app' thing
thats one of the details that have come out that looks like a genuine blunder
whats really weird is that its not bundled with the system
anyone wanna play videogames
I really want to play dota its been forever
I can starting at 4
dude do it 100%
Fancy cake trays
I started actually playing SMT Nocturne and it's simultaneously kind of goofy and badly written and the coolest game i have ever played
i dont think thats remotely close to true keenan
and george rr martins hack take on human nature
it is fundamentally a show about politics
the fantasy is window dressing
yeas, the show is about politics
thats such an insult to alan moore and you know that
its metaphorical in the most boring way possible
The primary reason i dont like the fantasy is because i know its not in service of a larger vision
live action television is the worst medium possible for grand fantasy stories
also there are way better ones in animation
thats like being the tallest dwarf
otherwise its just masturbatory
it is if your base material is solid
because its not actually a series about anything remotely interesting happening
Especially because you know that the lore will always be tangential
lol game of thrones has the most boring fucking lore
the thing is fantasy doesnt inherently make politics more interesting
if its any consolation ronald i agree with you
pretty good deal
it was 70+tax for the special edition with the prime discount
yeah
finally put in my persona preorder
It sounded kinda masturbatory
Idk I was just reading about it on Wikipedia and wasn't sure what to make of it
keenan have u read crossed
Sorry I can't tonight :( I can like any other night this week tho lol
Coincidence?
I think not!

http://vintagegeekculture.tumblr.com/post/155787644306/1980-meeting-of-the-most-famous-anime-club-on
u can watch all the vods at work
https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick
get in chat lads
the top 2 guys speedracing metroid were 8 seconds apart
smt has really good music
i think nocturne is supposed to be a little scary but mostly its just dark and edgy
IVA had about 1 scary moment in it
this was shown to a room full of japanese businessmen i applaud atlus for that
its just a penis
like not even just a very phallic demon
pretty much the second demon you see is LITERALLY a giant green penis with a mouth
idk if yall noticed this but in the SMT switch trailer, when they pan to the demons and then cut to a closeup of Thor and zoom out
<@!71716577669550080> dota?
a game no-one knows almost anything about that has no release date
i cant believe best buy is letting you preorder octopath traveler
you got neon right
mac are you preordering rn
http://i.imgur.com/VkJvstu.png
this rave is wasted on these businessmen
i agree
does anyone want to play a videogame for the hour before the humungously important event starts
what
anyone for video games
what if real life had cross species breeding
keenan they're about to speedrun arkham city
On pc
Yes it is
I guess it is being made be the total war guys
And lore
Base building pretty much
But see thats like the opposite of what we like about aoe
I know that's my point
Aoe 3 had deck building
Keenan ill be square with you that sounds awful
You'd be even worse at starcraft
Its an actual game on the xbone no one saw that coming
Yes sometimes with blurs apparent where amethysts 14 incher would be
All the characters will be cropped tumblr Steven universe porn
Let's make a dating sim but every character is dysfunctional and if you break up with someone you switch to playing the game as them and have to try to pick up the pieces
Didn't they add dating sim stuff to fire emblem
Cmon Nintendo get with the youth
Wrong you cant use the switch as a worse skateboard
Well they obviously didn't have the cajones to follow through with that killer idea
Why has no one thought to make a hoverboard that can also play PS vita games?
Lol
Like a sex robot but it plays ps4 badly with you
Why hasn't anyone updated ROB for the modern age
Bombertale (true ending play through all cut scenes)
Call it bombertale
Yeah but we will give it an 8 bit soundtrack
Guys let's make the next stardew valley but instead of updating harvest moon it updates minesweeper
Theres like 5 people total who actually broke into the industry with a game design degree I'm sure
The only serious games are the serious Sam games
I spent 45 minutes pricing and stacking la croix today
Y'all are fucking dorks
Lol
Its pretty great
keenan come save us
im down
My dad would be proud
You'd be wrong about that
Last night I had a dream that Ronald flamed me so hard in a dota game that I uninstalled both dota and discord
no
we couldve been ahead of the curve
yes
u know what theyre doing for the final game

2nd street
<@155893986605793281> will you be able to pick me up from work?

OK you should pick me up too I'll be at the downtown store
Keenan were you planning on going soon after work?

You own it on ps4 right?
Btw I'll bring my controllers so we can all play rocket league
It's surprisingly hard
I've played it it's fun
Are we all gonna play this together
Thanks Keenan

thats plausible but also a pipe drea,
that all sounds reasonable
i heard it was gonna let you play skyrim

It's really aesthetically similar to old pokemon gamrs
Mac you should really play earthbound
Yeah when it comes down I bit more I'm def gonna
You def can
Paper Mario you really have to get gud
Except paper mario
Every turn based RPG is like that
Or get like etrian Odyssey or ffvi or fire emblem
Seriously Mac just get the first smtiv it's pretty cheap used now
Shin megami tensai is like Pokemons battle system but better and slightly more like traditional rpgs
Also final fantasy 6
He should play shin megami and stuff like chrono trigger
Bayonetta isn't a jrpg
People are still figuring out how to access it this is exciting
Frog fractions 2

http://i.imgur.com/q74I6Ar.png

they really should have had matthew mercer redo snipers voice
oh my god what if they took totoro
purge has literally been doing this patch analysis since like noon
I'll play in like 15 min
Honestly it was kinda weird with mccrees voice
They must have gotten the riki guy instead
O
that was a long ass game
i think ima play a test client pub
My gf told.me to watch that but I haven't yet
and the crowd is going nuts
od and merlini are just making orgasm noises

i keep rewatching that clip of maybenexttime jumping onto the throne as earthshaker
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su72-z6WJnk
timber ws already super good

Oh wait she throws 2
Aether lens blink rapier is the build

Anticlimax
Holy FUCK
That was the single best game of DotA I have ever seen
Yeah bias aside how can you not want af to win this whole thing
I mean yeah but I hate them at every event
I know that's part of why I hate them
They're obviously really good but they play such ugly dota
God I hate og so much
<@!127535721857679362> u wanna play dota w us
Them vs eg I'll be happy either way
Yeah I want them to make the grand finals
k ill probably play around 10
<@!71716577669550080>  do you wanna play dota tonight
Other than a few v boring Luna sd games everything's been hype
Also yes Mac this majors been so cool
Just wanted the smaller one?
Nice
Did u get a new one?
it turns out ben affleck could have had an alternate career as a youtube movie critic
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ahtp0sjA5U
Ehome took a bunch of early towers but aui got 16 minute radiance and then np just stomped every single fight because of their abilities
Ehome got sd Luna but in return np got naga-mirana-sk-warlock-disruptor
Np vs ehome went to a game 3 finally
That was some beautiful combo shit
NP!!!
That makes more sense lol
Why collectivist and not individualist
Cause that ground has been well tread
You'd just have to stay away from typical mythology and Abrahamic deities
You should do an avant gard pokemon
Yeah
SYLAR TO FALL
Yeah keenan I feel like if I was trying to design a 2d weird game I'd just feel way to influenced by like hotline and Undertale and frog fractions and stuff
I'll be sad if they do
Or weird level geometry
Like things off in the distance
And a lot of the things I'd want to incorporate would benefit from 3d space
I mean it's not impossible but it's been done a lot
Esp BC there's already do many quirky pixel titles
I feel like it's hard to do something like that with graphically simple 2d games tho
I sometimes wish that Stanley parable was like 4 times as long
Yeah I know what you mean
Wrong
What's another demographic people want to date
Pigeons and crippled people have already been done
Yeah we need a gimmick
It's like that
Mac look up kawata shoujo
Persona
And after about 20 minutes of clicking through this genuinely autistic persons inane fanfiction with no lewd stuff we quit
And Mac and I started this MLP anthro one
Did I tell you about that time Mac and Ronald and I were playing very crude hentai games
It's a lot of writing tho
I'm down
Where it's revealed there was a bird orchestrated genocide and you get hunted by a cyborg made out of the parts of your former friend
Do you know about the hatoful boyfriend secret endings?
I mean
I mean I played some of hatoful boyfriend
None of us even play those tho
Why
Ok
Hey <@155893986605793281> wrt to the movie I forgot Clara is going back to Indy on friday
video game anyone?
Google cardboard
Ouya
mac want to play dota?
Yes
Because a sequel to tfa is gonna take like 2 more years
Also it's because they want to make money and put out movies every year
It's set right before the original movies
Odin sphere got here today it's so pretty
It's opening night
For sure man
Cool I just reserved mine earlier tonight
Ben did you get a ticket for the first showing at 7?
cool cool
also were you still wanting to see moana?

yeah dude of course
<@240129712645603329> we still gotta play divinity
Anybody playing games tonight?
Aui carried hard
My boys np
Clarinarasauce
Also Clara says to add her on Snapchat so she can send you pics of mac
Search the name of the album followed by 'mega'
https://archive.rebeccablacktech.com/mu/
Just put stuff in folders on your PC and copy the folders on
Nice!
And this job is making me fucking despise old people
At game world I learned to be wary of rednecks who wanted to sell me things
Everyone in the Kroger meat dept hated asians
I think every job gives you a deep prejudice against some group of people
Treasure iv already
its so good
im watching true sight 2 on youtube
Didn't that happen with Go?
That sounds boring
Working alone in a big empty building all day but we making that $$
We doin ok
Are you playing at work?
I've heard mixed things
I'm thinking we start with 50/50 and see how it goes
And some mango mixer syrup
I have some champagne
Mac I figured out the perfect starter drink for you this new years
The skyrim theme is just the oblivion theme sped up

Keenan we should go bike shopping together
Does your family just know him?
You should read that article tho ppl are nuts
I left it outside an arbys for 2 minutes like a dumbass after a dental appt
Yes
You guys have to read this shit
http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/18121761/the-true-story-nintendo-most-coveted-game
Now my bike got stolen lol
I can play in like 20 minutes if you guys are still playing
But those look pretty cheapo
Bluetooth headphones in general are like flushing money
No
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg7OH0VAJ-M
I'm setting up my comp 1 moment
Yeah sure give me like 15 mins
Which game?
Yeh
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n8cdAsbSyRo

Lyrics OK?

william basinki the disintegration loops
i was planning to if thats still ok

im glad buddy
http://www.vice.com/read/ryan-comic-268-v16n12
lmao
Keenan this ps4 is half the size of the og one its amazing
Wind waker HD and Tokyo mirage sessions #fe
I'm sad because there are exactly two games on Wii u I really want to play but I could never justify buying one lol I hope they get switch ports
RPGs but with children fighting gods with the power of friendship
I can't see Ronald ever playing a jrpg
You can use the stick for camera or edge pan with the stylus
One for each ability
There's 4 buttons
Ronald I'm gonna be honest dota would be so much better on the 3ds
Ronald I think you'd enjoy zelda
And the stick
Yeah the buttons make so much difference tbh
The 3ds games I've played are like ps2 quality at least which is better than any mobile game ronald
Huh interesting
It doesn't???
That 3ds was like the best game related purchase I've ever made besides undertale
Yeah that's a great deal
It was a bit confusing BC they hadn't changed the game display prices but it still rang up right
Got my giftcard and game
It was like that a kohls but at Walmart they had a literal pallet of ps4 bundles and checkout took 15 mins
I know
Didn't even have to pull my switchblade
OK idk what y'all were on about that took 15 minutes
Time to brave the fires of hell (Walmart)
Kohls was out which sux cuz they had the best deal
headed out boys pray for me
http://i.4cdn.org/v/1479964638448.jpg
<@!155893986605793281>
we'll see
hmm
night
i can just go tomorrow tight
yeah i think im gonna go walmart cuz therez a 30$ giftcard if you get it in store
arteezy playing visage with ac deso mjollnir
jesus christ this eg og game
360 for a refurb
its 450 at best buy i think
but yeah its probably shit
i mean im sure its functional
sites
yeah i cant find anything on it on the usual sights
equally good use of your time
or you could mail me $20
its not just jrpgs mac but yeah all probably long games
yeah and I could still replay new vegas another 2 times probably
i just know im gonna feel bad for spending money
the thing w the ps4 is theres actually a good amount of games on it I really want to play
and i know everything abt the story from ppl talking abt it
idk it just doesnt seem like a very good game
hour
yeah my problem is I have about 10 3ds games i wanna play and theyre all 50 your jrpgs
there would be no magic
i actually have like 0 interest in actually playing fallout 4 at this point
amazon is doing a lightning deal where it inclides skyrim remastered and fallout 4 but i dont actually want those games
and maybe far cry primal

its weird because buds as currency were so arbitary anyway, nobody even liked them for aesthetic purposes there was just a fixed amount and everyone decided they were a good currency for unusuals
idk what happened
buds are going for like 2 keys

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GW9o4q1wXk
hmm
did u check out tegan and sara
anyone gonna play games tonight
you can do it by icon
every single messaging service needs that\
the switch had better suck my dick for that kind of money
rather than plastic boxes
about how glad i am that we've moved to the point where mainline consoles are finally looking like glowing monoliths
i was thinking earlier
lol i texted him it is him
is his like that?
the person didnt post a picture but its this model http://www.rondomusic.com/INTEPRO727EBEMGNSATDOT1.HTML
i actually really want the guitar i hope its him
i just messages someone about a guitar on craigslist and i have i feeling it might be sam spevak
is it worth seeing in theatres
was dr strange any good?
yeah those are my thoughts
well guys if this game ends up sucking I'm gonna have egg on my face
What was your favorite set u ever owned Ben
http://is.4chan.org/v/1478915289376m.jpg
Video games suck honestly the worst toys
They had such weird lore and interesting design
They were the coolest toys
I got a big dragon for Xmas one year and spending all day putting it together may be my favorite gift memory
I was looking at a bunch of sets I used to own yesterday and having a huge nostalgia wave
Were any of you guys ever into bionicles
u gon play?
all my amazon reccomended items are steampunk accessories and i dont know what i did wrong
ey i get to sleep in tomorrow does anyone want to play videogames
Have u guys seen any of the trailers for this horizon zero dawn game
though i was fucking in shape when i was 12
probably would be more so now that i am an adult human
i was looking at some videos of karate forms and remembering how satisfying learning that stuff was
like in the most ridiculous ways possible
honestly how fun would it be to really kit out a truck
keenan we should start taking martial arts classes together
https://northamericanarms.com/shop/firearms/naa-22lr/
id feel less afraid of it
i think that'd be my sidearm of choice, a very compact revolver
a time could come when id want a revolver that shoots miniature shotgun shells
but now its like hey
it was weird
like it was this thing where he was this totally nice and kind and decently liberal guy who just owned a bunch of guns even though he didnt hunt (he lives in a very rural place to be fair)
honestly though over the years my grandfather's view of firearms has become more and more reasonable to me
no but it was a little alarming idk how id feel doing that in a high pressure situation
so i could see that its not like in videogames
my grandfather had me unload the entire clip of a colt 45 once
keenan have you ever actually fired a gun
ill buy your ps4 and then go to your house if anything happens
lmao
lol
although you can buy this thing jesus christ https://www.walmart.com/ip/Mesa-Tactical-93000-Sureshell-Carrier-And-Rail-For-Kel-Tec-Ksg-12-Shell-Both-Sides/37850830?action=product_interest&action_type=title&item_id=37850830&placement_id=irs-104-m2&strategy=PWVAV&visitor_id&category=&client_guid=5c8b6f14-e920-40d5-8e79-2f1585deb072&customer_id_enc&config_id=104&parent_item_id=3170101&parent_anchor_item_id=3170101&guid=f5180127-03f5-49e4-bdcf-dc04ba6c73c9&bucket_id=irsbucketdefault&beacon_version=1.0.1&findingMethod=p13n#about
im sure theres plenty of places in bloomington that do tho
i feel like wal-mart doesnt have handguns
but man do they make guns sound appealing with many features
thinking about actually doing it is more sobering
this is the most fun kind of online shopping actually i've spenty years browsing catalogs in my grandpa's catalogues
the air guns are brighter colors usually
which i dont, idk if you do
ok so from what i see the only thing we'd have to do any paperwork for other than a background check would be if we actually wanted to carry the handgun around
ok wait im finding conflicting things
u have to be over 21 to buy a handgun
ok so
is there something i need to do beforehand
yes
he seems well adapted to his niche
of course
?
Heh
The gameplay is actually so well designed it's probably the best part even considering all the cool mythology stuff
And I'm finally really figuring out how fusion works and how to optimize
I have one more dungeon in apocalypse I think
Yeah I'm hype
K cool
Did u check on persona for me btw
Come to sahara Mart I'll lock you in until you cum
I feel bad but mostly I hope she doesn't get fired cuz itll mean wayyyy more stress for everyone else
She's a deeply weird person
Ben I can drive a van load of dates to your house and no one would notice
And over there the closest thing we have to a manager is on the verge of tears and saying she got in trouble and might get fired
Then I took some dates over the the other store in the van which I had to lock up because there was an entire nee shower door in it along with some pricy wine
I spent 3.5 hours alone in the freezing store sitting next to a desk w a fucking space heater running
This job is so fucking weird I swear to god
So keenan who gave up and checked first, you or Phillip
im so glad im experiencing this relatively alone]
threw up in the toilet

I'm gonna watch it w clara
OK good

Be there soon had nerds in my basement
Yeah I can play whatever just give me 15 mins
Yeah I'll play
Anyone gonna play anything tonight
Maybe idk
So Mac you recommend the plain spaghetti here?
Was it a Thomas Moore book that name is in my head
I'm about to go to a restaurant
I mean something to do w spirituality
Keenan there was some book you lent me awhile ago when we tried meditating that I never gave back do you remember what it was?
Yeah I'm hoping I age as well as my dad/grandpa on that side
Fuck
I'm more like mom
My brother is more like dad
My dad's not scary
Yeah that's why pros play tanks and mobility probably
They don't play defensive heroes at all but still lol
Yeah but even then it's not like pros play defensive heroes on defense
Her utility is obviously centered around an offensive play style
I mean classifications are meaningless
I feel like reaper is like 1 buff away from being broken tho
And she has 200 health
It's got a 60 clip
Idk lol watching the live stream have said it's p good
Or soldier
She just has more utility
I feel like she's not that different from the way tracer is a offense hero
Like she leads with that when you're pushing point
Ult
And her out is def an offensive setup
She has 2 mobility skills tho
Yes
Def will tomorrow tho
Probably not I'm going to drink champagne w clara
But then their whole team walked into black hole, he bought another rapier and I ended the game at 30 minutes with 2 rapiers and a rampage
And got an ultra kill right away
But their prophet went boots-midas-maelstrom-rapier
I was playing Luna and it was a fairly standard/even game
Mac I need to tell you about my game last night
She def does
Still young ana then pharah for me
Yeah we are all gonna have to DL hots on the 15th to get it
http://m.imgur.com/0ZOnYGD?r
Oni *
OMG there's an onion mask genii skin you unlock by playing 15 hots games
Half hacker half cruella Deville
Yeah but her in particular
Also her character design would be 100% better if her whole head was shaved WTF is with that
Even if it's short it'll combo so well with stuff like Pharaoh and mccree and genji Ult
Emp disables Shields and turrets and abilities in a radius around her
Yeah
Ult
Emp is 100% her yet dude
Also rip torb and Reinhardt w emp
And if her machine gun is even as good as widows hacking means she can win like any 1v1 except mei
Yeah
OK this hero looks broken
is keenan?
yeah
i can play
And I have a more expensive pair of grados now
I had the old version of the audiotechnicas for years they're great and super comfy not a lot of bass tho
Yep
Grado is best looking and most sonically interesting
Soundstage*
Also best soundtrack probably
Audio technica is biggest and least portable
Audio technica and sennheiser are comfiest and best for videogames
Hmm OK I'd say either the audio-technica ath-ad700x, sennheiser hd558, or grado sr80e
Is it a problem if they leak sound
Do they need to be portable
Would you prefer over ear ones or in-ear buds
Whats ur price range
But both are 11/10
That's how I got into them
Actually sainthood might be better to start with
But ASAP
And by right now I mean next time you are in a position to listen to music
Listen to the album the con right now
Tegan and Sara are legitimately my second favorite band and I listened to at least two of their albums almost every day over the summer
If I met meeeee
IIIIII wouldn't like me
God why is Tegan and Sara so good
This phone has p damn good speakers for a phone

Hi my name is Ebony Dark’ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair (that’s how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u don’t know who she is get da hell out of here!).
I’m not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he’s a major fucking hottie.
I’m a vampire but my teeth are straight and white.
I have pale white skin.
I’m also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I’m in the seventh year (I’m seventeen).
I’m a goth (in case you couldn’t tell) and I wear mostly black.
I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there.
For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots.
that he doesnt actually know how to do it

i didnt do well at iu my man
lol I dont want them to even know i went to iu
ty fam
i dont even need one for this application but hers was so glowing i figure itd help
if u could do that by like tomorrow thatd be fantastic
if you could thats all i need
yeah but the only way i have to contact her is facebook
ugh i have to find a way to get in touch with mrs wilson so she can verify the recommendation she wrote me
even the iphone doesnt use it
usb c is great but nothing but smartphones use it
https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/818MjqbkjtL._SL1500_.jpg
when will amazon tell me when my beautiful phone will arrive
im pretty sure thats just a wii u keenan
175 might be easier but 200 is prolly fine
at that point tablets will be able to run dota anyways
and then ill just get a tablet for heavy stuff
i think my next computer will be a small box with linux on it that i will hook up to an old monitor and extremely clicky mechanical keyboard and install unneccesary amounts of security features on
that one does look nice
yeah
ugh
4 proprietary connectors no one uses
physical escape key
no escape key
literally some shitty thing lenovo already does and nobody likes
its like theyre doubling down on everything people hate about apple products
goddamn this new macbook pro looks like shit
didnt lego do this like 10 years ago
yeah
When i told the register girl at hot topic how much i appreciated that they finally had a howls castle shirt that didnt have the english title she said they got these suicide squad shirts that said something nonsensical about donkeys in japanese and they had to send them back
complete with hot topic 'daddy's lil monster' shirt
nah dude im joker and ur harley
who
depends on why u r seducing 😉
idk man i dig the hypertwink look
perhaps
i just want to look like a super andro anime character
god why must i be a hairy beast
nice
im sure lol u might have to tie it or something
also u r gonna get hella pussy
im so jealous honestly id kill for that
did u shave ur body
So, since their last console release?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RiHmQcHa84
and i dont mean $200 ones like i have
is a decent pair of headphones
honestly if ur getting into music a little more the thing that will make the absolute biggest difference
would be easier than typing all this out
yeah sure
so u have to either make sure theyre mp3s when u burn them or convert them
which nothing but apple products do
yeah it just doesnt play itunes m4a files
i have the 8 gig
oh i guess its old or low stock or something
it was a godsend over the summer
i forget to take it places/keep it charged often tho
yeah its really simple which i like
i have a https://www.amazon.com/Colorfly-C3-HiFi-Music-Player/dp/B00CA2DGZW
search the album name and mega
https://archive.rebeccablacktech.com/mu/
(or buy it)
yeah mobile i either burn the cd or pirate
i havent used spotify in forever actually
utube, spotify, the public library, sharethreads on /mu/ if those fail
god im so excited to have a phone thats not 3 years old and shit
as opposed to other jobs u have taken that align w your ethics?
thats how he makes most of his money
when hes not interviewing Kiss or going on tour with bands he just writed copy
thats what my music journalist pal does
lol
yeah keenan u should live in harlem
they are shitty
ive been to one of those

keenan heres a chill homework album you might dig i listened to it a lot during the summer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3EKEwMXmXY
sespecially on offense
that was fun
lol
well the 32 gig was only 10 on amazon so ill go w that
do u guys use 32 gig sd cards in your 3ds's
if u know what i mean
the fact that that lightsaber is double-bladed means we could truly share him
where a stream shoots from heach of his horns
i want to turn it into a fountain
idk if i have the proper display faculties to do it justice tbh
is he selling you the accesories too or just the comp
the graphics alone is probably 200 or something
hes a fucking geek
dude do you een know sam

u better hope they have game worlds in seattle
that sounds like the easiest way for me and ronald to stop being friends
but i have a couple in mind
i might do purdue tbh
im not going to iu
applying
the motherfucking common app deletes all your information every year
y is applying for college such a pain in the ass still its 2016
ill also have to see if the oneplus 3 goes on sale around black friday that one is supposed to be one of the best androids period
oneplus has these faceplate covers u can swap but its basically either wood or kevlar
or https://www.motorola.com/us/products/moto-x-pure-edition
and im looking at either https://oneplus.net/2/
anyway im looking to buy an android smartphone for around ~$300
o well

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCOgvAIL3_U&list=TLZ1wr4rT18gU

i had no idea he was still alive
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFxN67HIYvA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gupjrl5ZSX0
dog or song?
the 9th song is maybe in my top 3 favorite songs ever
his voice takes a lil getting used to but its possibly the best straight indie rock album of the early 2000s and hes an incredible songwriter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKmixRYUFBE
ok i have two in mind would you prefer a softer slightly more country one or a more rock type one
instrumental?
Work appropriate?
theres enough things at sahara mart that i could spent literally all of my time there and there would still be 20 things that needed to be done
gotta do it on my one day off instead
i wish i could play games at work
welp my afternoon is gonna be spent playing my 3ds in front of a space heater idk about you guys
more than battleborn
hopw many twitch viewers do you think it has
holy shit guys larry the cable guy: health inspector is now available on steam
<@!155893986605793281> I had a dream where Mei from overwatch was hanging out with the crystal gems, and then she got captured by some cultists (one of whom may have been peridot), who were trying to essentially carry out the plot of neonomicon i.e.
have her raped by a lovecraftian fish monster and get impregnated with a new cosmic horror.
They failed because she was on birth control.
The dream then turned into an extremely depressing and overly long Neil gaiman comic where she meditated on filth and vermin and extremely gross bugs throwing up other gross bugs out of which exploded dead birds being eaten by gross bugs in graphic detail.
Mei concludes that the best way to keep that gross stuff away from her is to get all the filth and decay she is due in her life out of the way by having a horrifying child and she heads off to fuck Cthulhu and have his kid.
The end of the dream was a bonus note in the graphic novel where Neil gaiman explains why he subjected me to way too many gross bugs (it's because he was depressed at the point of his life when he wrote that)
finn the human and jake the dog are different episodes you might be confused
or jake the dog i mean
??
I think finn the human is the end of that mini arc
what
An then go right to jake the dog/Finn the human
The lich
Do you want feels or fun or both
Are you guys playing yet
its just a totally innapropriate medium to deal with that subject matter
well apparently he dumped a girl in college after she miscarried

so now people make loss.jpegs
which just trying out of nowhere to wring melodrama out of your annoying badly drawn characters who have never dealt with anything serious before is really silly
and then one day he dropped http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/143/193/cad-20080602-358b1.jpg
which for years was just the worst tyupe of dumb randow wacky gamer humor
so theres this shitty penny arcade ripoff called 'ctrl alt delete'
to be honest loss.jpeg is one of the few memes that makes me consistently laugh out loud when i recognize it
i know

mac u gonna get in on this undertale biz?
dling it now
endless fantasy is way better than it has any right to be
i just want an album
is their new album out?
what kind of game is it
awesome
I killed medusa hell yeh
The switch looks like what the wii u should have been but they didn't have the tech
Ronald just watch the three minute youtube video lol
They announced super Mario brothers 4
Have an overwatch LAN party with all our joycons
Can we play overwatch on it
Only important question is
What if you open up the case and it's just two ouyas hooked together
In the future all game pads will look like 64 controllers
Yeah and I don't want to carry something like that around regularly even if it has good battery life which I doubt
But if it has wii u backwards comp and a good lineup I'll get one
It for sure doesn't make me regret getting a 3ds
Yeah how is this gonna be able to run skyrim well and also come with all that shit for a reasonable price
It's literally all those photoshop mockups people made holy shit
Can one U you link the video when it comes up pls?
1 min to go and there's a jackhammer upstairs so I won't be able to hear shit lol
?
y not
i just created a demon thats essentially a stripper amazing
and yeah i use 3d
which is an rpg that came out last month where you summon and fuse demons and angels and monsters and fight gods and stuff
ive clocked ten hours in this game called SMT IV Apocalypse
plus my 3ds is eating all my game time rn
i just dont have much free time and id rather play ow with everyone than dota and exclude keenan
i had fun last time we played dota
keenan when r u gonna finish undertale
im trying to put together a few decent outfits so i dont keep buying clothes
mac we need to buy you a vaguely ironic oversized black sweatshirt from h and m
but also fits me
it is very overpriced
they were probably wearing something from h&m
think of every chinese student youve seen on campus
h&m is the best store for tall skinny people and asians
which im sure is indicative of some pretty shitty hiring practices but
tbh all the girls ive seen that work at h&m are pretty cute
where did you go
it will also come with minecraft 2, half life 3, and a new open world rpg featuring all of nintendos first-party characters in an epic ensemble cast
you can make your own pokemon and then 3d print them
its actually just a box that goes on your head and you control it with your eye movements
it will include a fully functional 3d printer
mother 4, metroid prime for real this time and super mario 4D will be launch titles
turna' left onto a-kirk-wood
nx is actually just nintendos new line of smartphones but the siri equivalant is voiced by mario
portable
Its portale because its actually a R.O.B.
u can get to follow you arround
and im sure i can just hide in the bathroom around then to see the announcement
ill have access to chat though
Ima be at work
at 10 am?
https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/788900063833493504
that was a fun bike home in the rain
They hired him when they went to buy a synthesizer from the store he worked at
The new remixes don't do as much for me
I like the Snes stuff best
fusing demons to make new demons is addicting i cant stop
lets fuckin go
im just waiting on furious K
I've mostly only ever gotten that in tf2
its a good feeling
ill play when u are done w dinner
holy shit my cousin reprimanded me for using the word 'pussies' what is life
I can play in half an hour if yall are still on
Ronald I just drank some cheerwine and thought of you
What's going on in this chat
my brother was accidentally aborted at age 4
im not even kidding
ronald go fuck yourself
lol
are any of us voting?
also im a leftist not a liberal
he knows even less facts then me
i hope to god u never argue with philip about this stuff
and i wont try and get you to care about fags
you dont get personally offended by my own opinion of american conservative ideology
lets make a deal
its funny that you are the one arguing this with me, because I made that post in lieu of writing one about how much i hate hillary
what i am saying is that directly contributing to activities and policies you ostensibly find distateful in order to curry favor in a swing state is cynical and disgusting
all of that has literally nothing to do with what im saying
because i guarantee you 100% that none of the people who donated to that have for example donated to political prisoners and their defense funds
and it has nothing to do with letting opposing views be heard
then directly funding their office is a tacit endorsement of that and incredibly hypocritical
the bathroom bill state
and this is north carolina we are talking about
the point is, that if you genuinely believe that republicans, for example, cause a lot of harm to black people and lgbt people in that area
it has absolutely nothing to do with how i personally feel about gop offices
but regardless
i would not give a shit
if ISIS blew up every republican office in the country tomorrow
something very important
i need you to understand something
ronald
ROFL ronald commented on my political post
if trump wins i dont think the news will be avoidable
i feel like if everything seems relatively normal ill know hillary won
im sure i could go into sahara mart every day for a week and not hear about it
when ppl make posts like 'in hillary i see a person with cracks but those flaws just make her more human and courageous' i have to bite my tongue a il
god bless that man
like ben carson
i have to restrain myself to not go off on random ppls posts about how i hate hillary
when are u gonna paly undertale for us
it looks so cool
http://personacentral.com/shin-megami-tensei-iv-final-official-art-book-preview/
the art book for apocalypse is only out in japan such bs
dude made an album with sunnO))) a couple years back hes a fuckin legend
which just happens to involve field recordings of someone punching a pig carcass in a meat locker
and then unlike virtually every other aging artist of his time he actually adapted modern forms of niche music and made it his own in a fresh and engaging way
he did some solo records afterwards that were more standard kinda baroque pop stuff  and they were critically acclaimed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIZe_dLa58U
he was in a band called the Walker Brothers during the 60s and 70s that was peers of groups like the beatles
have you looked up who scott walker is at all
listen to that playlist tho its good
which has nothing in it lol
o see i thought you had somehow accessed all my youtube playlists and were askingabout the one labelled 'clara'
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDnop9bibeWGHZ_AE9g93JYFkuL7BvGj
the mix i made for lina is straight fire though you should check that out
i think theres nothing in that yet
I can't take the chance
It's very important to me that I witness your reaction to what comes immediately after
Keenan u should stream you fighting asgore tonight

i search 'links awakening' and the first 5 results are ppls vlogs
why is the eshop so shit

i mean this is my first ds so i have a shitton of games i want to work through lol
yeah i do kinda want to
this is pretty cool https://www.etsy.com/listing/225761144/super-nintendo-famicom-snes-cover-decals
bc i want to be able to enjoy this evening
i just ran and got a charger from good ol gameworld
maybe
sm3d was preinstalled i didnt need to download it
lol ok
check if u have a spare charger if u dont mind
bleh
are you at your parents house or on campus rn
it has half a charge thank god
is the sd card slot under the bottom plate?
aaaand im gonna have to find a mini screwdriver
lol
motherfucker i forgot im gonna have to buy a charger
or maybe a decal
yeah im gonna buy a new plate asap
and the guy i talked to seemed to have way more trouple with 'a new 3ds' and 'a New 3ds' for someone who workes at friggin gamestop
i stopped by gamestop just to see what they had used but their used n3dsxl were 180
target didnt have it
I had to drive all the way to fckin walmart but they had the bundle for 150 which is p damn good
So uh I finally caved

ill play tonight ronald
lets buy it together its gonna take both of us to lift it
keenan this is the holy grail of gaming crts
https://bloomington.craigslist.org/ele/5823062459.html
k
hey guys battleborn is 67% off lets all get it
basically the game world ds inventory
im looking at video game listings on CL and its so funny everyone selling their ds + games obviously already sold all the games worth anything and are now throwing in 'pirates of the carribean' and 'sponge bob racing' and shit
that ds works so well with my attention span for games i really want a n3ds
yeah thatd be more convenient for me
when are they gonna announce the NX i have so much $$ now
we're such bad friends
whats macs middle name
but that still leaves a whole lot
we can eliminate british, scottish, and irish
what is a european accent
I thought u gave up on that
6.50 i think
yes
keenan have you heard of this sunless sea game
I wonder at what age he became the person hes been for at least 3 decades

watch out shoplifters
my new knife is so cool

holy shit guys dmx is gonna be in indy thi month
because that pharah skin is the only good one in the game
are these gonna be season-locked like tf2 halloween items?
Fortunately we live under capitalism with an inherently adversarial consumer-seller relationship so nobody has to feel bad
When u think about Adblock objectively it's kinda lame
<:inflation:235213902856585216>
this better be a new emoji
hwat the fujk
took me waaay too long to figure out how to pick out stuff in the GBA LttP
single prettiest bug i have ever seen
and I saw a dragonfly that was metallic cobalt blue with jet black wings
when i war at my grandparents I went on a 3 hour creek walk through this area that has some adjacent properties but is mostly lovely and serene
Dragonflies are the only pure bug
spiders are great but not true bugs
wasps are really pretty but theyre all dicks
yeah but not when theyre bursting out of something elses head
I start thinking about parasitoids
every time i start getting a little too mother nature harmony circle of life and all that
hmmm idk about that
there are no better movies
i need to stop being a dumbass when people ask me what my favorite movie is and just say planet earth
im salivating
imax
ill go to ima for that shit
i hope they do a theatrical release
im barely even mad planet earth 2 is coming out soon
thats what i said
literally getting cucked by mac rn
http://i.4cdn.org/vg/1476049003505.jpg
it would mess with his image
and puppey fucked it up by being lazy and then secret fucked the players out of most of the money they did get
he could have taken it but he wanted to include his teammates
they offered him 500k for a single person contract
he was the one who initiated that
the panda tv thing
helping misery get paid
figuring out the secret 10% cut
for real tho gettin his team a million dollar sponsor deal when kemal was unable to get even a single paying sponsor
envy is anime
damn that hotpants interview where envy was like 'things used to be really great with me and puppey now not as much'
rtz already said hes staying out of it
i hope kuro makes a statement lol
theres no way that 5 just keep playing together
i think that secret suddenly withdrawing from the summit means they're scrambling to figure things out
so it makes sense to use nicks
i think its whatsapp
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLjCvWxaONk
http://archive.is/4OEUP
but i always thought that as arrogant as puppey is he always had a genuine vision for a better player org
i mean i suspected kemal was shady
During Shanghai Major I showed him the video.
He told me that if I ever leaked the video he’ll kick me from Secret
PuppeyRage
http://i.4cdn.org/vg/1476031692835.webm
shit meant to post this
http://boards.4chan.org/vg/thread/156939436#p156939436
are you reading this?
if all this is true puppey might be finished as a pro player
which people were mad about bc arteezy is like the biggest dota 2 streamer and ppl didnt want to figure out a chinese website to watch him
all the secret members had a contract to stream there
lots of asian girls doing yoga in tight pants
its an asian twitch equivalent
god damn
what the fuck major drama
the joke is that the comic has at least 3 panels more than is necessary
once again randall allows the joke to get away from him
so I can look cool when I open cardboard boxes
i just want to get really good at taking it out of my pocket and flicking it open in one fluid motion
ordered myself a goofy ass folding knife lol
i like the sith designs a lot
that was dramatic
i dont keep up with any TOR stuff tbh i just cant make myself care
lots of burial is pretty spooky

well the bad news is n64 emulation is a fucking mess
i heard about the comments yesterday but my brain was like 'same old, same old'
damn something trump said atually caught up to him
o yeah i might do that if i cant emulate it properly your copy seemed a lil fiddly
yeh
ronald you bitch now i have to sleep
ronaaaald

10km running
100 squats
100 situps
100 pushups

he spent a long time doing the hardest training regimen available
u sure about that boy
This antisemitism
I'm also very jealous of yr 10hrs sleep
Mac you missed the worst joke I've ever made about you but I screenshotted it so that it can be released when I'm dead and you're famous
👌
can someone who knows how go through and make this chat sfm (safe for mac)
ronald im sending you a goodnight kiss
o well goodnight yall
fukk i meant to go to bed 2 hours ago my job involves heavy manual labor
yessssss
i actually realy enjoy listening to old men espouse their eccentric worldviews
dude set me up im so down
I should add wendell too
helll yeah
does michael have a fb i want to add him
yes
Have too much fun with the boys my love!
I'll be dancing tonight too, I'm sure💜😘IFLYM
like thats just a railroadsoftware tumblr shitpost lol
How many of my friends here on FB…Know that we are not alone here on Earth and in the Universe?
is it that one u keep in touch with
my favorite is the link to a sales listing for a hot tub at the top
Hitler created the greatest economic recovery in world history…….he did it without gold…..he kicked out the jewsih mafia bankers……and along with them their debt based economy…..Germany began issuing its own debt free money and the jewish mafia hated this….
i know im really going for the gold
his eyes are smaller than your penis
ronald have you seen this man
and give him the big blue eyes
is there a website that automatically switches two peoples eyes in a picture because i want to do that
the very top one on her feed its noticable
but enough that its uncanny
like not enough that its a definite flaw
looks just by a tiiiiiiiny bit too big for her hair/rest of her
her face
no not that
will u be offended if i comment on your mothers appearance
ok
yeah
really i thought you were like totally estranged from yr dad
why does her fiancee have nip eyes
damn im surprised it took that long
shit boi
i hope ronald reads that before we delete it
we love you mac
there are so many things im not posting because this is a public chat that mac is a part of
yeah but if you're going for career minded normie nerds you dont care about forming a genuine emotional relationship with thats definitely an edge
keenan please
ronald if you get him laid ill give you lauren's cell phone number so you can join the brotherhood
ronald if you get him laid ill pay you $50
way more than when we talk about our sexual degeneracy or whatever
like he sounded actually pissed
do you remember how angry he got when we started talking about smoking
when we found that bag at ronalds place and got super excited for a second because it kinda looked like acid
remember
do you really think macs going to know
ronald
it was all downhill between us since then honestly
im still pissed he pussied out of doing codeine with me i was psyched for that
hi ronald
maybe we just need to do acid together
i dont think ill ever reach a point of genuine closeness with him but im genuinely happy hes doing well for himself
the devil u know and all that
i mean im sure if you think about it its not that complicated
yeah i definitely appreciate that about him
he seems like he has his heart in the right place
what a man
but just the way i communicate
not in like closeness or intesity or things like that
idk this is a weird way of putting it but i feel like the friendship i have w you is unique in that its the type i can usually only have w women
yeah
yeah
and i find it difficult to communicate that feeling clearly with people often
even stuff i care deeply about
but just a way of thinking about the complexity and many sides and stuff like that
insecurity
i approach a lot of things and issues and situations with doubt not necessarily out of like
idk i just feel like you are capable of approaching things or thinking about things in a similar way to me (the right way of describing it is eluding me right now)
yeah i can see how that would be an issue
but they are things i identify with a lot and one reason i value talking to you about serious things
I think your self conciousness and self awareness are some of your significant positive traits (obviously not in all ways and theres many manifestations of those things)
u also do the thing where you communicate sincere emotional stuff in your jokes voice and i know that turning off habits like that needs focus
less so than in high school i feel
you are just kind of casually dickish so bringing that to a level of more noticable intensity would require a lot of effort
and you know how hateful i can make my eyes
i must be slipping because i gave the gamestop employee me best silent death stare when he asked if i was looking for anything because he still asked perky followup questions
or things i find more eerie or haunting than straight up creepy
these are more subtle in general then the other ones
ANYWAY when i opened chat at the start of the conversation it was to post this https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDnop9bibeUkouiSfPcqbN-uXg60X1aJ
and i need to reconcile my desire to be a good employee with the fact that i dont give a shit about people stealing food lol
which is just not me
and i have to like ask people to leave their bags at the front and keep an eye on people doing shady things and possibly even confront someone
because its right across from seminary park
its something im gonna have to get reaquainted with if they keep having me work at the 2nd street store
like we werent awful or anything but still
like i remember one time philip and i and someone else drove to walmart at like 11am and went in and were loundly joking and being smartass kids and shit
like not in a condescending way just in general
one of my goals as a person is to be more aware of poverty as a dynamic in the way i talk about things
but on the other im pretty sure he was talking about how he was gonna beat the shit out of his wife for cheating on him or something
the guy who talked to me one night on the one hand it was a fascinating look into a guys mind who is so different from me and i appreciated that he was attempting to communicate something to me and he had his own sort of intelligence
yeah
yep
yeah im sure thats gotta be crazy weird
he didnt have a hook unfortunately
because even if i got mugged what a story
if i wasnt taking my brother home i probably would have stopped
i saw a bearded man with one arm doing the hitchiker thumb on third today
i still never carry cash because i would give it all away within like 2 days of being downtown
its such a case study in radically uncomfortable social dynamics
yeah
i gotta say i never once saw any students against state violence types there lol
like all the shifts i did there that werent cleanup i could have been doing homework minus the one time a dude gave me life advice
yeah im psyched for it to start again, i feel like if more people knew about it could easily be fully student staffed
o that
what?
did u watch the video
i need you to watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td-e4i2BL_Q
i dig it
keenan what did you think of i was a prisoner in yr skull
are you gays gonna play any ow tonight
if you're not making several thousand dollars per sale its a waste of shelf space honestly
thats how u do busiess
how much will u sell it for
how much did u pay
It fucking sucks
I gotta say
I have now listened to the album astro lounge by smash mouth all the way through at least 3 times
Thanks to working at Sahara Mary and my coworkers selection of CDs he found in his car
ill post it again http://phunderplonics.tumblr.com/post/151365555707/theoutli3r-toxic-geek-sushinfood-you
ronald and mac i really hope yall watched that video i posted
but its actually an attempt at a sonic representation of alzheimers
not overtly spooky
also i only put one song on there but honestly this whole fucking album https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL998ajnjN4
not metal or loud guitars or anything just like horror movie stuff
but the first couple songs have louder moments that are part of the creepiness

I got to world 4 in NSMB
i am willing to be part of this cycle

I also bought rock band 3 literally just because it had a tegan and sarah song in it
which isnt even supposed to be one of the good ones
i bought final fantasy 3
i worked there i understand the reasoning but its still annoying
i was in gameworld yesterday and yall have 0 good ds games

Nier

redpilled bro

Knights of the Old Republic 2
because deep down i am very petty
i was somewhat validated to learn shes kind of a shitty person
no i just dont like kaela lol

why
why
and its making me angry
he reads from a lot of articles written defending the prequels
theres a new plinkett video for the force awakens
who needs netflix
holy shit
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoOXFYfTLFA&feature=youtu.be
just in general
not in the game, theyre probably better than me at that
i just want to yell at some 12 year olds and epically own them in TTT
im so glad i didnt
Since it's apparently 2010 in this chatroom
While were at it lets start a YouTube channel I hear that's gonna be big
Fu I have notifications turned off for a reason
Went to bed to eg winning against og woke up to them winning against newbee feelsgoodman
fun times
shit i think i was at your house when u first met hancock
and by approved i mean sent me a picture of a note he had taped to his desk with the schedule i wanted on it
he approved my hours proposal so its all good
its on my resume
i didnt have him in my contacts so it was just a random text 'where are the tomatoes you brought in yesterday'
my boss texted me for the first time today asking where some boxes of tomatoes he watched me price and put on the counter yesterday were
yeah
nice
how long has he been w her
whats she like
really?
no yeah it was just funny because i think i had seen him around the store whn i worked there and probably would have been snide to him for absolutely no reason if he asked if we were hiring
yeah hes really chill and also pretty competent i think he just caught him at bad times
one of my coworkers tried to  apply  to gw a couple times and apparently eric was a dick to him both times which i think is really funny
60 if its after christmas
plastics
one word
no dumbass
Ppl do that on Craigslist all the time
Yes of course
The actual most annoying thing I face is various minor mental illnesses but I'm not sure you can apply that to entrepreneurship
They o ly drive backseat
They don't know what it's like
The most annoying thing I face on a day to day basis is people biking on the road
oversnatch
thats what we should watch over new years
im pretty sure we went over that like two days ago
http://i.4cdn.org/co/1475380141670.png
http://i.4cdn.org/co/1475379515830.jpg
yeah thats where he implied that she was raping him deliberately
that and 'lets have an orgy'
i forgot that entire movie except for that line
DELIBERATELY
because his real penis is jsut too big
apparantely willem dfoe had to use a stunt penis
yyyep
have you seen antichrist?
it was antichrist
my gf made me watch one with her and that was enough for the next 5 years
idk if you know who pablo escobar was
no
well
words i would never have thought id hear mac say about a year ago
i did not try it sadly
he had one called 'just one fucking drop'
i went to my grandparents and my grandpa started collecting some weird hot sauces
im impressed
damn son
did u puke ronald
ronald how are you with spicy food
do u guys know about pirate joes
they have ike 500$ wine
but it is sketchy and i think alchohol is how they make most of their money
i dont think its a front for drugs
you cant buy it if youre under 18
did help me get through that day tho
i also had an energy drink with fucking creatine in it which probably shortened my life span by a few months
very new vegas
i had some chinese sasparilla soda
working at sahara mart is kinda bad for be cuz im a sugar addict and they have a lot of weird sodas i want to try
i didnt know
at least none of us is an alchoholic like ronald
though the ones i take are extened release so idk how well that works for getting a more intense effect
keenan if you want some pills i can probably hook u up
and definitely dont bang them
dude dont hng out with bad influences
yeah brah
also mac if you ever want adderall hmu
macs gonna go stright to cocaine
im impressed you never smell like smoke when ive been over
lol
do you do cigs regularly?
this is a good plan
i also feel like the reason i never got hooked on cigs was because i was smoking them wrong
can you teach me too i was really bad at it
yes me you ronald and philip are gonna get high as shit
right, i forgot philip
keenan do you still smoke
that sounds fucking wesome
YES
i cant believe im feeling this but i really wish i was stoned right now
just cute stuff
like not even porn
i have to admit i have a folder of marcy x bubblegum wallpapers
oh my
i wouldnt go that far
hi

star wars battlefront 2?
borderlands 2?
portal 2?
age of empires 2?

i know this is a bit of a throwback
the bass in this one reminds me of the napstablook battle song
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJHr0qHqvNo&list=PL72325BBD77D6DBE9&index=1
also if you ever wanted to know what the inspo for the undertale opening music was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5_R4WMBZjg
but theres ports on psp and steam
well it originally came out on the PC88 which was a japanese commodore 64 type thing
i havent played super far into it but it seems cool
like so that you arent hitting them full on just glancing
its an interesting jrpg because the combat is nothing like most what you have to do is run into the enemy at the right angle
ys
its so good
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpLAeLzDvfw
I can't link it cause I'm on mobile but if you search 'ys soundtrack pc88' you will find a ballet ost
I hope that's the 10 hr version
Reminds me of the good ol days
They played a Dave Matthews band song at work
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhjsafZcrXA
He's with one of them at least bc she's messaging me that he's pissed
I JUST NEED ONE PLACE WHERE I CAN DISCUSS THE FINER THINGS IN LIFE IN PEACE
I WORK ALL GODDAMN DAY
Mac this is our hangout channel just turn off notifications if you're doing something
Her bait wasn't quality enough for them to go fishing
No offense
I feel like telling her u said hi would send her into an anxiety attack
I maybe can if I'm done watching cartoons w lina
it would be easier if they were just boxes but theyre filled with glass wine bottles so i have to be careful
its hard to load things as tight as possible into a sketchy van with my thighs
with a small break to move some heavy shelving units and fill more boxes with heavy wine boxes so i can lift and transport them
for the past 3 days
has been literally just picking up and transporting heavy boxes
my job
yeah except your username fucks it up
anybody want to play ow tonight
yeah but if i picture the one place on earth thats not a third world country it would be funniest to imagine <:ronald:230126993008623616>  in it would be finland
ronald please go to finland
polly pockets sounds like a sex thing
how distressing
http://gundamace.tumblr.com/post/150987928470/the-lusty-argonian-maid

honestly bloomington bagel called me to come in for an interview and if they offer decent hours im definitely doing that instead
its probably illegal
i spent a lot of today moving heavy wine boxes between stores
and by got a job i mean the guy hasnt told me pay or a schedule I just worked today and he was like 'come in same time tomorrow'
I got a job at sahara mart
y u coming for me like this

its a very interesting story on its own but with all the medieval theology and stuff its super cool
yeah its right up yr alley
wow what a cuck
keenan you would actually fucking love this book you really need to read it
“Benno,” William then said to me, “is the victim of a great lust, which is not that of Berengar or that
of the cellarer.
Like many scholars, he has a lust for knowledge.
Knowledge for its own sake.
Barred
from a part of this knowledge, he wanted to seize it.
Now he has it.
Malachi knew his man: he used the
best means to recover the book and seal Benno’s lips.
You will ask me what is the good of controlling
such a hoard of learning if one has agreed not to put it at the disposal of everyone else.
But this is
exactly why I speak of lust.
Roger Bacon’s thirst for knowledge was not lust: he wanted to employ his
learning to make God’s people happier, and so he did not seek knowledge for its own sake.
Benno’s is
merely insatiable curiosity, intellectual pride, another way for a monk to transform and allay the
desires of his loins, or the ardor that makes another man a warrior of the faith or of heresy.
There is
lust not only of the flesh.
Bernard Gui is lustful; his is a distorted lust for justice that becomes
identified with a lust for power.
Our holy and no longer Roman Pontiff lusts for riches.
And the
cellarer as a youth had a lust to testify and transform and do penance, and then a lust for death.
And
Benno’s lust is for books.
Like all lusts, including that of Onan, who spilled his seed on the ground, it is
sterile and has nothing to do with love, not even carnal love. ...”
“I know,” I murmured, despite myself.
William pretended not to hear.
Continuing his observations, he
said, “True love wants the good of the beloved.”
you dont have to cover them all the way just curl them so you're not lascerating the person
you cover your teeth with your lips dumbass
i'm fairly confident my blowjobs are worth 200 at least
who wouldnt
“Are there not moments," he asked William, "when you would also do shameful things to get your hands on a book you have been seeking for years?”
wheres mac when you really need him

“The monkish vows keep us far from that sink of vice that is the female body, but often they bring us close to other errors.
Can I finally hide from myself the fact that even today my old age is still stirred by the noonday demon when my eyes, in choir, happen to linger on the beardless face of a novice, pure and fresh as a maiden's?”
i know
only barely related but i have a fondness for “Daytime sleep is like the sin of the flesh; the more you have the more you want, and yet you feel unhappy, sated and unsated at the same time.”
hold on let me get my copy of name of the rose it has some really choice passages about lust
oh good someone has taste

He took of my top and I took of his clothes.
I even took of my bra.
Then he put his thingie into my you-know-what and we did it for the first time.

“Oh!
Oh!
Oh! ” I screamed.
I was beginning to get an orgasm.

Called "I miss the old Haram bae", man that would be so Haram bae.
That's all it was Haram bae.
See I invented Haram be.
It wasnt any Haram bes.
And now i look and look around and there's no more Haram bes.
I used to love Haram be.
I used to love Haram be.
The Youtube views Haram be.
Up in the news Haram be.
I miss the sweet Haram be.
Playing with kids Haram be.
I gotta say at that time I'd like to meet Haram be.
I miss the old Harambe.
Straight from the zoo Harambe.
Eating his food Harambe.
No attitude Harambe.
I hate the new Harambe.
Shot by a dude Harambe.
I'm Harambe, and this is my zoo enclosure.
I work here with my zoo keeper and my friend, cecil the lion.
Everything in here has a story and a price.
One thing I've learned after 21 years - you never know WHO is gonna come over that fence.
This must be why girls want to sit on your face.
The suction is like taking a dump that never ends.
My dick hard and getting my butt eaten out, I do not need air.
My heartbeat in my ears, I stay under until bright stars of light start worming around in my eyes.
My legs straight out, the back of each knee rubbed raw against the concrete bottom.
My toes are turning blue, my toes and fingers wrinkled from being so long in the water.
suck my big man meat with your tight boi pussy
shit

So that's a yes
Just curious
Would you be a couple's bull keenan
...that's nice but will she put out
At the time I was just kinda like
Yep it sure would be nice to be upfront about that detail
But she said it in the most John Green ass sounds better in your head way possible
'I'm in an open relationship'
'so I confounded their expectations by settling with someone'
And she was like 'ppl expect me to be wild and hard to pin down'
We were making out under a tree
I'm trying to remember what she told me
lol was it the open relationship thing
better than literally
ronald keenan and i almost literally touched penises
you read the entire conversation from earlier and enjoy the confusion of not knowing who is who
it dat boi
he thicc
im gonna play some ow tonight if anyone else wants to
💯 👌 💯 👌
when the whole squad is online
gotta love it
i dont understand
ronald i dont want you to feel jealous
ronald have you read this whole conversation
😱
who is the third guy again
is there even a word for quadumvirate
its the only way to form the Triumvirate
mac is crying in a corner
in the only true sense
yes
a little disturbing but still
im glad you did thats actually hilarious
I'm going to go rethink my life
well i hope she is living her dream of becoming a 'gypsy'
christ
what is it with u and traumatizing rabbits
no it was pax americana
im going to be honest, i hoped we would never have this kind of connection, but i also kind of figured it would happen at some point
i cant believe you didnt get my comic
only girl ive known who used flavored lube
decent time though
in retrospect that was fairly beta of me
she thought i was gay
yes
i hope not
did she say anything about me
how did that come up
did she know you knew me??
did she make weird cat noises
did u meet on tinder?
just how it came about
not the graphic details
tell me about it
did you really
lauren
who
and her boyfriend is ugly as sin and looks like a creep
that hipster girl i hooked up with who stole my comic posted a relationship status
lol
keenan if you're gonna be a whore u need to fully commit to being a whore
girls love that shit
im telling you if you went to a con dressed as jared leto joker u wouldnt even have to try
as opposed to college classrooms
but why do u think that
im not disagreeing
why
keenan i feel like if u go to like any con ever u could get cosplay pussy in like 10 minutes
1-5
only if u buy us tendies afterward
if i end up going i can prolly drive you too
yeah we will see
kinda
yeah in bloomington thats what i call kind far
i dont mind going but its kinda far
clara is trying to get me to drive her and im not sure if i want to

that seems horrifying
i once considered getting that dvd from the library
fam

customer service is our heart + soul with it we'll always meet our goal

k
have I got news for you kiddo
you think people who come in to sell used games are stupid?
yeah but it'd look fucking stupid
this is why ron makes the big bux
this is advertising 101 kids
it would be difficult to fit a picture of the state of indiana anywhere in the word 'indiana'
'world' has the letter o in it, into which you can fit a globe
its very simple
ti7 gets here and we cant have region rivalries because every team has a player from each region
new OG roster https://www.facebook.com/OGDota2/photos/a.1632052627082702.1073741828.1631316270489671/1748492985438665/?type=3

ya
anyone for vidya
sure
i have no context for this
https://gfycat.com/FearlessFeistyBlackbuck
I'm good at english but not particularly desirous of turning that into  career so its a bit of a wash
i just cant do it
its amazing
Clara is fluent in three languages and has dabbled in like three others
i've taken german.
latin and spanish in my life and suck at all three
i regret that my brain cant handle languages other than english
yeah he should have taken in about 2 millenia ago
i got really angry because he got a riddle from alice in wonderland wrong but other than that he just has autism
im not god at blocking him out but i wasnt a dick about it i dont think
are you talking about us in statistics?
but only ac repairmen
like the Freemasons
and start a secret society'
maybe ill become an AC repairmen
and that i'm still working on paying off the 5000 loan from my first year
I keep thinking about going back to school and then i remember its not just 1 on 1 with professors and you have do paperwork and deal with fuckwit business major classmates
i got a 4 on that shit in the 8th grade
>getting a 2 on APUSH
are we gonna play vidya
I learned today mac argued with a girl about how to study because he doesnt take notes
thats true actually
you would never voluntarily take a class with a jew
see now ronald i know you are lying at least
not like theyre studying similar things or anything
two classes with her no way thats a coincidence
i learned today mac is stalking my gf
class
what cass?
ill play either
in the ability description it says only either you or the target or manually canceling stops it
thats wrong i think
where does it say that??
no it cant
he seems bad without levels
i dont know
you cant cancel in with stuns im pretty sure
pit goes thru bkb
and his aoe is surprisingly strong
his ult and atrophy aura are kind of nuts
its hard to say cause he's so all over the place
i could be wrong but i think this heroes nuts
pit looord
I can play some if yall are free
I can prolly play
not an official recording but its the best i can find
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqrEKtmQjb0
they got estelle to do stronger than you too
its so good
they got the whole main cast to do it
Im literally sobbing
KEENAN HAVE YOU SEEN THIS https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=142&v=n7I7oKM4vGE
What freak is wreak game?
Mac I think you'd enjoy this book too I know you love semiotics and medieval philosophy
No your movie is shit asshole
I'll describe it next time I'm on voice
It's a book I just read that I think you'd really enjoy
Keenan have you read or heard of The Name of The Rose?
The VoiceOver was so shit I turned it off
The other day I was on Netflix and saw that they had it but it was the theatrical cut which I've actually never seen
I don't know but either way it kills the ending of the first one
Like why would u cast old Harrison ford this isn't Star Wars you don't get fuzzy nostalgia for old deckard
Yeah honestly there's like 0 chance that was gonna be good anyway right?
Every time I open safari it reloads the page I was on which takes forever cause it's shit
This phone fuckin sucks discord has to do the loading thing every time I open it and it takes like 30 seconds
I'll fuck the pizza
EE and crit to eg is a little iffy but it could happen
The rest of what that guy said seemed plausible
We'll see
Totally unsubstantiated but that's a good looking team right there
Have you guys seen the rumor that secret is gonna be artour, fata, zai, ppy, pie?
Is there an omnislash color he doesn't already have an item for?
Dual wield glowing swords?
Like what r they gonna do just make another mask but this time it glows?
It is sad
They had 0 response to the splitpush
And just the decision making
Sumail was p bad
He did ok
Eg were sloppy af
Dc fucked with their heads majorly
I cannot believe that game
I'm not even sad anymore dc knocking out eg makes this the best ti ever
Holy shit
I'm pretty sure just listen to him
Voiced by mccree lol
What the fuck new hero???
Who woulda thunk
What is even going on is digital chaos seriously gonna be top 3 ti
Pit loooooord
thank god he doesnt look like me or I'd have to kill him
oh my god that guy actually came into GW?
A rectal thermometer
And I got sick of people never blaming no tail when he was playin like shit on cloud9
They always run defensive support cheese which I hate
Tnc are my boys now I hate og
Those Tnc games were so hype goddamn
Yes
Rofl what now mac
They gave me hope and then tore it away
Ghfh
God I don't even know who to root for now
Why
Ughhhhh
Fuck
They were so close to pulling it back
I'm legitimately about to cry
FUCK
NO
Hollywood
Isn't that something
Hey boys just dropping in to let you know that they made no less than 28 movies and a popular radio series out of the comic strip 'Blondie' back in the day
And a batman/robin where ras al ghul kidnaps robin to see if batman is worthy of marrying talia
There's one where a purple and green guy called a 'poppupian' shows up and fucks with the xmen
He's also got spider man 100 where he grows all the extra arms
And I know he has the issue where kitty pride has to marry that weird monster
I've got 177 in front of me
He's got a couple Claremont/romita jr xmen
Are my pics sending?


It's just some scattered issues here and there but there's some really cool and creepy ones
I'm gonna bring those home w me actually you can look through them if u want
Hell yea
I just checked in to say I was looking thru my dad's old comics
Idk why the quality is s o shit
