125452744440938497 (2017-11-01T18:16:15.885000+00:00) : Especially because the third time in a row she used the exact same excuse about having car trouble that she told me another time

125452744440938497 (2017-10-19T00:26:41.034000+00:00) : 
125452744440938497 (2017-10-19T00:16:34.991000+00:00) : And I think I need to replay bc there's a hat hidden in the attic

125452744440938497 (2017-10-19T00:15:05.335000+00:00) : It's nice aesthetically yeah
125452744440938497 (2017-10-19T00:08:54.865000+00:00) : Especially compared to the train murder
125452744440938497 (2017-10-19T00:08:44.559000+00:00) : The city is cool but the first level is literally nothing lol
125452744440938497 (2017-10-19T00:07:28.434000+00:00) : The one thing that bothered me about that world is how much more interesting the train levels are than the penguin levels
125452744440938497 (2017-10-19T00:04:04.288000+00:00) : Yeah once they hit you once it fucks everything up

125452744440938497 (2017-10-18T23:59:19.319000+00:00) : Also if you just jump over his sawblade attacks they'll never hit you
125452744440938497 (2017-10-18T23:58:10.789000+00:00) : Yeah
125452744440938497 (2017-10-18T23:57:40.685000+00:00) : The only attack he has that's hard to dodge is the Disco balls cause they stagger you
125452744440938497 (2017-10-18T23:56:47.522000+00:00) : Honestly though once I took a break and came back to it I beat him in 1 try
125452744440938497 (2017-10-18T23:56:26.278000+00:00) : Yeah
125452744440938497 (2017-10-18T23:29:08.955000+00:00) : It's fairly similar yea
125452744440938497 (2017-10-18T23:20:10.080000+00:00) : The level before the boss is p dope as well
125452744440938497 (2017-10-18T23:07:14.167000+00:00) : If you hang out in the room w the world 2 telescope after you beat it you get a phone call

125452744440938497 (2017-10-18T21:41:45.160000+00:00) : Very simple
125452744440938497 (2017-10-18T21:41:30.034000+00:00) : I think my favorite audience q was some woman asking 'how do I stop my dog from coming into my room while I fuck'
125452744440938497 (2017-10-18T21:40:46.337000+00:00) : And they can't even get that far
125452744440938497 (2017-10-18T21:40:36.074000+00:00) : Literally all they have to do is set up some mildly off at scenario for the brothers to riff on
125452744440938497 (2017-10-18T21:31:18.834000+00:00) : Imo any question that has the potential to be ended with 'am I good?' is a bad question because it's just some dumb story from your life
125452744440938497 (2017-10-18T21:28:15.282000+00:00) : Woof you weren't kidding about these live show questions huh
125452744440938497 (2017-10-18T21:27:57.922000+00:00) : If I'm ever in a position where I need to dress formally ever I will
125452744440938497 (2017-10-18T21:18:19.203000+00:00) : Very cool but very expensive

125452744440938497 (2017-10-18T18:37:49.470000+00:00) : I feel like that pun is almost implied in the name because that's basically the only other way she could 'have sex' with anyone

125452744440938497 (2017-09-18T23:59:46.046000+00:00) : His head is really heavy he needs to balance
125452744440938497 (2017-09-18T22:38:56.171000+00:00) : Is the criteria just that you worked there long enough and you were fired?
125452744440938497 (2017-09-18T22:38:29.811000+00:00) : Do it
125452744440938497 (2017-09-18T22:22:16.878000+00:00) : And it's not because he only wants the best and brightest it's because there's no rhyme or reason to how things work and they're really bad at doing schedules and delegating resposibilities
125452744440938497 (2017-09-18T22:21:12.924000+00:00) : The turnover rate here is ridiculous
125452744440938497 (2017-09-18T22:21:03.550000+00:00) : But the fact that he has an infinite pool of educated people to hire makes him lazy
125452744440938497 (2017-09-18T22:20:36.084000+00:00) : See javad clearly has a large degree of business savvy
125452744440938497 (2017-09-18T22:15:56.516000+00:00) : That's what happens when you go to too many seminars on small business ownership created by hedge fund manager or something
125452744440938497 (2017-09-18T22:11:27.790000+00:00) : So they have no good concept of what I actually do when I'm not on register and that I do whatever bullshit they need every day instead of what my responsibilities should be
125452744440938497 (2017-09-18T22:09:29.450000+00:00) : Also him and and Sara never talk to each other and are terrible at managing employees
125452744440938497 (2017-09-18T22:08:20.784000+00:00) : And javad has very poor object permanence
125452744440938497 (2017-09-18T22:08:03.878000+00:00) : Because I work a bunch of night register shifts now, so when javad sees me it's usually standing on my phone because it's 8 pm and very slow
125452744440938497 (2017-09-18T22:07:20.393000+00:00) : My bosses have started getting on me

125452744440938497 (2017-09-11T17:13:49.279000+00:00) : Hmm I'm googling and you might be right
125452744440938497 (2017-09-11T17:12:32.775000+00:00) : I'm pretty sure I saw cardboard box versions at Walmart and such

125452744440938497 (2017-09-11T17:09:54.328000+00:00) : And the orange box which had several interesting and diverse games for a very reasonable price
125452744440938497 (2017-09-11T17:09:21.293000+00:00) : And the halo pc box which was the coolest thing ever
125452744440938497 (2017-09-11T17:07:15.495000+00:00) : And the Oblivion manual which looked dope as hell but wasn't great about actually explaining the game mechanics
125452744440938497 (2017-09-11T17:06:18.403000+00:00) : I remember Neverwinter nights came with a little spiral-bound manual that was essentially the entire fucking player's handbook in small font
125452744440938497 (2017-09-11T17:04:46.564000+00:00) : There will never be anything as dope to receive and hold in my hands
125452744440938497 (2017-09-11T17:04:19.587000+00:00) : I love those boxes tbh
125452744440938497 (2017-09-11T17:03:17.930000+00:00) : Not even to play just for your shelf
125452744440938497 (2017-09-11T17:03:07.733000+00:00) : You should start collecting those PC games with the giant cardboard boxes
125452744440938497 (2017-09-11T17:02:17.620000+00:00) : Hey pal my steam library is alphabetized too you're not special
125452744440938497 (2017-09-11T17:00:50.218000+00:00) : What would really make it tonally diverse would be if you bookended it with black ops 3 and FIFA

125452744440938497 (2017-09-11T03:07:50.088000+00:00) : Why doesn't this house have a bathroom

125452744440938497 (2017-09-11T03:06:00.993000+00:00) : How's the female character creator in fallout 4 worse than the one in skyrim

125452744440938497 (2017-09-08T23:53:18.462000+00:00) : Lol apparently demon asked EE to try to come to fnatic with him
125452744440938497 (2017-09-08T21:51:24.086000+00:00) : 'guys should we pay someone to draw the mascot for our company?'
125452744440938497 (2017-09-08T21:50:57.130000+00:00) :

125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T21:37:21.566000+00:00) : Don't shittalk halo 3

125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T21:26:41.743000+00:00) : Idk what your best approach is then
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T21:26:24.116000+00:00) : Hmm
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T21:25:04.877000+00:00) : And now I'm at work
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T21:24:57.784000+00:00) : And fuck you buddy I woke up at 8 drove to Indy and took two math quizzes in a row
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T21:24:29.805000+00:00) : Are the na servers split into regions
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T21:23:48.499000+00:00) : Yes
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T21:23:03.736000+00:00) : Lol yeah I found that recently
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T21:12:27.451000+00:00) : I think they said something about that when filling in people for awful squad
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T21:11:29.939000+00:00) : There's probably a polygon or something discord or twitch sub discord they use when they play w fans
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:31:58.173000+00:00) : Confusing show
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:25:48.263000+00:00) : So that raises the question of to what degree he and the arm are in league/what their relationship was then
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:25:19.992000+00:00) : He isn't but his arm is
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:25:11.081000+00:00) : I think he originated from Judy/was connected to judy but gained some independence
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:24:08.891000+00:00) : Hmm
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:21:50.234000+00:00) : Yeah Mike is still an enigma
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:20:07.025000+00:00) : Right but I think they may be different appearances of the same entity
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:18:59.513000+00:00) : I always thought he was connected to the jumping man
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:18:47.644000+00:00) : Idk about that
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:14:41.211000+00:00) : Yes, but I think that was given to her by the incel guy
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:13:00.550000+00:00) : But I don't think that name is mentioned in the actual original show
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:12:39.661000+00:00) : Right yeah they're obviously the same
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:12:11.833000+00:00) : In the trailer park
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:12:01.595000+00:00) : I think the chalfonts are only mentioned in fwwm
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:07:19.361000+00:00) : All interpretation is probably pretty retconny at this point lol
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:06:59.047000+00:00) : As with anything it's also possible that that just wasn't something they were thinking too much about in the original run
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:06:32.527000+00:00) : It's possible
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:06:27.528000+00:00) : Hmm
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:04:33.104000+00:00) : I think it might show that cooper/Richard asking what year it is at the end might be him realizing what's going on rather than pure confusion
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:03:58.319000+00:00) : I think that Mike asking 'is it future, or is it past' is really important
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:03:54.822000+00:00) : Hmm
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T17:03:06.197000+00:00) : Yah but her name isn't tremond
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T16:53:54.472000+00:00) : I think that two birds one stone was implying that cooper was making a move against Judy by trying to save Laura from that night
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T16:53:10.875000+00:00) : Possibly
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T16:52:39.022000+00:00) : Yeah Im struggling to interpret that
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T16:48:28.636000+00:00) : Naido was just Diane who Mr c didn't know had been freed but would have hurt if he found out
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T16:47:45.445000+00:00) : Because he knew the whole situation w Freddy and Andy was there
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T16:47:28.827000+00:00) : But when the fireman did the iPhone swipe he redirected him towards the sheriff station
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T16:46:56.551000+00:00) : No, see I think the coordinates were directing him towards the Palmer house
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T16:45:45.783000+00:00) : I think she was the voice on the phone when coop thought he was talking to Philip who said 'i will be with Bob again'
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T16:45:09.598000+00:00) : I think seeking out just was bad coops ultimate goal but I don't think he knew just why or what she was
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T16:44:34.872000+00:00) : Hmm maybe
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T16:42:23.127000+00:00) : That theory at least I think gives that stuff a more grounded place in what's going on and makes everything come together a little more
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T16:38:29.122000+00:00) : Some people have theorized that all the Audrey stuff and the weird Roadhouse scenes with new characters and little stories that didn't seem to connect to anything we're taking place in the Richard universe
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T16:37:32.332000+00:00) : That and the phone ringing made her house so tense
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T16:36:43.736000+00:00) : Like how freaky were those last 5 minutes
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T16:36:21.199000+00:00) : But I've come around to thinking that the finale was a really good fusion of their sensibilities
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T16:36:01.717000+00:00) : I think if it was just lynch it would have been so different that its hard to say
125452744440938497 (2017-09-06T16:25:08.713000+00:00) : I can't tell your sincerity level

125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T17:44:59.641000+00:00) : Calc was 15 minutes long because the Prof was in Nashville to watch the eclipse and everyone else wanted to leave to watch the eclipse
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:44:20.333000+00:00) : Ok I need to sleep now I have to drive to Indy in the morning
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:43:43.398000+00:00) : Yeah
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:41:31.216000+00:00) : So having the 4 as initatior is crucial
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:41:17.977000+00:00) : Teams need damage and offlane is becoming more of a core role
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:40:55.159000+00:00) : I think that because heroes are getting so tank/getting items that give tank or escape
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:39:16.442000+00:00) : Maybe
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:37:49.274000+00:00) : Because 4 is kind of the new offlane
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:37:31.589000+00:00) : Like all the best teams at ti were built around 4
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:37:13.632000+00:00) : I wonder if the new patch will change how important each respective role is
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:34:30.762000+00:00) : They just need good captains
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:34:03.909000+00:00) : Yeah, but that's kind of to be expected
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:32:52.269000+00:00) : It was great watching sg beat secret and almost eg
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:32:34.799000+00:00) : I hope that SA has a strong showing this competitive season
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:31:59.674000+00:00) : Reform mvp
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:31:24.227000+00:00) : Timado as mid lol
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:31:15.924000+00:00) : Maybe if moo goes back offlane
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:30:27.278000+00:00) : As carry?
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:30:04.642000+00:00) : Also where is poor aui going
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:29:17.551000+00:00) : Flee and stanking are both very legit
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:29:05.438000+00:00) : I wonder who freedom will get to replace him
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:28:45.241000+00:00) : Ccncs probably the best na mid not who wasnt on a top team yet
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:27:51.352000+00:00) : Yeah he's the weakest I think
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:27:35.578000+00:00) : Yeah I think that team has potential to be as good as dc at least
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:26:56.593000+00:00) : Didn't misery say he didn't want to captain anyway
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:26:41.956000+00:00) : Eh I mean it was fine when misery was on a team with puppey
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:26:06.718000+00:00) : But he's 9k so maybe he can shine, just depends on how well he and envy work together
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:25:40.247000+00:00) : I haven't seen anything from xcalibur after he was a fnatic standing that impressed me
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:25:15.319000+00:00) : Same with fnatic
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:25:10.580000+00:00) : I think ppds team is dependent on how well pajkatt and ccnc work together as a core duo
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:24:01.056000+00:00) : That guy also said secret is ace/midone/fata/yapzor/ppy
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:23:32.945000+00:00) : Also seems weird that ace is the best carry secret could get
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:22:43.195000+00:00) : There's a couple weird things like moonmeander playing 5 and fata playing 3
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:22:22.753000+00:00) : They all sound legit
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T05:19:33.099000+00:00) : Sounds interesting
125452744440938497 (2017-08-21T01:30:20.904000+00:00) : Who won
125452744440938497 (2017-08-20T22:51:29.023000+00:00) : We beat some medium bots pretty handily
125452744440938497 (2017-08-20T20:38:08.520000+00:00) : sure
125452744440938497 (2017-08-20T18:48:04.224000+00:00) : thats still not as good as the one where he dances to youre gonna go far kid

125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T17:46:25.972000+00:00) : I think I'm the only person who didn't like that movie
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T17:19:55.255000+00:00) : According to his snapchat
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T17:19:48.963000+00:00) : He probably hangs out irl
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T15:28:08.121000+00:00) : And I really want to have a casual conversation with him
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T15:27:50.066000+00:00) : Because everyone who's ever worked with him says he's the sweetest and a really nice and straightforward guy
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T15:26:24.731000+00:00) : See I want to hang out with lynch so bad
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T15:16:23.303000+00:00) : No
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T14:08:54.660000+00:00) : God that intro is just the worst
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T14:08:41.234000+00:00) : Lol it took me way too long to figure out what you were talking about
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T14:06:30.224000+00:00) : When will lynch direct a couch gag
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T14:06:03.768000+00:00) : It's that or DENTAL PLAN
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T14:05:27.802000+00:00) : That two-parter might be my favorite ep actually
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T14:03:22.094000+00:00) : I'm also a big fan of the red room sequence in 'who shot mr burns'
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T13:58:25.964000+00:00) : I think it's a really good look at why his films work the way they do
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T13:56:56.920000+00:00) : It's David Foster Wallace's essay about visiting the set of lost highway but also just about lynchs work in general
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T13:56:17.432000+00:00) : You should read this
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T13:56:11.190000+00:00) : http://www.lynchnet.com/lh/lhpremiere.html
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T13:54:49.401000+00:00) : I'm sure if you saw it in theatres at the time it'd fuck you up tho
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T13:54:21.684000+00:00) : Blue velvets good but not mind-blowing the way Mulholland or even the best parts of twin peaks are
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T13:52:29.065000+00:00) : No, I need to see that and holy mountain
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T13:52:18.537000+00:00) : Well yeah but that's because jodorowskys vision is kind of outside the realm of what was possible at the time
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T13:50:08.070000+00:00) : He could have easily faded away if he hadn't persuaded delauentis to give him a small budget and creative control to make blue velvet
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T13:49:20.985000+00:00) : It was a big blow to his career
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T13:49:07.975000+00:00) : Everyone else hated dune too
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T13:49:01.602000+00:00) : Well yeah but to be fair
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T13:48:43.227000+00:00) : It's because of dune he has creative control of all his movies now
125452744440938497 (2017-07-18T13:48:22.344000+00:00) : Lynch hates dune tho

125452744440938497 (2017-06-29T02:35:22.544000+00:00) : complexity i categorize with navi in that something is just not working with those teams and switching around isnt going to fix that
125452744440938497 (2017-06-29T02:33:47.931000+00:00) : dc is good but i really like the story of a newish stack of na also-rans powering through everyone else
125452744440938497 (2017-06-29T02:32:56.752000+00:00) : they were such a great story at ti but they dont look hungry anymore

125452744440938497 (2017-06-25T22:08:29.946000+00:00) : glee is really one of those things where time has vindicated the haters
125452744440938497 (2017-06-25T22:07:38.739000+00:00) : both are probably true
125452744440938497 (2017-06-25T22:07:30.624000+00:00) : are you depressed because glee is depressing or because the situation is depressing
125452744440938497 (2017-06-25T22:07:12.459000+00:00) : it took me a while to parse that one

125452744440938497 (2017-06-25T21:52:24.822000+00:00) : do you do that too? I thought i brought this up and i was the only one of my friends that did that
125452744440938497 (2017-06-25T21:51:50.694000+00:00) : they will probably just have higher fidelity and sound nicer
125452744440938497 (2017-06-25T21:51:33.668000+00:00) : they will sound more spacy and more like a 3d sound space that u are used to which is good for gaming
125452744440938497 (2017-06-25T21:51:08.785000+00:00) : they have a detachable cable so you can replace it if it breaks

125452744440938497 (2017-06-25T20:56:06.353000+00:00) : Lol im sure they haven't shipped it yet, it prolly lets you cancel
125452744440938497 (2017-06-25T20:55:11.780000+00:00) : Mm Keenan those might not be the best for plane rides
125452744440938497 (2017-06-25T20:36:31.007000+00:00) : the deal only lasts another 10 hours tho
125452744440938497 (2017-06-25T20:36:18.862000+00:00) : these are on sale for $50 and theyre almost definitely the best deal you're going to get in that price range

125452744440938497 (2017-06-25T06:37:48.635000+00:00) : He's very open when he drinks so I know maybe a little more about his sexual proclivities than I would desire but thats also besides the point
125452744440938497 (2017-06-25T06:36:46.383000+00:00) : But thats unrelated
125452744440938497 (2017-06-25T06:36:25.225000+00:00) : Maybe

125452744440938497 (2017-06-12T18:26:59.940000+00:00) : Yeah I think beyond might be best because it's at least someone documented
125452744440938497 (2017-06-12T18:25:23.704000+00:00) : The original packaging was for this Skyblock type challenge where you had to use tech to make all sorts of esoteric materials to feed a machine

125452744440938497 (2017-06-12T18:20:18.796000+00:00) : And making sure stuff like block IDs work together is a huge hassle manually

125452744440938497 (2017-06-01T00:50:02.363000+00:00) : its hard to get a sense of how popular mbmbam actually is
125452744440938497 (2017-06-01T00:49:52.435000+00:00) : how did griffin get named as a 30 under 30?
125452744440938497 (2017-06-01T00:48:46.612000+00:00) : lol
125452744440938497 (2017-06-01T00:46:55.602000+00:00) : he went to school in north carolina interesting
125452744440938497 (2017-06-01T00:46:43.955000+00:00) : eh 6 years
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T22:02:48.482000+00:00) : because the laura palmer story is compelling enough that it would be impossible to not be dissapointed if they just kinda shaggy dogged along like they were planning
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T22:02:13.678000+00:00) : i think it fits the original idea for the show which was that it was really about these weird people and this weird space almost better than the original premise
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T22:01:35.487000+00:00) : yeah and theres less tension because we know where cooper was all this time
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T22:00:41.281000+00:00) : theyre more spaces to explore themes than macguffins that drive the plot
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T22:00:26.170000+00:00) : I think all the mysteries of the show are good in that theres less room for dissapointment than 'who killed laura palmer'
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T21:58:55.862000+00:00) : in terms of pure aesthetics I think that sequence is my favorite thing lynch has ever done
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T21:58:33.958000+00:00) : all i want to learn about is Mother
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T21:57:44.097000+00:00) : but theres obvious elements from both in the show
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T21:57:35.409000+00:00) : like frost wrote the secret history and lynch did FWWM and they didnt collaborate at all on those
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T21:57:12.970000+00:00) : I really like that they seem to have taken as canon stuff about twin peaks both lynch and frost did without the input of the other
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T21:56:04.070000+00:00) : but they have so many places to go within that and so many interesting tidbits to explore
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T21:55:47.989000+00:00) : I feel like we have a sort of central conflict/goal now with cooper vs. cooper
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T21:55:05.566000+00:00) : yeah
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T21:52:38.027000+00:00) : yeah
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T21:52:14.106000+00:00) : I feel like the first 4 episodes have packed as much in as the entire first season
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T21:51:59.523000+00:00) : yeah man 18 is so many

125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T19:29:04.976000+00:00) : I've always been by far the warmest one in my relationships so idk that feel
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T19:23:47.377000+00:00) : If we have a good big/little spoon that's good, if we physically cannot simultaneously spoon and kiss that's bad
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T19:22:10.794000+00:00) : Like if I can pick her up during sex that's good, if I can pick her up with little effort that's just weird
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T19:20:48.415000+00:00) : Yeah but consider that 'significantly shorter' is a much bigger distance for me than for you
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T19:16:27.659000+00:00) : I feel like there's a bell curve for smallness where for someone my size the sex possibilities and cuddling compatibility get real good and then rel weird very fast
125452744440938497 (2017-05-31T19:15:21.599000+00:00) : Yeah that's probably near my limit for how short a person I'd date

125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T05:14:19.334000+00:00) : but its better than the alternative
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T05:14:03.773000+00:00) : yeah because you're intensely charismatic, which is only partially your fault
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T05:12:37.193000+00:00) : because it'll just get harder

125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T05:05:26.580000+00:00) : yeah i guess also the first few months of you and megan i was barely talking to you
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T05:03:20.751000+00:00) : and i felt like i noticed it a lot more with you around new years and stuff
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T05:03:04.398000+00:00) : i def only became comfortable with it bc of clara
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T05:02:53.976000+00:00) : interesting
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T05:00:27.857000+00:00) : do you think you're more physically intimate w her around other people than you were w megan
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:59:59.464000+00:00) : a question
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:59:07.285000+00:00) : i was about to say lol i dont really know that they just talk about jazz which makes me assume they are
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:57:31.241000+00:00) : also i feel like you've got a weird thing going now where she's pals w philip and sam so that makes things even harder
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:57:29.680000+00:00) : that's a little shitty of her tbh
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:57:18.526000+00:00) : ugh
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:55:59.326000+00:00) : and that sucks, im sorry
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:55:53.028000+00:00) : i've felt that in the past to some degree
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:52:05.612000+00:00) : as it is im just more flirty than i think i should be and i can get away with it
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:51:52.057000+00:00) : i think if i was a different person socially it would be more of a problem for me
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:49:52.036000+00:00) : the perils of being a good looking male
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:48:43.946000+00:00) : i was just way too physically attracted to her lol
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:48:35.050000+00:00) : yeah i sometimes think me and laura would have been better as friends
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:46:42.865000+00:00) : because i feel like thats what should define a relationship as opposed to like a deep friendship
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:46:24.715000+00:00) : like that was my turning point w my relationship when i realized that despite our differences im more comfortable around her than like anyone before
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:44:22.304000+00:00) : comfort is so so important
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:44:17.878000+00:00) : yeah yikes
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:42:29.542000+00:00) : that's not great
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:42:21.072000+00:00) : huh
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:40:21.911000+00:00) : like physically?
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:39:54.901000+00:00) : i think the emotional/spiritual aspect of things is where me and her are most different
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:39:24.337000+00:00) : i kinda feel like that sometimes
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:37:55.007000+00:00) : yes
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:34:21.040000+00:00) : that's fair
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:33:42.113000+00:00) : because for the first like year of being w clara i just always had this deep feeling of 'its not gonna work this isnt going to last'
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:33:11.776000+00:00) : i know how it is to feel like it just isnt meant to be
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:32:46.169000+00:00) : hmmm
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:27:33.681000+00:00) : with the commitment stuff do you feel like you couldnt be with her for a long time because of her, or just commitment issues in general?
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:26:13.285000+00:00) : yeah
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:24:44.341000+00:00) : yeah man that would be a whole new thing if i was still dating laura and working full time yikes i'd feel weird buying her stuff or offering to help with things
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:22:47.013000+00:00) : its a weird thing to think about
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:22:40.169000+00:00) : and clara comes from a decently wealthy backround (def higher than mine)
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:22:17.604000+00:00) : laura was like that
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:20:27.485000+00:00) : how r u and hannah doing?
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:20:11.180000+00:00) : lol
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:15:47.380000+00:00) : but yet i feel i could thrive in something different
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:15:24.541000+00:00) : i was nearly a hermit for a summer because i got broken up with ive never had to deal with real  shit lol
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:15:00.325000+00:00) : yeah and also its hard to think about whether adversity and struggle would give me meaning or kill me
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:14:30.838000+00:00) : lol
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:11:46.060000+00:00) : and the thought that i could just live my life just seeking things that distract me from that is not great
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:11:26.273000+00:00) : because like i dont just think the world is shit i think its on a precipice of becoming way worse
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:10:30.850000+00:00) : which i think is bad for many many reasons
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:10:18.528000+00:00) : because i think in latestage capitalism it can be kind of encouraging complicitness
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:09:54.271000+00:00) : the worthiness of making people a bit happier in their situation vs an 'opiate of the masses' type thing
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:09:33.419000+00:00) : yeah thats one of the things im trying to figure out
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:07:27.706000+00:00) : i dont shut down as bad as i did before antidepressants but its still something i wish i could control more
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:07:06.955000+00:00) : which is super sensitive
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:07:01.131000+00:00) : but i feel a lot of weird animosity towards ppl based on my own mood
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:06:45.355000+00:00) : like im rarely straight up a dick
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:06:32.207000+00:00) : i feel like im at this weird place where i feel all this stuff for ppl ive never met but in person its like 50/50
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:05:57.299000+00:00) : yeah
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:02:29.107000+00:00) : well thats the thing i dont want it to feed on me but i also feel that existing in american society is being very complicit
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T04:00:08.155000+00:00) : yeah
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:59:35.012000+00:00) : and also im like crazy empathetic so i just feel bad about too many things
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:58:59.827000+00:00) : which i desire for myself and otehrs
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:58:50.734000+00:00) : i think for me its connected to a belief that there must be a more fulfilling and authentic way of living
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:54:57.216000+00:00) : which i understand but would be hard for me
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:54:43.689000+00:00) : i think that's how clara feels about things
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:51:48.317000+00:00) : yeah see for me its kinda like that personally but careerwise id feel so bad if i didnt feel i was doing something that could help ppl substantially
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:47:51.772000+00:00) : because it keeps me from thinking about substantial things
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:47:31.709000+00:00) : yeah i came to the realization that i now play video games for emotional rather than mental escapism
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:45:45.216000+00:00) : also like 90% of my early desire to write was based around escapism and im trying to come to terms with how i feel about the relationship between escapism and moral living
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:45:04.878000+00:00) : yyep
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:41:22.701000+00:00) : yeah i read like 2 a week in high school
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:41:06.695000+00:00) : but at some point engaging with a book emotionally became way more difficult and thinking about the personal stuff needed to actually make one just seems daunting
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:40:19.526000+00:00) : and to some degree i still do
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:40:12.624000+00:00) : see i used to feel that way about books
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:37:39.237000+00:00) : right with headphones i can bathe in the endless discussions of which is better and actually obtaining anything is kinda just the carrot
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:35:26.740000+00:00) : it is *zizek voice* pure ideology
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:34:53.271000+00:00) : yeah for me its all the research
125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:32:22.309000+00:00) : yeah

125452744440938497 (2017-05-04T03:26:09.743000+00:00) : yeah i had to control myself because for a hot sec i considered getting into record collecting and i could see that just ruining me

125452744440938497 (2017-05-02T20:16:00.552000+00:00) : You can also be crafty about the specific demons you fuse to make sure the final demon has a good skillset
125452744440938497 (2017-05-02T20:15:04.394000+00:00) : It's p complicated but you get the hang of it
125452744440938497 (2017-05-02T20:13:47.095000+00:00) : For the complex fusions you don't have to have them all in your party or stock you just have to have had them at some point in time
125452744440938497 (2017-05-02T20:13:08.187000+00:00) : The game has pretty good tools for searching through your compendium for specific types of demons you've had or met before and you can summon them with macca for fusing

125452744440938497 (2017-04-08T05:08:12.890000+00:00) : he was like a shakespeare company carpenter for a long time
125452744440938497 (2017-04-08T05:07:55.755000+00:00) : he seems p cool and hardworking
125452744440938497 (2017-04-08T05:05:47.952000+00:00) : idk maybe not the worst life altogether it just seems like he was pretty all over the place as a person
125452744440938497 (2017-04-08T05:05:25.680000+00:00) : and just some of the decisions he made were kinda weird and bad
125452744440938497 (2017-04-08T05:05:04.474000+00:00) : there was that one episode where they just didnt do advice and talked about their childhoods and he talked about racking up a lot of cc debt and working a ton of dead-end jobs for a long time
125452744440938497 (2017-04-08T05:03:30.611000+00:00) : like hearing him talk about his young adulthood is kidna depressing
125452744440938497 (2017-04-08T05:03:13.465000+00:00) : at least before he started mbmbam

125452744440938497 (2017-04-08T05:02:13.392000+00:00) : but he also seems to have his shit together and be far more socially adeptmore than either of his brothers
125452744440938497 (2017-04-08T05:01:53.221000+00:00) : i feel like travis is in the weird position where he sometimes feels a little on a different wavelength as far as humor goes
125452744440938497 (2017-04-08T04:59:46.234000+00:00) : yeah i feel like once you cant take each other being around for granted you see them as people more
125452744440938497 (2017-04-08T04:58:16.587000+00:00) : i guess if our mom died we'd be sort of forced to bond to survive emotionally
125452744440938497 (2017-04-08T04:57:40.728000+00:00) : it makes me wish i had any sort of similar relationship with my brothers

125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T18:36:37.555000+00:00) : Go to mastsumo the forest blacksmith
125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T18:28:21.642000+00:00) : If you're short on cash you can sell all the machine cores you have for a shitton of money thats all they're for
125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T18:25:10.476000+00:00) : I wasn't looking for it I just kinda stumbled across it
125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T18:24:55.905000+00:00) : Nah I think its just kinda in a sand dune
125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T18:17:20.896000+00:00) : Its kind of along the east edge of the desert I believe
125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T18:14:20.431000+00:00) : Also the rocket pod you find in the desert is good vs that
125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T18:14:06.361000+00:00) : Just spam Dodge and get some hits in when you get a slowdown
125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T18:12:34.122000+00:00) : Over clock helps for that boss a lot
125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T18:08:52.906000+00:00) : I'm more annoyed that they basically reuse that design for the secret lv99 superboss
125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T18:08:28.231000+00:00) : I actually didn't have too much trouble with him
125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T18:07:54.694000+00:00) : Ballworm boy?
125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T17:58:38.236000+00:00) : Also I never used a2s berserk mode all that much but from what ive heard the best thing to do is get a high level offensive heal chip so you are life stealing and can sustain it as long as you can
125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T17:52:31.123000+00:00) : Time will slow down
125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T17:52:26.213000+00:00) : Also when you get access to the resistance weapons guy again or can travel to the forest blacksmith make sure you've upgraded your weapons as high as you can it doubles their damage with each level basically
125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T17:50:44.596000+00:00) : I was level 45 ish

125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T16:27:04.263000+00:00) : I think thats the first time you see machines affected by the logic virus
125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T16:26:45.185000+00:00) : Yeah

125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T16:22:42.596000+00:00) : It was crazy because you first see one in the hangar when 9s gets a flight unit to go help fight eve
125452744440938497 (2017-04-07T16:21:07.488000+00:00) : Yeah that part really pulls the carpet out from under you

125452744440938497 (2017-04-05T04:46:59.951000+00:00) : Yeah
125452744440938497 (2017-04-05T04:44:12.916000+00:00) : Is there any way to tell it to look for both final and week tickets?
125452744440938497 (2017-04-05T04:43:49.681000+00:00) : This ticketmaster app fucking sucks
125452744440938497 (2017-04-05T04:29:10.932000+00:00) : Idk I feel like since plane tickets cost so much I kinda want to stay the week but really just doing the finals does make more sense
125452744440938497 (2017-04-05T04:24:19.213000+00:00) : Yeah I don't think Keenan has any interest
125452744440938497 (2017-04-05T01:18:34.819000+00:00) : But we'd have to consider if we wanted to buy for a 3rd

125452744440938497 (2017-04-05T00:33:40.576000+00:00) : Plane tickets would also be a pain tho
125452744440938497 (2017-04-05T00:33:12.341000+00:00) : I mean it'd be a super cool experience

125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:25:08.626000+00:00) : i heard yoko taro described as like kojima but if instead of growing up on action movies and james bond he grew up on berserk and lovecraft
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:22:33.578000+00:00) : watch this german man lose his shit
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:22:27.314000+00:00) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll2qpvjc_XA
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:12:25.270000+00:00) : and nier actually rarely has more than 6 or 7 at one time
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:12:07.939000+00:00) : also the other big musou is a billion enemies
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:09:19.736000+00:00) : yeah
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:08:16.641000+00:00) : nier is definitelly not a musou lol
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:07:47.232000+00:00) : nier was inspired by god of war combat
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:07:37.067000+00:00) : drakengard 1 was a musou basically with air dragon combat
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:07:23.545000+00:00) : no
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:07:22.529000+00:00) : but theres also like multiverse shit and the fact that each game has like 3 endings makes things complicated
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:07:02.647000+00:00) : i've seen a timeline that posits drakengard 1 3 and nier as being in the same world and timeline
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:05:49.588000+00:00) : but there are some references to drakengard
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:05:38.611000+00:00) : and then nier automata is in the future of the nier world and has some references to the first one
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:05:06.307000+00:00) : not really
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:04:52.177000+00:00) : yeah basically
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:04:40.634000+00:00) : the lore is really obscure and takes some figuring out
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:04:28.449000+00:00) : but drakengard 3 is technically a prequel but the relation between it and 1 arent obvious at all
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:04:05.025000+00:00) : drakengard 2 was written by someone else and doesnt really have any relation
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:03:45.887000+00:00) : but that ending is what sets the events that lead to the world of nier in motion
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:03:25.231000+00:00) : and ends with a rythm game fight against a giant statue in modern tokyo
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:03:05.324000+00:00) : so drakengard 1 had a joke ending that was like an evangelion parody
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:02:43.651000+00:00) : yeah i know
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:02:40.147000+00:00) : but the lore is pretty nuts
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:02:28.434000+00:00) : clemp's videos are pretty decent
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:01:35.331000+00:00) : because i dont think anyone actually thinks those games are fun to play
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:01:21.848000+00:00) : you should also watch some videos on drakengard
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T02:01:09.711000+00:00) : absolutely

125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T01:14:10.193000+00:00) : remember when the 7.00 patchnotes leaked

125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:46:45.630000+00:00) : no
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:46:20.002000+00:00) : in all of fiction
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:46:16.112000+00:00) : is this perhaps the most powerful character
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:43:57.723000+00:00) : this image is like the oipposite of the effect you get when something gets stretched to widescreen that wasnt meant to be
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:42:38.039000+00:00) : this is your in to get hannah into comics

125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:42:29.197000+00:00) : In 2002, jazz percussionist Gregg Bendian released a seven-track CD, Requiem for Jack Kirby, inspired by Kirby's art and storytelling. Titles of the instrumental cuts include "Kirby's Fourth World", "New Gods", "The Mother Box", "Teaneck in the Marvel Age" and "Air Above Zenn-La".[169]
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:40:30.788000+00:00) : i know and its more memorable and striking than thanos or anything like that

125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:39:10.925000+00:00) : galactus has a better character design than like 90% of anything else in marvel
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:38:34.578000+00:00) : no keenan im 20

125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:37:26.359000+00:00) : 'but now we need someone for him to fight'
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:37:17.039000+00:00) : 'ok so this character is God'
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:35:01.343000+00:00) : with like goku and one punch man
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:34:54.733000+00:00) : its like when people try to make 'who would win'
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:34:13.998000+00:00) : like 'this character can do anything. but this character can kill them'
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:33:44.362000+00:00) : I still just love the idea of quatifying the power of these things
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:28:38.853000+00:00) : i think comic book origin mythos is actually somewhat limited by it being a visual medium
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:25:50.287000+00:00) : because thats just basic af
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:25:39.645000+00:00) : does he have a 1-1 correspondence with the infinite multiverses?

125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:23:35.603000+00:00) : "possibly in all of fiction"
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:23:20.057000+00:00) : "Another character that is also called "The One Above All" is the most powerful character In the entire Marvel franchise, possibly in all of fiction. This entity is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, and is responsible for the existence of all life in the Marvel Multiverse. The One-Above-All is the master of the cosmic overseer and arbitrator known as the Living Tribunal. This character is also known as "Above-All-Others", exists beyond all forms time and space, since they are all part of his creation, and alternates between appearing as a male and female"
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:23:10.619000+00:00) : and that shit
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:23:06.920000+00:00) : and thanos

125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:22:59.946000+00:00) : i knew about the watchers
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:22:53.127000+00:00) : and this shit is even more bananas then i originally thought
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:22:38.952000+00:00) : keenan im reading about the marvel divine beings
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:07:54.062000+00:00) : the nier/drakengard stuff is pretty wild
125452744440938497 (2017-03-28T00:07:41.134000+00:00) : if you guys are ever looking for some *deepest lore* to get into
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:27:56.765000+00:00) : yeah im sure theyrte fine just very much not my wheelhouse
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:21:12.226000+00:00) : but great names
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:21:08.990000+00:00) : will never ever watch any of those movies
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:20:49.410000+00:00) : i love all the fast names
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:18:56.719000+00:00) : the sma5h and the furious tokyo drift
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:18:23.182000+00:00) : sma5h
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:17:46.573000+00:00) : super smash switch
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:15:10.742000+00:00) : mass effect ground zeroes
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:11:36.199000+00:00) : the only reason mainstream reviewers are criticizing the dialogue and shit is because public opinion was already critical because of the animations and stuff
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:10:48.734000+00:00) : and lets be honest
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:10:41.283000+00:00) : yeah its really weird actually like it seems like making a mediocre ME game that got like 8.5s and 9s all around would not have been that hard
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:09:07.132000+00:00) : much like skyrim
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:08:59.996000+00:00) : but that's not necessarily because of the standout quality of each of its consituent components
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:08:40.613000+00:00) : yeah my point is that it's a impressive and ambitious series that is pretty unmatched
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:07:46.386000+00:00) : kinda standard sci fi stuff
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:07:38.356000+00:00) : yeah its impressively deep but still
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:06:50.018000+00:00) : like the story in the first two arent even that great its just the only AAA space opera video game
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:06:07.434000+00:00) : and I feel like bioware isnt capable of that
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:05:58.425000+00:00) : but you'd have to mix it up a lot and make it super interesting for me to want to get a new one
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:05:35.181000+00:00) : mainly because its pretty much the only time something like that has actually been done in a videogame
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T23:05:18.428000+00:00) : the thing with mass effect is that the first trilogy is good
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T22:48:21.919000+00:00) : You might put out some feelers for some other relatively light/generic systems
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T22:47:41.001000+00:00) : I'm down

125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T20:40:41.417000+00:00) : i think its explained in some stageplay he wrote that the blindfolds are combat visors but i think its mostly just a visual reference to emils design in the first nier
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T20:39:54.717000+00:00) : nah
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T20:34:16.392000+00:00) : yoko taro said in an interview he just likes girls

125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T20:27:18.279000+00:00) : whereas the machiones just exude a sort of sexual charisma
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T20:27:00.374000+00:00) : well for 2b its probably because you can see her diligently-crafted butt every time she jumps or uses a ladder
125452744440938497 (2017-03-27T20:26:13.865000+00:00) : the machine robots or the android robots

125452744440938497 (2017-01-22T21:55:04.303000+00:00) : What am I looking at here
125452744440938497 (2017-01-22T17:53:41.430000+00:00) : Winning consecutive bo1s against VP DC and IG is nothing to sneeze at

125452744440938497 (2017-01-22T01:29:57.326000+00:00) : yeah give me like 20 mins
125452744440938497 (2017-01-21T23:39:34.292000+00:00) : I mean I think like all of their marketing has been focused on the fact that its NOT a typical/hardcore console. Zelda is just the only one of their big franchises they have lined up for an actual lauch title. They're going heavy on the portable/social/convenience thing which I think has the potential to be huge but not having a bundled just makes it so much less appealing as a thing to buy for your kids and stuff like that
125452744440938497 (2017-01-21T23:32:07.297000+00:00) : that and the whole 'multiplayer is a phone app' thing
125452744440938497 (2017-01-21T23:31:53.310000+00:00) : thats one of the details that have come out that looks like a genuine blunder
125452744440938497 (2017-01-21T23:31:30.925000+00:00) : whats really weird is that its not bundled with the system
125452744440938497 (2017-01-21T23:22:16.125000+00:00) : anyone wanna play videogames
125452744440938497 (2017-01-21T18:34:36.759000+00:00) : I really want to play dota its been forever

125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T04:48:14.151000+00:00) : I started actually playing SMT Nocturne and it's simultaneously kind of goofy and badly written and the coolest game i have ever played
125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T03:50:29.409000+00:00) : i dont think thats remotely close to true keenan

125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T03:49:35.867000+00:00) : it is fundamentally a show about politics
125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T03:49:28.553000+00:00) : the fantasy is window dressing
125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T03:49:11.433000+00:00) : yeas, the show is about politics
125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T03:49:05.675000+00:00) : thats such an insult to alan moore and you know that
125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T03:47:56.202000+00:00) : its metaphorical in the most boring way possible
125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T03:47:37.039000+00:00) : The primary reason i dont like the fantasy is because i know its not in service of a larger vision
125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T03:46:10.073000+00:00) : live action television is the worst medium possible for grand fantasy stories
125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T03:45:50.336000+00:00) : also there are way better ones in animation
125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T03:45:02.063000+00:00) : thats like being the tallest dwarf
125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T03:44:44.015000+00:00) : otherwise its just masturbatory
125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T03:44:34.711000+00:00) : it is if your base material is solid
125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T03:44:22.436000+00:00) : because its not actually a series about anything remotely interesting happening
125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T03:44:10.617000+00:00) : Especially because you know that the lore will always be tangential
125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T03:43:56.899000+00:00) : lol game of thrones has the most boring fucking lore
125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T03:42:17.353000+00:00) : the thing is fantasy doesnt inherently make politics more interesting
125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T03:38:56.093000+00:00) : if its any consolation ronald i agree with you

125452744440938497 (2017-01-19T00:49:13.597000+00:00) : it was 70+tax for the special edition with the prime discount

125452744440938497 (2016-11-10T04:38:28.934000+00:00) : i think that'd be my sidearm of choice, a very compact revolver
125452744440938497 (2016-11-10T04:37:32.349000+00:00) : a time could come when id want a revolver that shoots miniature shotgun shells

125452744440938497 (2016-11-10T04:37:09.703000+00:00) : like it was this thing where he was this totally nice and kind and decently liberal guy who just owned a bunch of guns even though he didnt hunt (he lives in a very rural place to be fair)
125452744440938497 (2016-11-10T04:36:23.165000+00:00) : honestly though over the years my grandfather's view of firearms has become more and more reasonable to me
125452744440938497 (2016-11-10T04:35:06.055000+00:00) : no but it was a little alarming idk how id feel doing that in a high pressure situation
125452744440938497 (2016-11-10T04:34:43.427000+00:00) : so i could see that its not like in videogames
125452744440938497 (2016-11-10T04:34:33.698000+00:00) : my grandfather had me unload the entire clip of a colt 45 once

125452744440938497 (2016-11-10T04:28:58.516000+00:00) : but man do they make guns sound appealing with many features
125452744440938497 (2016-11-10T04:28:43.446000+00:00) : thinking about actually doing it is more sobering
125452744440938497 (2016-11-10T04:28:29.842000+00:00) : this is the most fun kind of online shopping actually i've spenty years browsing catalogs in my grandpa's catalogues
125452744440938497 (2016-11-10T04:27:47.704000+00:00) : the air guns are brighter colors usually
125452744440938497 (2016-11-10T04:26:42.316000+00:00) : which i dont, idk if you do
125452744440938497 (2016-11-10T04:26:19.621000+00:00) : ok so from what i see the only thing we'd have to do any paperwork for other than a background check would be if we actually wanted to carry the handgun around
125452744440938497 (2016-11-10T04:24:47.400000+00:00) : ok wait im finding conflicting things

125452744440938497 (2016-11-09T22:07:55.731000+00:00) : And over there the closest thing we have to a manager is on the verge of tears and saying she got in trouble and might get fired
125452744440938497 (2016-11-09T22:07:21.869000+00:00) : Then I took some dates over the the other store in the van which I had to lock up because there was an entire nee shower door in it along with some pricy wine

I’m not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he’s a major fucking hottie. I’m a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white skin. I’m also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I’m in the seventh year (I’m seventeen). I’m a goth (in case you couldn’t tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots.

125452744440938497 (2016-10-23T13:41:47.102000+00:00) : <@!155893986605793281> I had a dream where Mei from overwatch was hanging out with the crystal gems, and then she got captured by some cultists (one of whom may have been peridot), who were trying to essentially carry out the plot of neonomicon i.e. have her raped by a lovecraftian fish monster and get impregnated with a new cosmic horror. They failed because she was on birth control. The dream then turned into an extremely depressing and overly long Neil gaiman comic where she meditated on filth and vermin and extremely gross bugs throwing up other gross bugs out of which exploded dead birds being eaten by gross bugs in graphic detail. Mei concludes that the best way to keep that gross stuff away from her is to get all the filth and decay she is due in her life out of the way by having a horrifying child and she heads off to fuck Cthulhu and have his kid. The end of the dream was a bonus note in the graphic novel where Neil gaiman explains why he subjected me to way too many gross bugs (it's because he was depressed at the point of his life when he wrote that)
125452744440938497 (2016-10-23T01:25:45.104000+00:00) : finn the human and jake the dog are different episodes you might be confused

125452744440938497 (2016-10-18T03:32:22.591000+00:00) : its funny that you are the one arguing this with me, because I made that post in lieu of writing one about how much i hate hillary
125452744440938497 (2016-10-18T03:28:20.036000+00:00) : what i am saying is that directly contributing to activities and policies you ostensibly find distateful in order to curry favor in a swing state is cynical and disgusting
125452744440938497 (2016-10-18T03:27:32.959000+00:00) : all of that has literally nothing to do with what im saying
125452744440938497 (2016-10-18T03:23:29.225000+00:00) : because i guarantee you 100% that none of the people who donated to that have for example donated to political prisoners and their defense funds
125452744440938497 (2016-10-18T03:22:42.400000+00:00) : and it has nothing to do with letting opposing views be heard
125452744440938497 (2016-10-18T03:22:28.411000+00:00) : then directly funding their office is a tacit endorsement of that and incredibly hypocritical
125452744440938497 (2016-10-18T03:22:05.385000+00:00) : the bathroom bill state
125452744440938497 (2016-10-18T03:21:57.828000+00:00) : and this is north carolina we are talking about
125452744440938497 (2016-10-18T03:21:49.667000+00:00) : the point is, that if you genuinely believe that republicans, for example, cause a lot of harm to black people and lgbt people in that area
125452744440938497 (2016-10-18T03:20:48.589000+00:00) : it has absolutely nothing to do with how i personally feel about gop offices
125452744440938497 (2016-10-18T03:20:30.943000+00:00) : but regardless
125452744440938497 (2016-10-18T03:20:12.723000+00:00) : i would not give a shit

125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T04:31:47.067000+00:00) : and i find it difficult to communicate that feeling clearly with people often
125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T04:31:23.308000+00:00) : even stuff i care deeply about
125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T04:31:15.743000+00:00) : but just a way of thinking about the complexity and many sides and stuff like that
125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T04:30:39.426000+00:00) : insecurity
125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T04:30:33.016000+00:00) : i approach a lot of things and issues and situations with doubt not necessarily out of like
125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T04:30:15.118000+00:00) : idk i just feel like you are capable of approaching things or thinking about things in a similar way to me (the right way of describing it is eluding me right now)
125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T04:26:07.512000+00:00) : yeah i can see how that would be an issue
125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T04:26:00.992000+00:00) : but they are things i identify with a lot and one reason i value talking to you about serious things
125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T04:24:39.880000+00:00) : I think your self conciousness and self awareness are some of your significant positive traits (obviously not in all ways and theres many manifestations of those things)
125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T04:20:32.676000+00:00) : u also do the thing where you communicate sincere emotional stuff in your jokes voice and i know that turning off habits like that needs focus
125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T04:19:01.144000+00:00) : less so than in high school i feel
125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T04:16:53.867000+00:00) : you are just kind of casually dickish so bringing that to a level of more noticable intensity would require a lot of effort
125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T04:13:29.788000+00:00) : and you know how hateful i can make my eyes
125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T04:11:19.867000+00:00) : i must be slipping because i gave the gamestop employee me best silent death stare when he asked if i was looking for anything because he still asked perky followup questions
125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T04:04:25.232000+00:00) : or things i find more eerie or haunting than straight up creepy
125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T04:04:00.677000+00:00) : these are more subtle in general then the other ones

125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T03:56:30.850000+00:00) : one of my goals as a person is to be more aware of poverty as a dynamic in the way i talk about things
125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T03:53:10.457000+00:00) : but on the other im pretty sure he was talking about how he was gonna beat the shit out of his wife for cheating on him or something
125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T03:52:44.349000+00:00) : the guy who talked to me one night on the one hand it was a fascinating look into a guys mind who is so different from me and i appreciated that he was attempting to communicate something to me and he had his own sort of intelligence
125452744440938497 (2016-10-06T03:51:37.973000+00:00) : yeah

125452744440938497 (2016-09-19T00:10:52.942000+00:00) : “Benno,” William then said to me, “is the victim of a great lust, which is not that of Berengar or that
of the cellarer. Like many scholars, he has a lust for knowledge. Knowledge for its own sake. Barred
from a part of this knowledge, he wanted to seize it. Now he has it. Malachi knew his man: he used the
best means to recover the book and seal Benno’s lips. You will ask me what is the good of controlling
such a hoard of learning if one has agreed not to put it at the disposal of everyone else. But this is
exactly why I speak of lust. Roger Bacon’s thirst for knowledge was not lust: he wanted to employ his
learning to make God’s people happier, and so he did not seek knowledge for its own sake. Benno’s is
merely insatiable curiosity, intellectual pride, another way for a monk to transform and allay the
desires of his loins, or the ardor that makes another man a warrior of the faith or of heresy. There is
lust not only of the flesh. Bernard Gui is lustful; his is a distorted lust for justice that becomes
identified with a lust for power. Our holy and no longer Roman Pontiff lusts for riches. And the
cellarer as a youth had a lust to testify and transform and do penance, and then a lust for death. And
Benno’s lust is for books. Like all lusts, including that of Onan, who spilled his seed on the ground, it is
sterile and has nothing to do with love, not even carnal love. ...”
“I know,” I murmured, despite myself. William pretended not to hear. Continuing his observations, he
said, “True love wants the good of the beloved.”
